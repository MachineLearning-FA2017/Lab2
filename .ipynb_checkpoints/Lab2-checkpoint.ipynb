      "['“It’s like owning your own newspaper – without the losses.” That’s how Donald Trump described the San Francisco-headquartered social media tool in November 2012. In a little over four years, the celebrity businessman turned president-elect has grown his Twitter audience from about 2 million followers to almost 19 million, using it as his personal Pravda to post propaganda and stream-of-consciousness musings . His prolific and opinionated 140-character outpourings (“tremendous!”, “very unfair!”, “crooked”, “nice”) are amplified by traditional media, reporting on his ad hominem attacks and diplomatic gaffes. For Twitter, it’s been a marketer’s dream: barely a day goes by without TV channels, newspapers and websites name-checking the social media platform in stories about what @real Donald Trump is posting. President-elect Trump promises to Make America Great Again, but could he also Make Twitter Great Again? Twitter had a troubled 2016, with a series of high-profile executives leaving the company a s it struggled to attract more users (it s user base has plateaued at around 300 million) and suffered from slowing revenue growth. There were rumours the company might be sold to Salesforce or Disney, but discussions were not fruitful. Since then the company has been in cost-cutting mode, shedding staff and paring back some of its business operations, including video-sharing platform Vine. Now the company could benefit from its most talked-about user’s ascent to the White House. “Trump is the best thing that ever happened to Twitter,” said analyst Michael Pachter, from Wedbush Securities. “It’s like E.T. eating Reese’s Pieces!” he said, referring to one of the earliest examples of product placement. So keen on the platform is Trump that he’s even using it to announce potential policy changes, bypassing the conventions of White House press team filters. Despite promising in November to be “very restrained, if I use it at all” in his social media use once he’s president, Trump has already hinted he’d like to change decades of policy on nuclear weapons and praised Vladimir Putin as “very smart”, even after intelligence agencies said Russia tried to influence the US election . Trump hasn’t held a traditional press conference since July 2016, opting instead for combining controlled settings of interviews with Twitter, which he views as a way of “fighting back” against stories he considers to be inaccurate or bad. “This is his way of controlling the news cycle. He’s brilliant at that,” said analyst Leigh Drogen, founder and CEO of Estimize. Trump’s use of the microblogging platform is raw and, for a person of his stature, unprecedented – or, to use the term he erroneously tweeted, ‘unpresidented’ . But it is a huge marketing asset for the tech firm, which is being portrayed by Trump and his associates as an influential tool. “You know what? The fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results,” Trump’s incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, recently remarked. The question is, can Twitter convert such a priceless endorsement into business success? “I’ve not yet seen Twitter do anything to market the site to non-users. They are failing to exploit an opportunity,” said Pachter. Drogen agrees, citing Mark Zuckerberg in describing the company as “a clown car that fell into a goldmine”. “They have never actually grown out of that. They just fell into where they are. Trump will keep them relevant but it’s up to Twitter to figure out how to appeal to a larger set of people,” Droge said. He pointed out that because of the lack of effective marketing, most non-users of Twitter joke that its purpose is to tell people what you had for breakfast. Twitter’s real value, he said, is as a breaking news source and that not all users need to post content. “99% of people should just be following news sources and celebrities, but Twitter has never really made that connection for people.” Pachter is more hopeful, arguing that having shed most of the company’s management team CEO Jack Dorsey now has a “blank slate”. “Every person who voted for Trump should be following him on Twitter. Why aren’t they marketing it to the RNC?” The flipside of Trump’s presence on Twitter, however, is the swell of harassment on the platform, much of which is fuelled by the pro-Trump alt-right. This has led to a number of high-profile departures from the platform. “I think harassment is a problem. There are no consequences for being an asshole on Twitter and there should be,” said Pachter, who suggests an Uber-style rating system for users, where people would get suspended for the site for a short period if they continually got bad scores. Both Pachter and Drogen are intrigued to see what will happen with the @realDonaldTrump account once the president-elect is inaugurated. By that point he may be using the official White House @POTUS Twitter account. “Normally the president takes a very nuanced view of what he wants to say and goes through several levels of filter before it gets out to people,” said Drogen. Trump’s recent tweets do not suggest he is about to adopt a more presidential approach to his account. Drogen believes that once in power, however, the gap between what Trump says on Twitter and what he does will become more obvious, particularly when it comes to business , where he’s been able to shift financial markets with single tweets . “He’s going to keep saying crazy stuff because his brain is connected to fingers and fingers are connected to the phone, but I think the market is going to discount those things.” He added: “It’s not real policy, it’s literally just a dude saying things.” Perhaps that could be Twitter’s new strapline?', 'Two years ago, some European and US experts gathered to discuss China in an elegant English country house. The setting was seductive, but the mood was dark. Two years into Xi Jinping’s presidency, China’s politics were turning away from the liberalising trend of the previous three decades, towards a hard-edged nationalism that was discomfiting China’s immediate neighbours and their western allies. China was getting more powerful but less friendly, squeezing foreign competition out of its internal markets, throwing its weight around the South China Sea, crushing internal dissent and enforcing loyalty to the regime. The mostly liberal-minded scholars had assumed that the spectacular success of China’s economic opening and partial political relaxation would lead to a more open society, greater rule of law and more political inclusion. They were dismayed to discover that Xi’s mission was not to steer China towards political pluralism and tolerance, but to shore up the Communist party, in defiance of what the scholars had assumed was an inevitable trend: that an emerging middle class would always force a political opening. If that was not going to happen, given China’s vastly increased influence in the world, a global conflict between the systems, values and norms of the pluralist, democratic United States and China’s Communist party seemed inevitable. It would be unpleasant, but nobody doubted that US values would prevail. The group discussed whether China could succeed. What might go wrong? Would China reset the world’s economic and security arrangements in its favour? What could the US do to defend its norms and values beyond concluding the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the huge US-led Pacific trade initiative, and shoring up political security guarantees to its close regional allies, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, to limit the growth of China’s influence?\\nThe one scenario not discussed was that the US would tear up its own rules, leaving the field open to China to consolidate its dominance of the Asia Pacific and extend its global influence. Nobody\\xa0even imagined such a far-fetched possibility. Donald Trump’s actions seem to have surprised Beijing as much as they have dismayed America’s allies. Now the challenge for China is how to reap the benefits and contain the inevitable damage. In terms of international diplomacy, things are going well. It’s hard to imagine Trump quoting Thucydides, or Stephen Hawkins or Herman Hesse, or cramming references to Pandora’s box, the Peace of Westphalia and the sword of Damocles into a 58-minute plea for peace and international cooperation. Such a carefully crafted speech might have been delivered by previous US presidents, since it paid fulsome homage to the core values the US has promoted since 1945. But this was delivered by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist party and president of the China, to an audience at the United Nations in Geneva in January. China’s proposition to the world, Xi said, was to “build a community of shared future for mankind and achieve shared and win-win development”. Such a claim might previously have encountered polite scepticism. Today, it receives an almost uncritical welcome. Trump has charged China with “raping” the US, a word he might have avoided for other reasons. Xi reminded his audience of China’s contribution to global economic stability since the financial crisis, of an average of 30% of global growth each year. “In the coming five years,” he predicted, “China will import $8tn of goods, attract $600bn of foreign investment, make $750bn of outbound investment, and Chinese tourists will make 700 million outbound visits.”\\nXi’s commitment to global capitalism is convincing, given China’s dependence on exports. More audacious was his contention that “we always put people’s rights and interests above everything else and have worked hard to advance and uphold human rights”. Human rights organisations were excluded from the occasion. But if Xi’s claim is contestable, it pales in comparison with the exaggerations, false claims and threats by Trump and his circle. There will be few winners in a world of escalating tensions and disruption. China would not have picked this moment for a fight with the US. But if it can consolidate its own economic arrangements in the region and beyond, using its economic muscle to its diplomatic and political advantage while escaping the burden of censure that its internal repression has provoked to date, it will be a huge win for China. Trump’s singular achievement in his short time as president has been to trash US soft power assets and make China’s regime look less objectionable. Before Trump, even as western countries scrambled to access the Chinese market, they regarded Beijing with scepticism. Why should anyone believe the global message of a regime that does not tolerate dissent or domestic challenges? But that is now a question we must begin to ask of the US. China’s official untruths seem modest in comparison with those of a man who can barely get through a sentence without a lie. For Beijing, the question now is how far an attempt to replace US influence is possible or desirable. For US allies, the question is how far should we wish Beijing success?', 'Always quick to get to the point, social media came up with an instant distillation of the global response to the improbable, unsettling election of Donald Trump as president of the United States: #RIPAmerica.\\nThat hashtag declared that we had witnessed something more than a simple change of government. (Such a slogan would not have circulated had Mitt Romney beaten Barack Obama in 2012.) Instead, it implied that Trump had not merely taken over the running of the United States for four years, but that his presidency represented a much darker threat – that it would, in fact, destroy the country. Of course, Twitter is prone to the hyperbolic and hysterical. But more sober commentators were raising a similar prospect, albeit in not quite such stark terms. David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker, spoke for many when he wrote: “The election of Donald Trump to the presidency is nothing less than a tragedy for the American republic, a tragedy for the constitution, and a … sickening event in the history of the United States and liberal democracy … It is impossible to react to this moment with anything less than revulsion and profound anxiety.” For the millions who shared that sentiment, dawn on Wednesday felt like mourning in America. What they fear is that Trump will make good on all the promises – and threats – he made during these last 18 months. What if he goes ahead and deports 11.3 million undocumented migrants? What if he really does ban all Muslims entering the country? What if he tries to use the powers of the state to go after media organisations that have criticised him – making life difficult for the businesses that own inquisitive newspapers such as the Washington Post, for example – as he has said he will? What if he overturns abortion rights, even imposing “some form of punishment” on a woman who terminates a pregnancy, as he once suggested? And what if he really does build that wall?\\nThere are plenty who believe that if Trump went ahead and actually implemented his programme, he would create a different country: closed, xenophobic and at odds with some of the founding principles – religious equality or freedom of speech – that have defined the United States since its founding. The country would still exist – but it would no longer be America. Naturally, there is a ready chorus of self-styled realists and grownups, quick to say that such talk is excessive. Those voices offer assorted forms of reassurance. First, they make the perennial claim that every successful politician – whatever the bluster and rhetoric of the campaign – always moderates once in office. This view holds it to be all but a law of nature that the radicalism of the candidate is always tempered by the reality of governing. Trump may have talked up a storm on his way to the White House, they say, but once behind the desk of the Oval Office, pragmatic, practical considerations will surely constrain him. What’s more, runs the argument, there are formal mechanisms in place to do just that. The United States, after all, is ruled by a constitution that insists on the separation of powers, so that the executive – the president – can never go too far, always held in check by both the independent judiciary, in the form of the supreme court, and the legislature, Congress. These venerated institutions will surely prevent Trump from doing anything too crazy. Less august, perhaps, but also to be taken into account is the federal bureaucracy: a vast civil service of non-partisan technocrats, who will ensure that any Trump proposal is softened and smoothed into shape, sanding off its harsher, more wild edges. And there is always the military: they surely won’t let Trump get out of hand. The trouble is, none of those reassurances stacks up. Start with the notion that once he has sworn the oath of office, Trump is bound to tone it down, dropping his most incendiary plans. The trouble with that idea is that party bigwigs were saying the same thing throughout the campaign, earnestly hoping that Trump would change once he became the frontrunner, that he would change once he won the party nomination, that he would change once he started the campaign proper in September. Normal candidates do indeed do that. But with Trump, it never happened.\\nInstead, he kept sounding off, insulting bereaved military parents one minute, a former Miss Universe the next. The only time he agreed to take direction was in the very final week, when he finally stuck to a message and read scripted lines from a teleprompter. But that was just for a few days, when the big shiny prize was in sight. It is a slim foundation on which to build the hope that a 70-year-old man with a proven lack of impulse control – “I just grab them by the pussy” – will miraculously transform himself the minute he walks through the door of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But if the restraint won’t come from within, what about from without? Won’t there be institutions to hold Trump in check? The trouble is, Republicans did not only win the presidency, they also won both houses of Congress. That gives Trump enormous power, a strength that has eluded most of his predecessors. (George W Bush governed with a Republican Congress for a short spell. Before him, the last Republican to enjoy such untrammelled might was Herbert Hoover in 1928.) The result is that Trump will face no congressional constraint. They will do his bidding. Some have suggested that, while their party affiliation might be the same, Trump will nevertheless encounter resistance on Capitol Hill because so many congressional Republicans are hostile to him. They cite the House speaker, Paul Ryan, who publicly clashed with Trump several times on the campaign – once accusing him of making a “textbook example of a racist comment” – and who endorsed Trump only through gritted teeth.\\nBut Ryan will not dare oppose Trump now. Trump is the one with the national mandate, the winner of a much larger electoral college victory than anyone ever thought possible. Trump won states that had eluded the Republicans for decades: he even took Pennsylvania, which had been in Democratic hands since 1988. That gives him huge clout inside the Republican party. He succeeded in doing what they had long failed to do, expanding the map and winning over white working-class voters who had previously spurned them. And so Republicans in Congress will be the junior partners in this new relationship, forced to bow to the man whose electoral appeal is so much stronger than theirs. He won’t be their creature; they will be his. If representatives were to dare to step out of line, Trump will ask them who the voters in their districts – who will almost certainly have voted for him – would back. The answer will always be him. That pressure won’t be applied only to Republicans. Witness this exchange between Newt Gingrich, rumoured to be a possible secretary of state in a Trump administration, and journalist Evan Osnos. Osnos had asked about the proposed border wall with Mexico, wondering if a Trump administration would really be able to get Congress to pay for it (given that no one believes Mexico ever would, despite Trump’s hot air, pay for it itself). Gingrich replied that he would use the pressure of re-election to bring doubters around. “Remember how many Democrats are up for election in the Senate in 2018,” Gingrich said, adding that the answer was 25. “Do you really want to go home as the guy who stopped the fence? Then, by all means, but we’ll build it in ’19.” So if Congress promises to be supine, what of the supreme court, surely the ultimate restraint? That body has a vacancy, ready to be filled by the next president. Trump can nominate a pliant judge and the Senate will be unlikely to resist. That would instantly give Trump a 5-4 conservative majority on the highest court. And with several other supreme court justices in their late 70s or 80s, other vacancies could appear soon, too. Trump will have the chance to reshape the court in his image. (He can do the same for the lower courts, too, rapidly filling up the federal bench with Trump-friendly lawyers.)\\nAnd remember, once on the court, a judge can stay for life. So Trump’s impact will be felt for a generation. He could have the numbers to overturn Roe v Wade, the ruling that gives women abortion rights; to further entrench so-called gun rights, reducing what few restrictions currently exist (he has proposed that schoolteachers be armed); or even to reinterpret the first amendment to allow for his proposed tightening of the libel laws: Trump wants the right to pursue journalists who have criticised him, so that “we can sue them and win lots of money”. As for the federal bureaucracy, the US system is not like the one in Britain. A new president does not have to confine himself to appointing a handful of special advisers, fitting them into an existing, politically neutral machine. He makes a staggering 4,000 appointments, staffing the entire top layer of government – all owing their jobs and total loyalty to him. So, no, there will be no civil service to stop Donald Trump. They will be Trump’s servants. (It’s said that the military will behave in the same way: they will not want to be seen resisting democratically elected, civilian power.) In other words, Trump will have enormous power from inauguration day on 20 January 2017. He can build his border wall if he wants to – and, so memorable was the promise, the political penalty for not doing so will be enormous. But he can do much, much more besides. On day one, he can – at the stroke of a pen – undo much of the Obama legacy. Trump has had a team of aides draw up what they call the First Day Project, a series of executive orders signed by Obama that Trump could overturn with his signature before he has got his feet under the desk. Among the measures they have targeted for repeal are: the Paris agreement on climate change, the Syrian refugee programme and the rules demanding checks on the background of someone seeking to buy a gun. By the end of that first day, America would already be a changed country. Once work starts on the border wall, Trump’s most vociferous supporters will demand action on the president-elect’s other signature proposal: the deportation of those migrants. With Republican control of the House and Senate, he will have no excuses for inaction or delay. On this, too, there has been some advance work. One thinktank envisages a force of 90,000 “apprehension personnel”, equipped to make raids on farms, restaurants and building sites, rooting out illegal immigrants. As Osnos reported: “Thousands of chartered buses (54 seats on average) and planes (which can accommodate 135) would carry deportees to the border or to their home countries.” Others have talked of putting these unwanted people on trains and expelling them – a method that evokes the darkest chapter in European history.\\nIn the meantime, Trump could work on his ban on Muslims entering the US. The constitution might strike that down as discrimination on grounds of religion, but it would not be too hard to refashion it. Indeed, Trump has spoken of banning arrivals from countries associated with “Islamic terrorism”, which may be an effective workaround. And all the while, Trump would be shredding the legacy of America’s first black president, abolishing Obamacare which gave millions health insurance. But there is another promise Trump will want to implement. It came during the TV debates when Trump pledged that, if he won, he would put Hillary Clinton in jail over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. He can’t do that directly, but he could steer his Justice Department to pursue her, perhaps via a special prosecutor. Who would stop him doing that? His base will demand nothing less: their cries of “Lock her up!” are still ringing. (The only thing that might stay his hand is if he calculates that the threat of prosecution provides useful leverage, a sword to hang over the heads of the Clintons, to ensure they keep quiet and out of his way.) So this is the country that Trump – unshackled and unbound – can forge, starting three months from now. Oblivious to the environment, hostile to migrants, snarling towards Muslims and seeking to roll back rights that took decades to secure. It would be a country that saw the constitution not as its greatest gift, but as an obstacle to overcome. It would see diversity not as a strength, but as a fact to be tolerated, at best. And anyone objecting to any of this would find the big institutions, all three branches of government, arrayed against them. RIP America? It certainly might feel that way. For what we saw in the astonishingly ugly campaign fought by Donald Trump would be only an inkling of what is to follow. Or, as one senior Democrat put it to me: “The horror show has not even started. This is just the overture.”', '', 'A documentary telling the inside story of Donald Trump’s stunning presidential election victory has been added to the Sundance film festival lineup. Trumped: Inside the Greatest Political Upset of All Time has been put together by the team behind the Showtime network’s election series, The Circus: Inside the Greatest Political Show on Earth, which ran from January to November 2016 and covered the presidential race in detail over 26 episodes. No screening date has been confirmed, but Trump’s inauguration will take place on 20 January, on the second day of the festival. Sundance has also added the world premiere of Newness, the new film by festival favourite Drake Doremus, whose 2011 film Like Crazy won the grand jury prize. Newness stars Nicholas Hoult, Laia Costa and Danny Huston, and is described as a contemporary romance set in Los Angeles in which “two millennials navigating a social media-driven hookup culture begin a relationship that pushes both emotional and physical boundaries”. The Sundance film festival runs from 19-29 January in Park City, Utah.', '', 'Trump to visit Mexican president ahead of immigration speech Donald Trump is heading to Mexico today for a meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto, before making a long-awaited speech clarifying his position on immigration in Arizona tonight. Trump, who once linked immigrants from Mexico to “rapists” and has vowed to build a wall on the US’s southern border , confirmed the meeting in a tweet. Nieto said he had invited Trump, despite having previously compared him to Hitler and vowed to resist paying for Trump’s wall. “I believe in dialogue to promote the interests of Mexico in the world and to protect Mexicans wherever they are,” he said. Trump will reportedly be accompanied on the trip by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Alabama senator Jeff Sessions. Here Ben Jacobs looks at what to expect from Trump’s speech in Arizona as he tries to balance hardline rhetoric with an appeal to Latino voters. The Republican nominee has begun what he called a rhetorical “softening” on the question of deporting illegal immigrants in recent weeks, raising questions about whether he was ever sincere in his hardline stance. Trump confirms trip to Mexico for talks with President Peña Nieto Isis leader confirmed killed The Islamic State news agency reports that spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani was killed “surveying operations” in Aleppo. Adnani was one of Islamic State’s longest-serving and most prominent leaders and his loss is considered a significant blow to the terror group. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, said coalition forces had conducted an airstrike in the town of al-Bab in Aleppo province on Tuesday targeting Adnani, but did not say whether he had been killed. Very few members of the original leadership remain alive. Key Isis leader killed in Syria, jihadi group says Apple’s EU tax battle escalates As Apple vows to resist an EU fine (including penalties) of around $14.5bn over its “sweetheart” tax arrangements with the Irish government, the reaction in Silicon Valley is one of shock and disappointment. “The EU is trying to change the rules of the game retroactively. It makes little sense to me,” said Om Malik of the San Francisco venture capital firm True Ventures. “These companies have been complying with the Irish rules. Now a lot of them will have to re-evaluate their relationships with Europe.” Silicon Valley outraged by Apple tax bill: ‘Europe is changing rules retroactively’ Hillary Clinton’s Honduran problem While secretary of state, the Democratic presidential nominee supported new elections in Honduras following a 2009 coup, rather than the return of the sitting president, Manuel Zelaya, viewed by some as a leftist troublemaker. What followed was a sell-off of mining and hydroelectric concessions that have arguably contributed to the poverty and disenfranchisement behind Honduras’s current political instability, and Clinton’s White House run has brought a new focus on the events of seven years ago as the consequences continue to reverberate. Hillary Clinton’s response to Honduras crisis draws scrutiny amid violence UK Brexit talks The new British prime minister, Theresa May, is meeting with her ministers for the first time since the summer break to discuss exactly how the UK will leave the European Union. She has already ruled out “attempts to stay in the EU by the back door” and the prospect of a second referendum on Brexit. No staying in the EU by the back door, says Theresa May Trump TV – a presidential consolation prize? According to popular theory in media circles, Donald Trump has given up on winning the presidential race and is now simply priming the pump for a forthcoming media venture for the “alt-right” demographic. The idea has popped up in the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, which reported that Trump is looking to “monetize” his audience through a possible “mini-media” conglomerate. Trump TV: is his campaign laying the groundwork for the next media empire? Brazil gears up for Dilma Rousseff impeachment The Brazilian senate is expected to vote today to oust Dilma Rousseff from the presidency and confirm interim president Michel Temer as the country’s leader. Here we offer a guide to the crisis. How bad is it? “On a scale of one to 10, it has felt to many Brazilians like an 11,” writes Jonathan Watts. “An ongoing crackdown on bribery and graft has effectively paralyzed the government because bribes were essential for building coalitions.” Dilma Rousseff impeachment: what you need to know – the Guardian briefing US Open kicks off – with an expletive-filled rant If the Guardian’s Bryan Armen Graham was expecting a relaxing afternoon of opening-round tennis at Flushing Meadows he didn’t get one when Australia’s Bernard Tomic lashed out at spectators after going down two sets on his way to a 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 loss to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Damir Džumhur. “Suck my balls,” the 23-year-old Australian chirped. “I will put my balls in your mouth.” After Džumhur missed on his first serve, Tomic continued: “I will give you some money to make you feel good.” Bernard Tomic delivers foul-mouthed insult to spectator at US Open In case you missed it … The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, has confirmed that he considers naked breasts represent France better than a headscarf. Referring to Marianne, a national symbol of the French Republic, but perhaps thinking of Eugène Delacroix’s 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People, Valls said: “Marianne has a naked breast because she is feeding the people! She is not veiled, because she is free! That is the republic!” Mathilde Larrere, a historian of the French revolution, tweeted: “Marianne has a naked breast because it’s an allegory, you cretin!” French PM suggests naked breasts represent France better than a headscarf', 'In the postscript to the 2016 US election, the inability of pollsters to gauge Donald Trump’s support in key swing states, from Florida through the rust belt to Michigan and Wisconsin, is being widely studied. Who were these “underground” Trump voters? Were they ignored? Did they hide themselves in plain sight? The same – discredited – pollsters now say white women carried Trump to victory. But it was more than that. In North Carolina, with its rapidly changing demographics, the polls predicted a tight race. The candidates visited the state almost 30 times, each fishing for the state’s 15 electoral college votes. In her final campaign rally on the eve of Tuesday’s vote, Clinton was on stage there with Lady Gaga. Twenty-four hours later, she learned she had lost the state to Trump by four points, 51%-47% – a loss that did not guarantee his victory nationally, but strongly suggested it. Since the result last week, many Americans who kept their Trump support private have began to reveal themselves. As with the Brexit referendum vote, the decision has caused familial rifts. Here, North Carolinian voters explain their decision-making.\\nJames Morrison, 25 I was freaked out about Hillary because there were 33,000 emails that we’ll never know what was in there. To not let the FBI review them after you’d been subpoenaed? That’s a huge concern for me. I voted for Obama because he wanted to bring change and unity. Hillary was more talk than walk and more transparency would have been good. I have a lot of friends who voted for Hillary. If she’d kept Sanders I’d have been more inclined to go toward her, but I liked Trump on trade because it’s true we’re losing a lot of jobs to China.\\nTracy Guthrie, 47 Trump was not my first pick but I’m from a military family and I don’t believe Hillary Clinton had any respect for the military. Any military person who destroys emails and lies about it would be buried underneath the jail. Trump was disgusting because of what he said about women, but he was the lesser of two evils. I don’t think everybody should be deported. I’m not homophobic, I’m not racist. I’m pro-military, and I don’t believe she is. We need a strong military because we live in crazy world.\\nTova Mandissa, 43 Clinton was in the chair too long. She knows her way around truth. But Trump is a self-made man. You don’t have to be a politician to be a president, you just have to know how to better yourself. I’ve seen those TV shows – The Apprentice – and he was good with African-Americans and we need a very strong man. I like to see who someone is. You are who you are. At least he’s not the kind of person to get in the White House as one thing and then – boom – here’s who I really am. I know who he is up front. Plus they were not going to treat her right as a woman, they weren’t going to treat her fairly.\\nLouis Coletta, 78 I’m a small businessman and Obama never did anything for small business except tie us up in red tape. He offered hope and change, but it wasn’t change for the better, at least not for business people. The south has traditionally been very poor. The Democrats offered something for free. But I don’t want something for free. My granddad was an immigrant from Italy. His ice-cream business is now third generation. I think a man’s a fool if he has his own business and he’s a Democrat. Trump appeals to me because I think he’s going to shake things up. Everybody’s ready for change.\\nScott Sandlin, 49 Trump wasn’t worried about speaking his mind. Sure he flip-flops a lot, but he was talking about the working man and bringing back jobs. He’s not a politician, got his own money so he really can’t be bought. We’d seen enough dirt on Bill and Hillary. It seemed like an old story and we needed a change. I think he’s going to shake it up. I like it when he said it was time for Republicans and Democrats to work together, to bring America back to where it was before – great. I don’t make enough from a 10-bucks-an-hour job to pay for health insurance. But I have to admit to you what my grandmother said: “When the Clintons were in before, times were great.” But times they are a-changin’, the old Bob Dylan thing.\\nMichael, 29 I usually vote independent. But this time I voted Trump because things ain’t working. The economy hadn’t bounced back like they wanted it to. My wife and I, we struggle. I like Trump’s business sense. He could get rid of the fraud and unnecessary expense. Hillary Clinton had a lot of experience but it wasn’t all good experience. Her trustworthy stuff was big for me. The investigations and FBI stuff might be normal for a lot of politicians, but it wasn’t normal or appropriate for me. Trump’s a businessman. It doesn’t bother me he went into bankruptcy. Not every idea can be a great idea and he climbed out of that hole.', 'This election season has inspired acres of commentary about the effectiveness of political satire against an unprecedented candidate like Donald Trump. But after 18 excruciating months, the big day is finally upon us, and the state of political comedy seems as uncertain as the state of the country at large. Samantha Bee has had a good election: her fire-and-brimstone comedy about the evils of Trump and his ilk has given her a powerful new voice sure to remain vital beyond the election. Given that her fury extends beyond Trump to the inequality and bigotry that has infected the body politic, she is sure to have plenty to rage at in the coming years – no matter who wins. Another of the most successful breakout comedians of this election, Anthony Atamanuik, seems to have had enough. Atamanuik spent much of the year touring his Donald Trump impression in the brilliant Trump v Bernie debates with James Adomian. After Trump clinched the nomination, Atamanuik switched to one-man “Trump Dump” rallies, where he gave long, Trumpish speeches in the Republican candidate’s signature rambling style.\\nAt a show on Thursday night at the New York comedy festival, however, both he and his audience seemed to have had their fill of the election. For his final Trump rally, Atamanuik ditched the parody and launched his own spiel, a personal, leftist take on the history of oppression in America and the laziness of modern-day slacktivism. When he pulled the Trump wig off at the end of the show, the message was clear – we need to leave this guy in the dust.\\nSo how will comedians – late-night hosts and standups alike, many of whom barely came to grips with the unparalleled absurdity of the Trump campaign – handle a world after today? If Clinton wins, it may be tempting for some to shift back to normal as soon as possible, with the “give it to both sides” mentality that has been the traditional approach to American satire. But has the way some comedians and writers have been so unabashedly partisan in their attacks on Trump broken the seal of balance, pushing comedy into advocacy? In a recent Late Night with Seth Meyers piece for instance, the host was unequivocal in his feelings about election day, comparing Clinton’s problem – someone who was under federal investigation for using a private email server – versus a seemingly never-ending list of Trump’s sins.\\nClinton has had her fair share of mockery over the decades, but her shortcomings are so much less baroque than her opponent’s that she’s had an easy ride. Will comedians move back into mocking her ruthlessness, Bill’s affairs, her paranoia – as if they hadn’t been glossing over it for the past six months? Or will they stay kind, just grateful that she’s the one who made it to the Oval Office? Predicting how the satirical class would react to a Trump win is even harder. Early in the race, Trump seemed like a goldmine for comedians, but his sheer grotesquery often put him beyond satire. Trump may have taken offense at Alec Baldwin’s impression of him on Saturday Night Live, but such spot-on mimicry hasn’t had the devastating effect that great impressions – like Tina Fey’s Sarah Palin – have had in the past.\\nOne consistent point of mockery has been Trump’s looks – his outrageous hair and unnatural skin tone have been central to mocking him for years. Bee has perhaps been better at it than anyone, as this compilation of her Trump thesaurus proves:\\nBut will it still be funny to refer to President Trump as a “melting hunk of uninformed apricot Jell-O” in the third year of his term? Even by the low bar of typical political discourse, this election has been abysmally short on policy discussions, particularly where Trump is involved. Are comedians ready to hit him on executive decisions? How will they frame their approach to his presidency? What comedic narrative would define a Trump administration? Like most people, comedians were not fully prepared for a Trump candidacy. After years of politicians like George Bush, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, the comedy institution didn’t know how to handle someone so apparently immune to mockery. So if future leaders attempt to copy Trump’s satire-proof, demagogue style, let’s hope that future comics will have figured out a way to take it down.', 'Dear women of America and men who love women, All week I have received emails, texts and calls from my sisters around the world. They were as diverse as you get – sisters in Congo fighting an epidemic of rape and brutality, and sisters in Iceland striking across the country protesting pay inequity. Sisters in Kenya fighting against genital cutting, and sisters in Iraq building safe houses as fast as women are being taken and enslaved. Again and again there was one panicked question: is it possible that Donald Trump could become president of the United States?\\nThey are all trying to make sense of how a man like this could be on the brink of becoming the most powerful person in the world. A man who has openly admitted and bragged that he can grab women without consent by their genitalia. A man who has now been accused by numerous women of harassment or assault. A man who is fending off a lawsuit from a woman who claimed she was raped by him as a 13-year-old. A man who has an ex-wife who claimed in a divorce deposition that he raped her. A man who appears to project his own sexual predation on fictional Mexican rapists and innocent African American youth. My sisters wanted me to remind American women that this election is our election. Yes, we could have the first woman president. But more importantly this election will determine whether we stand against blatant misogyny, or whether we reward it. It is an election which has unleashed the subculture of sexual violence in America – and that could be our breakthrough, or our breakdown. They reminded me that next Tuesday, we have the power to direct this moment of truth. We as women have such difficulty believing that how we are seen and treated could be the central criteria for judging our candidates. Patriarchy has normalized our suffering, and made us terrified about speaking up. How often do we excuse the most oppressive, denigrating behavior of male leaders, because we believe there is something more important? We as woman often put everything else before ourselves. But this time it should be different. The truth despite the differences between us is that we are 50% of the population of the world. Women do two-thirds of the work of the world but get paid 10% of the income. If we were to start tomorrow refusing to nurse, serve, clean, teach, nanny, mother, organize, create, lead, support, sell, arrange, the world would come to a complete halt. Everything would crumble. There are an endless list of reasons not to vote for Donald Trump. By contrast, Hillary Clinton – for all her real flaws – is a woman who knows what it feels like to be hurt and humiliated by a womanizer. If we choose Trump and not her, all our years of struggle will be for naught. The culture under a Trump will be a Doris Lessing-esque nightmare. I don’t want to spend the next four years using their language, playing in the cesspool of their degradation. I get to determine my own identity. I am done being traumatized.\\nYou don’t have to trust Hillary Clinton. You don’t have to like her. You need to help get her elected and then trust us – trust this covenant of women and loving men, this new army which will have the power joined in our newfound numbers. If, once she has settled in office, Hillary Clinton does not move to implement our collective vision, we will rise and push her ceaselessly at every front. With Trump, there is no front. It’s scorched earth. There is only a hate-filled man and the haters around him, the haters he will grow and give permission to – who have already let us know in no uncertain terms that they will assault, degrade, deny, diminish and destroy us and our rights. If we send Trump back to his gross phallic tower, we will be saying we want these horrifying woman-hating days to be over forever. Defeating him will give us ground to fight the last dirty gasp of the patriarchy which is built on a conviction that subordinated people must stay in their assigned place. So much of the fury that Trump has unleashed is because all too many of us are perceived as breaking the chains of a society built on gender and race hierarchies. I want this to be the moment where all of us who identify as women say what happens to us is the bellwether of the future of life on this planet, and must be heeded. This is our world. I want us to declare we are united and will never elect an assaulting, insulting, disgusting degrading man to lead our nation – and we will ever let another one like him get this far. Their days are over. Our sisters, our women leaders, our young daughters everywhere are looking to us. As one character says in the movie Cloud Atlas: “By each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.” If you only vote for one reason, vote for women, for your daughters and sons and for all people. Vote in solidarity with women across the planet. Rise, sisters. Rise.', 'A highly combustible cocktail of Donald Trump’s volatility and Xi Jinping’s increasingly aggressive and autocratic rule threatens to plunge already precarious US-China relations into a dangerous new era, some of the world’s leading China specialists say in a new report. For the last 18 months a taskforce of prominent China experts, some of whom have dealt with Beijing for more than 50 years, has been formulating a series of recommendations on how the incoming White House should conduct relations with the world’s second largest economy.\\nThe group’s report, which was handed to the White House on Sunday and will be published in Washington DC on Tuesday, says ties between the two nuclear-armed countries could rapidly deteriorate into an economic or even military confrontation if compromise on issues including trade, Taiwan and the South China Sea cannot be found. Winston Lord, a former US ambassador to China and one of the report’s authors, told the Guardian: “I’m not totally despondent. I think we can get through this. But I think right now because of China’s policies and the uncertainties of Trump we are in the most uncertain situation certainly since the Tiananmen Square massacre.” Orville Schell, a veteran China scholar who was one of taskforce’s chairs, said he was fearful about Trump’s apparent inclination to light a bonfire under decades of US policy towards China. “We have a weird situation – and actually an incredibly dangerous one – because Trump is so unpredictable,” he said. “This is America’s Cultural Revolution. Just as Mao overthrew the party establishment and unleashed his red guards, Trump is going after the foreign policy establishment elite and he is unleashing his populism.”\\nEven before his shock election last November, Trump had indicated he would take a far harder line towards what he called “the bad China”. “There are people who wish I wouldn’t refer to China as our enemy. But that’s exactly what they are,” Trump wrote in his bestselling campaign manifesto, Great Again: How To Fix Our Crippled America. To China’s dismay, Trump – who has yet to speak with Xi Jinping since his inauguration – has done little to tone down such rhetoric since his election victory. On television and Twitter he has accused Beijing of militarising the South China Sea, manipulating its currency and hampering attempts to rein in North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un. Trump has also angered Beijing by hinting he could offer greater political recognition to Taiwan, a democratically ruled island that China claims as part of its own territory. The taskforce’s 74-page report describes threats to overturn the US’s decades-old “One China” policy towards Taiwan – under which it does not dispute Beijing’s claim to the island – as “exceedingly dangerous” and possibly the most imminent danger to US-China relations and regional stability. “In China’s universe if you don’t agree on ‘One China’ it’s like being in an evangelical church and having someone scream out: ‘There is no God!’ It’s blasphemy,” said Schell. The report also warns of a gathering storm in the South China Sea, where Trump has accused Beijing of building “a massive fortress” in order to tighten its grip over the strategic waterway through which $4.5tn (£3.4tn) in trade passes each year. It says China’s increasingly assertive actions in the region – which include placing sophisticated weapons systems on artificial islands – coupled with growing domestic nationalism risks setting the US and China on “a dangerous collision course”. Last week Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was reported to have claimed war between the US and China in the South China Sea was inevitable within five to 10 years. Members of Trump’s team have criticised Barack Obama’s “weak” posture in the Asia-Pacific and called for an increased military presence there as part of a “peace through strength” strategy intended to push back against China. However, the report cautions the White House against a “short-sighted” military buildup that it says would further inflame tensions. “If China believes the United States is simply bent on containing it militarily, then Beijing would lose any motivation to moderate its conduct and might instead double down on preparations to fight and win in a showdown,” it says. Schell said there was growing consensus among US academics, politicians and even businesspeople that since the 2008 financial crisis an emboldened China had been insufficiently challenged over protectionist trade practices, increasingly aggressive foreign policy moves and egregious human rights abuses. However, following Trump’s unexpected victory the report’s raison d’être changed. “We had assumed the US government was in a steady, solid state and needed to adjust a little. And suddenly along comes Trump and threatens to rip up the playbook and, weirdly, China began to look a little bit as if it were more in the steady state,” Schell said. Rather than simply a set of policy recommendations, then, the report became a direct appeal to Trump’s administration not to allow relations with Beijing to spiral out of control.\\nLord, who was part of a secret 1971 mission to China with Henry Kissinger that paved the way for the reestablishment of diplomatic relations, said he was alarmed at how in just a few days Trump had “taken a sledgehammer” to longstanding US policy on Asia. He described the president’s decision to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as “a geopolitical and economic disaster for the United States” that would damage Washington’s credibility in the region and boost China’s clout. Trump’s “truly baffling and stupid phone call” with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was also a blow. “Australia is one of our most faithful allies through history, and now in Asia, and if you are worried about the South China Sea … this is not the way to start,” Lord said. Evan Medeiros, Obama’s top adviser on Asia and another of the report’s authors, said he felt “somewhere between uncertain and very worried” about Trump’s plans for US-China ties. He cautioned the Republican against trying to challenge Beijing on such a wide range of issues. “You can’t do everything simultaneously. You can’t pick a fight with China on Taiwan, on trade, on North Korea and the South China Sea at the same time. It simply won’t work. You’ll just end up in a big fight with China that doesn’t produce anything for the United States.”\\nThe report’s authors identified some glimmers of hope. While several virulently anti-China figures had found their way into Trump’s administration, other more moderate voices were also appearing. Schell said the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had made some “reasonably reasonable” remarks about China, and he was also encouraged that Matt Pottinger, a former Marine and Wall Street Journal Beijing correspondent, was expected to become the White House’s chief adviser on Asia. “There’s some interesting people that have been picked and will be picked – there are also some real wackjobs,” he said.', 'Donald Trump could still be issued with an invitation to address parliament during a state visit to the UK after officials revealed that a room in the House of Lords remains an option. A spokesperson told the Guardian that the US president could be asked to speak in a second “prestigious venue” in parliament despite John Bercow’s extraordinary warning on Monday that he would block any Trump speech in Westminster Hall. They pointed to remarks made earlier on Tuesday by the Lord Speaker, who insisted he would keep an “open mind” if a request was made, whatever had been said in the House of Commons. A spokesperson representing Lord Fowler, who is also charged with issuing invitations to speak in parliament, said: “The Royal Gallery might be a possibility. The Royal Gallery is a prestigious venue and has hosted guests in the past including President Reagan.” Bercow can block a speech being made from Westminster Hall, from where President Obama spoke, but he has made clear he has less say over the Royal Gallery. Sources confirmed that Lord Fowler could allow a speech to go ahead there if he decided it was appropriate. It comes as Bercow faces a fierce backlash from Conservative MPs and peers who are calling on him to consider his position as Speaker after he took the unprecedented step of voicing his opposition to Trump.\\nHis comments – that the US president’s “racism and sexism” made him unfit to address parliament – won plaudits from Labour and Scottish National party politicians on Monday who clapped and cheered in the Commons’ chamber. In his statement to peers, Fowler complained that Bercow had not kept him informed of his actions: “I should make it clear that I was not consulted on that decision or its timing.” He added that Bercow had said sorry for not informing him in advance. Fowler said it was not up to a Speaker to make a judgment on whether Trump should visit or not. “My view is that I will keep an open mind and consider any request for Mr Trump to address this parliament if and when it is made,” he said, although he also expressed his own campaigning against prejudice and discrimination, particularly aimed at the LGBT community. In the Commons, Bercow did not apologise when challenged by MP Sir Gerald Howarth about the importance of neutrality. He responded that the decision to bar the US president from Westminster Hall was within the remit of his role and said he was being honest. However, the Guardian understands that at least two Conservative MPs have approached parliamentary clerks to ask how to table a no-confidence motion in the Speaker, even though it would be unlikely to pass.\\nBy Tuesday evening, a number of MPs had accused Bercow of overstepping the mark by actively “snubbing” government foreign policy, which aims to build bridges with the new US administration. Alec Shelbrooke MP said Bercow’s job was to “be a referee not a player”. “His position is untenable because he cannot be deemed to be independent and a Speaker must have the respect from all sides of the house,” he told the Guardian. The MP argued he did not agree with Trump’s comments about women, nor his “heavy-fisted, inexperienced act” of banning travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries. But he said this was not about Trump or Bercow, but about about the neutrality of the position. “His comments undermine government policy,” he added, arguing that Theresa May had chosen to try to influence American policy by engaging with Trump. He also criticised Bercow for a lack of consistency when he said it was an “honour” to welcome the emir of Kuwait – a country Fowler said had questionable policies towards gay people, women and banned Israeli citizens. Others pointed out that the Speaker had appeared happy with China’s president Xi Jinping addressing parliament, despite unrest among MPs about the country’s human rights record. The former culture secretary John Whittingdale said he had been taken aback by the amount of correspondence from people who were “very cross”. “They don’t necessarily sign up to everything Trump says but they don’t like the very public attack on him by somebody who is supposed to be neutral,” he said. The Tory MP argued that Bercow was speaking for Labour and SNP politicians – who applauded and cheered his intervention – but not for Conservatives. “Even if he does have a strong view, the way you do it is to say to Theresa May, privately, ‘Let’s save the embarrassment’. He – by gratuitously making a strong attack – has ruled that impossible.” Even Nadhim Zahawi, an outspoken critic of Trump’s travel ban that may have affected his own family, was angry with the Speaker, warning he had opened himself up to “accusations of partiality and hypocrisy”. Writing in the Guardian, he urged Bercow to reconsider his position. “If we are to make the case to him that it is morally wrong to ban people based on their faith or country of origin, and that his order jeopardises global security, we cannot compromise our ability to do this by banning him from coming to the most famous place of debate and scrutiny in the world,” he said. The issue caused annoyance in Downing Street and across Whitehall, although sources played down the impact it might have on US relations. It is understood that the question of an address to parliament has not come up during recent conversations with key figures in Trump’s administration. One source insisted the US president wanted the pomp and ceremony of a state visit and was uninterested in the “ultimate establishment” act of addressing Westminster politicians.', 'Whatever else you might want to say about the first weeks of the Trump era, one fact is undeniable: we are living in the golden age of hand-lettered signs. History will judge how effective the Women’s March and the airport protests of last week turn out to be, but as protest movements go, I suspect they were unrivalled in terms of genuinely clever one-liners. The signs were everywhere – on Instagram and Twitter and email – cardboard memes designed both for the crowd they were immersed in, and the great teeming after-party of social media. Some were gleefully profane: “This pussy grabs back!”; “now you’ve pissed off grandma”. Some were meta, like the many variations of the “Not normally a sign guy, but geez” placard that first appeared in the weeks after the election. Some found comedic defiance in rewriting the canon of resistance, like the sign that appeared at JFK the night after Trump signed the immigration executive order: “First they came for the Muslims, and I said NOT THIS TIME FASCISTS!”\\nThe signs were only part of a larger story. American liberty, tolerance and the separation of powers may be under fire, but so far, against all odds, laughter is thriving in the Age of Trump. Fittingly for a presidential campaign that, by many accounts, first emerged out of Barack Obama’s roasting of Trump at the White House correspondents’ dinner, comedy has woven a bright and defining thread through the events of the past six months. Make no mistake, these are dark times for the Republic. But they have also been uncommonly funny. I find the persistence of laughter to be heartening, as incongruous as it might seem. Incongruity is one of the fundamental forces in the universe of comedy: take two things that don’t usually belong together; throw them into the same sentence; hilarity ensues. Dark comedy in particular thrives in juxtaposing the solemn, the mortal, with the petty and the prurient. So it makes sense that we should find ourselves reaching for punchlines when we want to throw punches. When things are bleak, we lean on humor to fight back, to build bonds, to whittle away at the pedestals of the powerful. Humor is no substitute for engaged journalism: we still need White House reporters eliciting leaks from within Trump’s inner circle, and Jake Tapper calling out Kellyanne Conway’s lies on CNN. But the jokes have played a defining role in framing the Trump administration, establishing the defining tropes. The master-narrative that seems to be emerging that Trump and his emissaries have an Orwellian relationship to the truth came from the #alternativefacts memes circulating through social media: fake transcripts of Sean Spicer saying preposterous things followed by “Period”; mock remembrances of Conway’s fictitious Bowling Green Massacre. Laughter turns out to be central to the resistance for another reason: the unique cocktail of authoritarian bellicosity and emotional neediness that is Donald Trump. Presidents and presidential candidates have been skewered on Saturday Night Live since Chevy Chase’s bumbling Gerald Ford impression in season one, more than 40 years ago. (Asked a challenging economics question during a debate parody, Chase’s Ford replied, “I’m sorry, but I was told there would be no math on the exam.”) But most politicians easily shrugged off those impersonations, or happily played along with the gag. Trump, on the other hand, clearly finds Alec Baldwin’s take on him to be infuriating; a number of sources confirm that Melissa McCarthy’s savage impression of Sean Spicer has seriously damaged the press secretary in the eyes of his boss. The autocrat can be feared or despised and still maintain his power. But he cannot be ridiculous. The prominence of satire in the age of Trump is surely also a product of the sheer number of satirists now at work. When George W Bush took office in 2001, social media as we know it did not exist, and only two television shows were serving up political humor on a regular basis: Jon Stewart’s Daily Show, which had just gone on the air a few years earlier, and Bill Maher’s Politically Incorrect. Stewart is – tragically – sitting this one out, but he has been replaced by late-night hosts whose material is fixated on mocking Trump at every opportunity: Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, Trevor Noah, John Oliver, Seth Meyers and Maher himself. That deep bench of political comedy may well end up having a more direct impact on politics. In the weeks after Trump’s election, several commentators suggested that the Democrats should seriously consider running their own celebrity for president. (Traditionally, this is a Republican tactic, from Ronald Reagan to Schwarzenegger’s California governorship, to Trump himself.) But even more potent than a mere celebrity would be a celebrity comedian. I suspect one of these days a Stephen Colbert or Samantha Bee will run for national office and prove to be incredibly effective candidates. They will have the celebrity allure of Trump or Reagan, but they will actually be able to think on their feet in the way that a great comedian can, particularly one trained in improv. They will be devastating on the stump and in a debate, and they’ll get votes of that crucial subset of the American electorate that votes purely along celebrity recognition lines. Is it possible that the joke is on us? Gallows humor doesn’t always save you from the gallows, after all. Writing for the New Yorker, Emily Nussbaum observed the way Trump himself ran his campaign events like a Vegas insult comic. “His rallies boiled with rage and laughter, which were hard to tell apart,” she wrote. “You didn’t have to think that Trump himself was funny to see this effect: I found him repulsive, and yet I could hear those comedy rhythms everywhere, from the Rodney Dangerfield ‘I don’t get no respect’ routine to the gleeful insult-comic slams of Don Rickles … to Andrew Dice Clay, whose lighten-up-it’s-a-joke, it’s-not-him-it’s-a-persona brand of misogyny dominated the late nineteen-eighties … where [Trump] still seemed to live.” Nussbaum is certainly correct in her portrait of Trump’s “braggadocious” humor (a favorite non-word of the president’s), and she’s right to find something menacing in that posture. In all the sci-fi imaginings of our dystopian futures, no one anticipated a world where Triumph the Insult Comic Dog wins the presidency and promptly sets up an authoritarian regime. But I suspect that comedy will turn out to be on the side of the angels. Partly this is the nature of jokes themselves. The list of authoritarian comics is a short one. Humor generally comes from the underdogs and outsiders; satire works when you are mocking the powerful; when you yourself have the power, you’re just a bully. (Case in point: Trump’s notorious imitation of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski.) So far, the feedback loop between public mockery and White House reaction is already so tight that Trump opponents have, in recent days, been actively soliciting satire that portrays Trump as the hapless puppet of Steven Bannon, in a deliberate effort to turn Trump against his white nationalist adviser. We are learning, in these early days, that jokes and memes have a role to play not unlike the protest gathering themselves: a way of building solidarity, focusing the general public on the abuses of the administration, applying pressure where the White House is most vulnerable. Not to mention that other intangible benefit of humor in dark times: keeping each other sane. Years ago, the late media scholar Neil Postman wrote a prophetic book about the escapism of the television age called Amusing Ourselves To Death. A bleak future America where a reality TV show personality is elected president would have seemed entirely plausible to Postman. But I suspect he would have been surprised by the nascent power of humor as a form of resistance, the strange new channel that opens up when you combine the scrawled satire of the cardboard signs and the digital 140 characters of Twitter. Facing a regime so vulnerable to satire, and living in age where a well-turned joke can reach millions, the American left may well find itself reversing Postman’s formula, and amusing itself back to life. Wonderland: How play made the modern world is out on 16 February', 'The government has abandoned the idea of Donald Trump addressing the joint Houses of Parliament when he comes to Britain for a state visit later this year after objections by MPs led by the Commons Speaker John Bercow. The US president’s controversial visit is now expected to run from a Thursday to a Sunday in late summer or early autumn, with officials trying to ensure that Trump is not in London at a time when parliament is sitting, in order to avoid a formal snub.\\nAccording to Westminster sources, a weekend visit at the very end of August or in September is now under discussion between the government, Buckingham Palace and the White House. A source described such a plan as “the preferred option at our end”. Parliament will be in summer recess until 5 September and adjourns again for the party conferences on 15 September for nearly a month. Such an arrangement would mean that Trump would not be invited to address parliament at all. The approach follows Bercow’s statement this week that he would not give his consent either to a speech by the president in Westminster Hall or in the royal gallery, both of which have traditionally been used for addresses by visiting statesmen and women. Officials are also said to be keen to limit the president’s public exposure more generally during the visit, in order to reduce the opportunities for protests and disorder on a state occasion. Hundreds of thousands of protesters could be expected in any large city, causing major headaches for the emergency and security services. This suggests that the president will spend relatively little time in London, while the majority of the visit will be conducted behind as strict a security cordon as possible.\\nA further issue that has still to be resolved is the extent to which the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be involved in a visit of which, officially at least, she is the host. The couple, who are both now in their 90s, normally spend late August and September at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire and only rarely return to London during their stay. One possibility is that Trump could be invited to a state banquet at Windsor Castle, rather than at Buckingham Palace. This would be easier to guard against protesters and would cause less disruption, while satisfying the necessary protocols. Trump might be encouraged to spend a significant part of his visit in Scotland, perhaps visiting the Queen at Balmoral rather than in England, and enabling him to visit the Isle of Lewis, where his mother, Mary MacLeod, was born in 1912, before she left for the US as an immigrant. Trump also owns two golf courses in Scotland, Turnberry in Ayrshire and a purpose-built course at Balmedie north of Aberdeen. Any visit to Scotland would raise delicate political issues for the nationalist government in Scotland led by Nicola Sturgeon, which would have to decide whether to boycott Trump or not. Scottish National party MPs at Westminster broke into applause at Bercow’s statement this week, But Scotland’s former first minister Alex Salmond told an LBC radio phone-in this month that he favoured the president coming to Balmoral.\\nInvitations to deliver an address in the royal gallery normally require the Speakers of the Commons and the Lords, currently Bercow and Lord Fowler, to agree, while invitations to Westminster Hall also involve the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Marquess of Cholmondeley. On Monday Bercow made clear he would not support an invitation at either venue, triggering calls from some backbenchers for him to step down. Two of Trump’s modern predecessors as president, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, have addressed the joint houses in the royal gallery. Only Barack Obama, in 2011, has made a speech in the 11th-century Westminster Hall. Even before Bercow’s intervention, government ministers are believed to have concluded that the level of objection among MPs of all parties after Trump’s executive order banning arrivals from seven mainly Muslim countries made a parliamentary invitation too politically hazardous to justify. The leader of the Commons, David Lidington, is said to have reached this conclusion before the Speaker made his own opposition public in the chamber on Monday. A White House spokesperson told the Guardian “we have no further details to share at this time”.', 'Every day is throwback Thursday for the former chief photographer for Barack Obama in the White House, who appears to be attempting to troll Donald Trump on Instagram. Since he created his personal @petesouza account on 21 January, Pete Souza has attracted 800,000 followers on the back of his intimate images taken behind the scenes of the Obama presidency.\\nThe snaps he has selected, and the moments at which he has chosen to post them, have been interpreted by observant Instagrammers as throwing subtle shade at the new president. For instance, late last month, after Trump signed an executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries, Souza shared an image of Obama talking to a Muslim refugee in Kuala Lumpur:\\nWhen Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court, Souza reposted a photo of Obama with his pick, Merrick Garland, who Republicans refused to consider for the role last year:\\nThe same day, as reports emerged that Trump told Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto over the telephone about sending troops south of the border to take care of “bad hombres”, Souza shared a photo of Obama and Peña Nieto enjoying a tequila:\\nAfter Trump’s acrimonious phone call with Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, was reported as evidence of the deteriorating alliance between the two countries, Souza shared a photograph of Obama conversing with Turnbull at the Asean gala dinner in Laos last September:\\nAnd after a report by the New York Times on Sunday of meetings being conducted in the dark because White House aides were unable to find the light switches, Souza shared a photo of Obama conducting a meeting beneath at least five light sources:\\nMore generally, Souza has highlighted the paucity of women in Trump’s cabinet:\\nSouza lists his occupation in his Instagram bio as “TBD” – to be decided. He expands on his website that he “is currently a ‘free agent’, hoping that the Boston Red Sox need a utility player in the coming season”. His previous Instagram posts as chief photographer have been archived to the @petesouza44 account, maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration along with all other digital records of Obama’s time in office.', 'Theresa May has made an impassioned defence of her decision to seek close links with Donald Trump, telling prime minister’s questions that while Labour wanted to “lead a protest” against the US president, she was protecting British interests. The prime minister gave her strongest condemnation yet of Trump’s temporary ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries entering the US, calling it “divisive and wrong”. But questioned repeatedly by Jeremy Corbyn about her slowness and caution in condemning the policy, May insisted Trump’s planned state visit to the UK should go ahead. At times May was openly taunted by the Labour leader, who referred to a letter she had sent him by saying: “I hold in my hand her piece of paper”, a reference to Neville Chamberlain’s disastrous 1938 appeasement of Hitler. But May defended her trip to see Trump last week. “The right honourable gentleman’s foreign policy is to object to and insult the democratically elected head of state of our most important ally,” she told Corbyn. “Let’s just see what he would have achieved last week.” May asked rhetorically if Corbyn would have achieved an exemption for UK citizens from Trump’s travel order, or seen him commit to Nato and to the idea of a trade deal with the UK, bringing mass replies of “No!” from her MPs. She said: “That’s what Labour has to offer this country: less protection for British citizens, less prosperous, less safe. He can lead a protest. I’m leading a country.” Corbyn devoted his entire allocation of questions to Trump and US relations, beginning: “At last week’s prime minister’s question time, the prime minister told the house: ‘I’m not afraid to speak frankly to the president of the United States.’ What happened?” May replied: “I was able to build on the relationship that we have with our most important ally, and to get some very significant commitments from President Trump.” Asked whether she had prior notice of the travel ban, which has prompted protests and condemnation, May said she had not, adding her strongest personal criticism yet of the plan. “On the policy that President Trump has introduced, this government is clear that that policy is wrong,” the prime minister said. “We wouldn’t do it. In six years as home secretary I never introduced such a policy. We believe it is divisive and wrong.” Praising the UK’s record on settling refugees, she added: “The question is how you respond. The job of government is not to chase the headlines. The job of government is not to take to the streets in protest. The job of government is to protect the interests of British citizens. And that’s exactly what we did.” Corbyn asked the prime minister whether access to the NHS for US healthcare firms had been offered up as a “bargaining chip” for a new trade deal. May replied, to cheers from her MPs: “The NHS is not for sale and it never will be.” The Labour leader ended by noting Trump’s travel ban, his stated intention to quit climate change deals, his defence of torture and dubious record on women’s rights. He asked, referring to a petition against the state visit: “Just what more does President Trump have to do before the prime minister will listen to the 1.8 million people who have already called for his state visit invitation to be withdrawn?”', 'Donald Trump will work towards the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency – and any employees cleaving to the Obama era should be “very worried” by the prospect of Scott Pruitt taking over the agency, a key aide of the president has told the Guardian. In an exclusive interview, Myron Ebell – who headed up Trump’s EPA transition team, said that agency’s environmental research, reports and data would not be removed from its website, but climate education material might be changed or “withdrawn”. Ebell also signalled that a review of fuel efficiency standards for cars, rushed through by the departing Obama administration, is likely to be reopened despite its contribution to the US’s pledged emissions cuts in the Paris agreement. A campaign stump pledge by Trump to scrap the EPA in its entirety was “an aspirational goal” that would be best achieved by incremental demolition rather than an executive order, according to Ebell. “To abolish an agency requires not only thought but time because you have to decide what to do with certain functions that Congress has assigned to that agency,” he said. “President Trump said during the campaign that he would like to abolish the EPA or ‘leave a little bit’. It is a goal he has and sometimes it takes a long time to achieve goals. You can’t abolish the EPA by waving a magic wand.” The EPA was created in 1970 to protect human health and the environment, but Trump favours devolving much of its work and responsibilities to US states. Ebell has previously said that two-thirds of the agency’s 15,000 engineers, scientists and researchers could be axed but not that Trump’s campaign pledge of revoking the agency itself was still an objective. Half of the EPA’s $8.2bn (£6.47bn) budget is currently passed on to the states and it was “quite possible” that Trump would initially propose a 10% cut in federal EPA funding, Ebell said. While he does not speak for the president, his dismissals of climate science and environmental regulation have cut with the grain at the new incumbents of the White House. A climate action plan Ebell prepared for the incoming president outlines a strategy for withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, and scrapping Obama’s signature clean power plan. Any attempts to abolish the EPA would likely be steered by Pruitt, Trump’s nominee who has sued the agency 13 times, although Democrats boycotted his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, preventing a vote. The former EPA chief administrator in the Bush White House, Catherine Todd Whitman, complained earlier this week that agency staff were feeling “nervous” about the arrival of Pruitt, a climate science denier who has reportedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fossil fuels industry.\\n“If you want to defend the status quo then you should be very worried,” Ebell said. “I expect Scott Pruitt to be a serious reformer at the EPA.” Fears of a purge of EPA climate data, research, and reports have been fuelled by the removal of climate science material on a White House website and a “temporary hold” placed on new publications until they have been vetted by political appointees. Ebell insisted that existing scientific webpages would be protected. “I have no doubt that they will not disappear,” he said. “I don’t think President Trump has the least interest in destroying or hiding information. But I do think that a great deal of what the EPA puts out in the way of so-called ‘climate education’ – some of the research that they’ve not necessarily done but promoted – does not meet the minimal standards legally required by the federal information quality act. It therefore needs to be changed or withdrawn.” Ebell is the director of the ultra-conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, and the “number one enemy of climate change alarmism”, according to his Twitter page. He has gained notoriety for arguing that climate science is based on “a tissue of improbabilities” and his CEI has been ridiculed by Greenpeace for a video claiming that CO2 is not a pollutant. As he arrived in Brussels to address a Blue-Green summit on Wednesday, he was jeered by scores of environmental protestors, one of whom was bundled out of the meeting after brandishing a placard saying ‘Resist’ during his speech. Ebell has described the environmental movement as “the greatest threat to freedom and prosperity in the modern world.” Asked for his advice to Ebell, Greg Barker, a former climate minister under David Cameron issued a plea: “Please stop trashing experts. “It is incredibly dangerous. We live in a very complex and integrated world and the idea that we should denigrate learning and expertise is very worrying, very dark and sinister,” Lord Barker added. Ebell responded from the podium by accusing Barker of having “strong economic interests in this [environmental] crony capitalist regime”. The combative stance may not have persuaded EU officials in the audience, but it has won admirers on the US “alt-right”, the far-right movement in the US who share his hostility to environmental regulation. In a key speech in North Dakota last May, Trump lashed out at what he said were “totalitarian tactics” by the EPA, as he promised to save the US coal industry, build the Keystone XL pipeline and “cancel” the Paris climate agreement. Doing so would mean “we will be ceding global leadership of climate policy to China,” Ebell said after the meeting. “[But] I want to get rid of global climate policy, so why do I care who is in charge of it? I don’t care. They can take it as far as I’m concerned, and good luck to them.” A green light given to the 54.5 miles a gallon fuel efficiency standard for new automobiles might also be heading for the kerb, after the Obama administration fast-tracked a measure approving the fuel and emissions-saving rule in its last days. Ebell said: “My view is that the mid-term review should be reopened by the Trump administration because I believe the conclusions by the Obama administration were cooked. I don’t think the facts support the conclusion that everything is [proceeding] on target, so I think they will have to reopen that.”', 'François Hollande has led a series of damning attacks on Donald Trump by EU leaders arriving at a summit in Malta to discuss the future of the union. The French president described recent comments by the US president as unacceptable and warned there would be no future for Europe’s relations with the US “if this future isn’t defined in common”. The Austrian chancellor, Christian Kern, said Trump’s ban on travellers from some Muslim-majority countries was “highly problematic”. Dalia Grybauskaitė, the Lithuanian president, offered a withering verdict on the recent meeting between Trump and Theresa May. “I don’t think there is a necessity for a bridge. We communicate with the Americans on Twitter,” she said.\\nThe British prime minister, with the UK’s recently appointed permanent representative to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, by her side, was one of the few leaders not to comment as she entered through the door of the Grand Masters Palace, where the 28 member states are holding talks. Hollande was scornful of Trump’s first days in the Oval office, and warned him to stay out of the EU’s internal affairs. “It cannot be accepted that there is, through a certain number of statements by the president of the United States, pressure on what Europe ought to be or what it should not be,” he said. On Thursday the Guardian revealed that leaders of the parties in the European parliament were seeking to block the expected appointment of Ted Malloch as the US ambassador to the EU following his claim that he intended to “tame” the union. Asked what he thought of EU leaders, like those of Hungary and Poland, who were leaning towards Trump, Hollande said: “Those who want to forge bilateral ties with the US are of course well understood by the public. “But they must understand that there is no future with Trump if it is not a common position. What matters is solidarity at the EU level. We must not imagine some sort of external protection. It exists through the Atlantic alliance, but it cannot be the only possible route, because who knows what the US president really wants, particularly in relation to the Atlantic alliance and burden-sharing? “We in France have a defence policy. We fear nothing … We must have a European conception of our future. If not, there will be – in my opinion – no Europe and not necessarily any way for each of the countries to be able to exert an influence in the world.” The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said he did not feel “threatened” by Trump, but voiced his concern that the US administration was not on top of world affairs. “There is room for explanations because of the impression that the new administration does not know the EU in detail, but in the European Union details matter,” he said. Austria’s leader, Kern, said of Trump’s decision to ban nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries: “We should win these countries as allies in the fight against [radical] Islamism, not as adversaries, and we shouldn’t corner them.” He went on to highlight what he described as America’s “responsibility for the refugee flows through the way it intervened militarily”. Kern said: “It’s not acceptable for the international community if America shirks responsibility. We need to make this clear to our American friends. I’m convinced that there will be a high degree of unanimity [among EU leaders] on this question … The tangible aspects of Trump’s politics are raising some concern.” He added that Trump could be a catalyst for a stronger Europe. Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg’s PM, said it was too soon to draw conclusions on Trump but his were “not the values I’m fighting for in politics”. The European commission’s high representative, Federica Mogherini, said the EU did not “believe in walls and in bans”, and claimed the union would be a reference point for the world. She said: “We are and we will remain friends with the American people and the American administration on the basis of our own strong values, principles and interests.” The European commissioner Günther Oettinger warned the EU not to allow Trump to divide them. “First of all, we must be careful not to accept his game,” Oettinger, a German, told Deutschlandfunk radio. AFP contributed to this report', 'San Francisco filed suit against Donald Trump on Tuesday, becoming the first city to bring a legal challenge against the president’s executive order targeting sanctuary cities. “The president’s executive order is not only unconstitutional, it’s un-American,” said Dennis Herrera, the city attorney. On 25 January, Trump signed an executive order mandating that the federal government withhold grants from localities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement – a practice known as “sanctuary”. The order also directs the attorney general to explore “appropriate enforcement action” against local government agencies following sanctuary policies. Thirty-nine cities, 364 counties and four states have some kind of sanctuary policies in place, according to an analysis by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. Citing the 10th amendment of the US constitution, which delegates powers not granted to the federal government to states and the people, the lawsuit alleges that the order is “a severe invasion of San Francisco’s sovereignty”. The suit also accuses the president of acting “in blatant disregard of the law”. “You’re not an emperor who rules by fiat,” Herrera said at a news conference, describing the message he wants to send to Trump. “Obey the rule of law.” The suit seeks to prevent the federal government from blocking funds to San Francisco. Herrera estimated that the city had about $1.2bn in federal funding at stake. The White House and the US attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Proponents of sanctuary policies, including Herrera and San Francisco’s mayor, Ed Lee, who also attended the press conference, argue that they make cities safer by enabling undocumented immigrants to seek help from law enforcement or local agencies without fear of deportation. A study by the Center for American Progress found that there were on average 35.5 fewer crimes committed per 10,000 people in sanctuary counties than in non-sanctuary counties.\\nSanctuary policies became a major flashpoint in the presidential campaign when a 32-year-old woman, Kathryn Steinle, was randomly shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco. The shooter, Juan Francisco Sanchez-Lopez, had recently been released from a San Francisco jail despite a request from federal immigration authorities, who sought to deport him. Steinle became a key talking point for Trump, who said that her death was “yet another example of why we must secure our border immediately”. On Friday, Miami-Dade County became the first jurisdiction to back down on sanctuary policies, with Mayor Carlos Gimenez announcing that the county would “fully cooperate” with Trump’s order. But other cities around the country have been gearing up for a fight with the Trump administration over immigration policy. It was with that defiant tone that Lee addressed the new lawsuit, saying: “Today, we fight back.”', 'Donald Trump and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, are determined to break up the European Union, and are working to stage exit referendums in Berlin and Paris, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, has said. He claimed Trump represented the third threat to the EU alongside Vladimir Putin and Islamic extremism, adding that the US president’s call to organise the continent of Europe around national identity risked playing with fire. His dramatic remarks at the Chatham House thinktank in London on Monday underline how some Europeans believe Trump represents an existential threat to the EU project and to European values. The former Belgian prime minister and leader of the European liberal group said disaster lay ahead if the continent followed Trump’s call to return to nationalism. Saying the EU faced three threats, he identified the first as “radicalised political Islam that has mounted attacks on European soil”. The second was Putin, “who is trying to undermine the EU from inside with cyber-attacks and financing far-right political parties including [Geert] Wilders in the Netherlands and [Marine] Le Pen in France”. He added: “My impression is we have a third front undermining the EU, and that is Donald Trump, who ... has spoken very favourably that other countries will want to break away from the EU, and that he hoped for a disintegration of the EU.”\\nHe accused Bannon, who previously oversaw Breitbart news, of trying to foment anti-EU feeling in Europe. “He is sending people now to Paris and Berlin to prepare for similar referendums ... as Brexit,” he said. After his speech he pointed to the growth of Breitbart websites in Europe. Verhofstadt, who had just returned from the US, said: “I can tell you that every European I met there had drawn only one conclusion and that is the EU has fewer friends than ever in the US.” He also claimed Trump’s populism was influenced by European populism. “It’s the opposite of what people think – it’s from here first and it went over the Atlantic,” Verhofstadt said. He also warned that Trump’s allies did not understand the dangers posed to Europe by populism and national identities based on ethnicity rather than shared values. “Thirty million people have died because of pogroms and ethnic cleansing in Europe,” he said. “Putting your political thinking and future organisation of Europe on nationalist ideas is the most stupid thing you can do. It’s playing with fire, knowing what it has created in the past.” Although he warned that a breakup of the EU would be a disaster, he said: “It would be ridiculous not to recognise that the EU is involved in multiple crises – security, migration, geopolitical weakness in our neighbourhood and poor economic results in the south of Europe.”\\nBut he said the Brexit negotiations represented “a golden opportunity” for the EU to remake itself, saying there was a new generation of younger, pro-European politicians such as Emmanuel Macron who were willing to defend Europe from attacks by the populist right. On the Brexit talks, he said the critical period was relatively short between Theresa May triggering article 50 and the need for the European parliament to craft a response ahead of the European parliamentary elections in 2019. He also rejected suggestions that the exit part of the negotiations would have to be completed first and conducted independent of the discussion about the UK’s future relationship with the EU. He said that any deal would have to be ratified by the European parliament as well to be legally enacted. If the European parliament does not sign off on the deal, the UK “will exit without any agreement”, Verhofstadt said.', 'The Guardian’s editorial about Donald Trump’s latest illiberal act refers to the poem by Martin Niemöller about the way in which Germans in the 1930s turned a blind eye to Nazi outrages. First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out — Because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — Because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me. In other words, pragmatism played into Hitler’s hands. As the Guardian notes, the reality of what Americans have done in electing Trump as their president “is only beginning to hit home.” Day after day he is signing away human rights with executive orders. The latest is the ban on Syrian refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim nations from entering the United States: “a cruel, stupid and bigoted act, designed to hurt and divide.” The Guardian, with Theresa May’s embarrassing endorsement of Trump’s election in mind, argues that nations proclaiming themselves to be Trump’s ally risk being implicated as supporters of his policies. It asks: “Will anti-Trump Republicans stand up for law, justice and order, or will they bow the knee? Will Democrats mount an effective opposition?” But its main question is aimed at May and her government, scorning her pragmatism: “She has been played for a sucker... She is deceiving herself if she thinks she can control Mr Trump... A line has been crossed in Washington. “The public gets it. Sir Mo [Farah] gets it. The prime minister needs to get it too... Britain must not be, or be seen as, a lackey of possibly the worst leader the US has ever elected.” I may be only one day away from this blog’s demise, but I’m mighty proud of working for the Guardian when I read those words. But what of the rest of the UK national press reaction to Trump’s immigration ban? Here’s the pragmatic Daily Telegraph: “First, Mr Trump is doing something that he promised voters he would do. Before his election, he was entirely open about restricting the entry of Muslims... Second, and more fundamentally, all nations have a right to control their borders.” While conceding that the ban is unlikely to make America safer and the human cost of the ban “is unacceptably high”, the Telegraph applauds May’s response as “the right one.” It concludes: “Mr Trump’s solution to the problems of immigration and extremism is controversial, but that does not mean those problems do not exist.” And here’s the pragmatic Daily Mail: The ban “was a crude stroke by Mr Trump... But brutal as it may be, it should not have come as a surprise.” So how should May, and Britain, react? To bar Trump from Britain “would be an absurd over-reaction and hugely damaging to British interests. “Yes, Mrs May must defend the interests of British citizens and she’s right to disagree with the severity of these measures. But isn’t it better to express these criticisms as a friend rather than an enemy?” And here’s the pragmatic Sun: “Angry keyboard warriors demand the prime minister lectures foreign countries over their democratically elected leaders... Noisy virtue-signallers might prefer that Theresa May had condemned Trump’s ban at the first opportunity, but would it have helped our interests in the long run?... Britain can best serve people of all faiths and nationalities by exerting its influence on the White House to promote greater understanding and acceptance. It won’t win Mrs May many friends on social media, but it would be the actions of a true world power.” And here’s the pragmatic Daily Express: It opposes any suggestion that Trump’s state visit might be cancelled: “There may be issues on which our government will disagree with the new American administration. “But to cut ourselves off from Washington would be absurd and completely unproductive. The effectiveness of continuing dialogue was shown by Mrs May herself at the weekend. “Even those who dislike both the new president and the Tory government had to acknowledge that she handled the occasion with aplomb.” With aplomb? Her cautious neutral statement in Turkey when questioned about Trump’s ban view was shameful. Note also the adjacent article in the Express arguing that Trump has acted sensibly in imposing the ban. The Times, I am sad to report, was also lured into a pragmatist response. It believed the ban would harm genuine refugees and exclude “well-meaning students and employees of American corporations.” There was also an implied criticism of the prime minister for not being “quick to castigate the president in public.” But it excused her being “rightly solicitous of the good impression she made with the Mr Trump on her recent visit” because “she is keen to establish good trading relations.” The Times said May “may also have concluded she can have more impact in private rather than by broadcasting her views through CNN and the BBC. She has... observed that there are more effective means of influencing him [Trump] than jumping on bandwagons.” Really? Where is the proof of that? As for the call for Trump’s proposed state visit to be cancelled, the paper does not wish Britain “to antagonise Mr Trump with mass protests and snubs from politicians.” Clearly, “British interests”, most obviously over trade because of Brexit, are the overriding concern for the pragmatists. The Daily Mirror, at least, was having none of it: “The prime minister should inform the maverick US president that he is not welcome on a state visit, so no banquet with the Queen until he drops the grotesque bigotry. “This crisis is a severe test of May’s pledge to be a ‘candid friend’ after the PM shamefully dodged, three times, criticising a policy that is light on evidence but heavy on prejudice.” Precisely. Principle counts more than pragmatism.', 'Theresa May has secured a commitment from Donald Trump that the US is fully behind Nato at a historic press conference with an uncharacteristically emollient president. May’s wisdom in becoming the first foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House had been questioned, after a series of wayward comments from the president in the run-up to the much anticipated meeting on Friday. But she will hope to claim some credit for persuading him to reaffirm his country’s allegiance to the transatlantic alliance, which he has previously described as “obsolescent”.\\nStanding next to Trump, who nodded along, May said: “On defence and security cooperation, we’re united in our recognition of Nato as the bulwark of our collective defence and we reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance. We’re 100% behind Nato. “I agreed to continue my efforts to persuade my fellow European leaders to deliver on their commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, so that the burden is more fairly shared.” Trump also appeared to moderate his stance on torture, suggesting that while he still believes “enhanced interrogation” works, he would defer to the views of his defence secretary, James Mattiss, who has previously said he does not believe such methods are effective. Referring to Mattis, Trump said: “He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture, waterboarding, or however you want to define it. I don’t necessarily agree, but I can tell you that he will override me, because I’m giving him that power.”\\nDowning Street has sought to toe a difficult line, between Britain’s need to maintain a close relationship with the US as it leaves the EU, and Trump’s unpredictability, as well as the fact that many British voters are sceptical about him. But No 10 was delighted by the gaffe-free press conference, in which Trump displayed unusual calm. Sources said the two leaders felt they had gained something from their dialogue in the Oval Office, which was followed by a working lunch of braised beef short ribs. Trump, who visited Scotland the day after the EU referendum last June, said he had been “scorned” after expressing support for Brexit, adding: “I think Brexit’s going to be a wonderful thing for your country and I think it will be a tremendous asset, not a tremendous liability.” May said she had extended an invitation from the Queen to Trump and his wife Melania to make a state visit to Britain later this year. “I am delighted that the president has accepted that invitation,” she said. The packed press conference was the first of Trump’s presidency with a foreign leader, and at times, he appeared to be choosing his words more carefully than usual. The prime minister met Trump together with her joint chiefs of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, as well as the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch. Trump suggested that the pair had struck up a rapport, calling the prime minister by her first name. “I think I am a people person, and I think you are also, Theresa,” he said. Video footage had earlier shown them briefly holding hands.\\nA restrained Trump opened the press conference by paying tribute to the longstanding ties between the two countries. “The special relationship between our two countries has been one of the great forces for justice and for peace, and by the way, my mother was born in Scotland,” he said. May congratulated the president on his “stunning election victory” and said the fact she was the first foreign leader to meet him was “an indication of the strength and importance of the special relationship that exists between our two countries – a relationship based on the bonds of history, family, kinship and common interests”. The prime minister deliberately drew parallels between her political philosophy and Trump’s, saying: “If you look at the approach that we’re both taking, one of the things we have in common is that we will put the interests of working people right up there, centre stage.” Trump suggested that May would not be the only leader he hoped to strike up a close relationship with. Asked about reports that he is planning to unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia, he said: “We look for a great relationship with all countries – that won’t necessarily happen. “If we can have a great relationship with Russia, with China, with all countries, I’m for that. No guarantees, but if we can, that would be positive.” May firmly restated Britain’s view on Russian sanctions that the deal aimed at securing peace in Ukraine must be honoured first. “We have been very clear that we want to see the Minsk agreement fully implemented. We believe sanctions should continue until we see the Minsk agreement fully implemented,” she said. Trump gave a vigorous response to a question about Mexico, saying previous US presidents had been “beaten to a pulp” in trade negotiations with the country and he would handle future talks more robustly.\\nMay was able to see the bust of Winston Churchill that has been restored to the Oval Office. Barack Obama removed the statue in 2009 and a bizarre row broke out during the referendum campaign last year, in which Boris Johnson suggested that the decision demonstrated Obama’s “ancestral dislike of the British empire”. Obama in turn explained that he had replaced it with a bust of the civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. Trump restored the wartime British prime minister to his former place, a decision May’s camp regarded as symbolic of a closer relationship. May evoked the second world war collaboration of the two countries in her speech on Thursday. Before her Oval Office meeting, she went to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington Cemetery. Downing Street said Trump presented May with a 1865 edition of Harper’s Weekly, depicting Abraham Lincoln’s second inauguration as president, and a handprinted excerpt from his second inaugural address. The first lady, Melania, gave the prime minister silver knot cufflinks for her husband, Philip. The prime minister’s meeting with the president came amid renewed consternation about his ad hoc approach to policymaking. Trump’s spokesman announced a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for the border wall on Thursday, after the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, refused to meet Trump to discuss the issue. However, the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, later suggested this idea was one of “a buffet of options”. Following the press conference, at which both parties sought to talk up their relationship, the Washington Post noted how much things had changed since this time last year, when MPs, including those in May’s Conservative party, lined up to criticise Trump in a debate on whether he should be banned from the UK. On Friday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, criticised the prime minister.\\nAn awkward question After a trying week for Trump, a moment of levity: the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, rose to ask the first question from a member of a British media organisation. Where, she asked, had the two leaders disagreed and what did Trump think about unease across the Atlantic about his support for torture and a ban on Muslim immigration to the US, among other controversial policies. “This was your choice of a question?” Trump responded, turning to the British prime minister. “There goes that relationship.” Kevin Rawlinson', 'Theresa May has been urged to adopt a strictly businesslike stance with Donald Trump when she meets him at the White House on Friday, otherwise she risks creating a fawning relationship with an unpredictable American president that could turn toxic in the way that it did for Tony Blair in the wake of the Iraq war. The advice was given by Stewart Wood, the former overseas adviser to Gordon Brown who, as prime minister, went to great lengths to adopt a transactional approach in his relations with George W Bush in the wake of Blair’s era of intimacy.\\nOther diplomats advised May not to shirk marking out the points of difference during her meeting with the new US president, including over the future of multilateral bodies, such as the United Nations and Nato. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, promised on Thursday that May would be spelling out “in capital letters” how important she regards continuing American support for Nato, an institution described as obsolete by Trump. Johnson said the UK would make the case for the Iran nuclear deal, even though it has been described as horrible by the president. The prospect of a triumphant visit by May underlining the endurance of the “special relationship” has been made more complex by a series of remarks by Trump in the past 48 hours including claims that torture worked and demands that refugees from some Muslim countries should be banned. Lord Wood warned that May had to keep an appropriate distance for her own political survival. “The first pictures of May with Trump will be played over and over in her premiership and, if she is seen to have been too fawning or chummy by his side, it will rebound on her,” he said. “The last thing she needs is a press conference in which he speaks for 30 minutes. It would be a hostage to fortune. “Her demeanour has to be professional and that applies to the style of the meetings, the clothes that are worn and the handshakes. Everything she does has to be seen in the context of protecting the British national interest, rather than in any emotional context or personal chemistry.”\\nA former senior Foreign Office diplomat also issued a warning, saying the prime minister would have to be “very careful given what he has said about torture, refugees, protectionism and withdrawal of funding from the UN, all of which run completely contrary to UK foreign policy. On the other hand, it is axiomatic that every UK premier must have a close relationship with an American president. There is no choice, so it is a very thin line she has to tread. “It looks like Nato, and the commitment to article 5 [which enshrines the principle of collective defence], will be the permitted point of difference and persuasion. In truth, it is quite safe territory since James Mattis and Rex Tillerson [the defence secretary and secretary of state respectively] agree with the UK, and Trump has said some silly things, but they have not gone very far. But she has to be careful how she disagrees.” Other observers, such as the former UK ambassador to Washington Sir Nigel Sheinwald, have recommended that she should base her appeal to Trump about the value of Nato on the shared commercial interest the US has in European security and the extent to which the American and European economies are integrated. An appeal to the pocket and not to the heart may be more persuasive, since Trump is convinced the US has been taken for a ride by its allies.\\nA second foreign office veteran said Trump was “a very instinctual person, and some issues, such as Israel, define whether he is for or against you. So it is important that tone is right”. There are some signs that the Foreign Office is already acting on that advice and shifting its tone, if not its policy, on Israel’s illegal settlements. Johnson, speaking on Thursday, accused the French of staging a pointless Paris conference on the Middle East without Israel or the Palestinians, describing the event as akin to “Hamlet without the Prince.” Johnson acknowledged that the UK was largely in the dark on critical issues such as US plans for cooperation with Russia in Syria. “We need to understand exactly where the White House is coming from,” he said. “We need to understand how they see the end game here and we need to help shape that conversation.” The Foreign Office believes the Trump team is seeking closer relations with Russia over Syria but may not have fully understood the extent to which a deal that keeps Bashar al-Assad in power may end up advancing Iranian interests, not just in Syria but elsewhere in the region. Hostility to Iran is at the beating heart of Trump’s Middle East thinking. Hovering over this analysis remains the assumption that Trump’s thinking can be shaped by foreign leaders and Washington bureaucracies, just as the priorities of a malleable minister can be rearranged by the British civil service. In other words, a version of the normal rules of transatlantic dialogue will be re-imposed. But some diplomats stress that Trump is unlike any previous postwar president and the forces that will ultimately shape his thinking are yet to be discovered. Peter Westmacott, another former UK ambassador to Washington, has been among those to notice the old rules may genuinely have been torn up. “Quite often after the election the winner quickly becomes a bit of a centrist, someone who appeals to all the voters and whose approval rating goes through the roof before their inauguration. We have not seen that. We have seen the continuation of Trump the campaigner.” The worry for the UK will be if Trump just never stops campaigning.', 'Theresa May has said she believed she could a forge a strong personal relationship with Donald Trump, arguing that “sometimes, opposites attract”, as she set out how post-Brexit Britain could work with his country to shape the world.\\nOn the eve of a much-anticipated visit to the Oval Office, the prime minister used a speech to Republican leaders in Philadelphia to pledge that the two countries “have a joint responsibility to lead”, but not as they did before. May argued that a new “special relationship” would be nothing like the one between Tony Blair and George W Bush, which saw the pair collaborate in invading Iraq and Afghanistan. “The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are decisively over.” Despite the growing controversy in the UK and worldwide about Trump’s remarks on the use of torture, as well as a series of other policies including the border wall with Mexico, May said she was determined to “deepen” links. She added: “It is in our interests – those of Britain and America together – to stand strong together to defend our values, our interests and the very ideas in which we believe.” Speaking to journalists on the plane to Philadelphia, the prime minister was asked about the contrast in temperaments between the brash billionaire and a vicar’s daughter, when she meets Trump in the White House on Friday. “Haven’t you ever noticed, sometimes opposites attract?” she replied.\\nHowever, she also signalled that she would be prepared to deliver tough messages to the US president where their views differed, including on torture. On Wednesday, Trump had used his first TV interview as president to say he believed torture “absolutely” works and that the US should “fight fire with fire”. Responding, May said: “We have a very clear view: we condemn the use of torture, and my view on that won’t change, whether I’m talking to you, or talking to president Trump.” She also insisted Britain’s policy on refusing to use intelligence gained through illegal methods remained unchanged. The prime minister has arrived in the US with the Trump administration less than a week old and proving to be more chaotic and unpredictable than any in modern US history. Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, cancelled a scheduled visit to Washington next week to meet Trump, after the US president signed an executive order to move forward on construction of a border wall and repeated his claim that Mexico would be forced to pay for it. May used the wide-ranging foreign policy speech to Republicans to underline the importance of Nato, which Trump has sometimes expressed scepticism about; and of standing up for allies, including those countries in Russia’s sphere of influence. “When it comes to Russia, as so often it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who – during negotiations with his opposite number Mikhail Gorbachev – used to abide by the adage ‘trust but verify’. With President Putin, my advice is to ‘engage but beware’, she warned. She added: “We should build the relationships, systems and processes that make cooperation more likely than conflict – and that, particularly after the illegal annexation of Crimea, give assurance to Russia’s neighbouring states that their security is not in question. We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin’s claim that it is now in his sphere of influence.”\\nThat will be read as a strong message to Trump, who has been accused of being too close to Vladimir Putin, with the FBI even suggesting Russia may have used cyber-warfare in a bid to influence the election result. May also pointed to the need to “reduce Iran’s malign influence in the Middle East” as a key foreign policy priority, saying Britain would “support our allies in the Gulf States to push back against Iran’s aggressive efforts to build an arc of influence from Tehran through to the Mediterranean”. That appeared to be a significant strengthening of language since Britain reopened diplomatic relations with Tehran in 2015. The prime minister also had warm words for Trump’s Republicans, telling them she was speaking, “as dawn breaks on a new era of American renewal”, and addressing them “not just as prime minister of the United Kingdom, but as a fellow Conservative who believes in the same principles that underpin the agenda of your party – the value of liberty, the dignity of work, the principles of nationhood, family, economic prudence, patriotism – and putting power in the hands of the people”.\\nMay’s visit is the culmination of a series of contacts between London and Washington since Trump won the election in November. Her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, met members of his team in December. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson also visited Washington earlier this month to discuss laying the groundwork for a potential bilateral trade deal that the UK hopes could be signed as soon as possible after Brexit. It came as the prime minister faced growing pressure to warn Trump that the British government considers his comments about torture to be unacceptable. Angus Robertson, the SNP’s Westminster leader and a member of parliament’s intelligence and security committee, asked: “How can the UK claim the relationship is special when it potentially involves torture? “Theresa May must raise this with President Trump and explain the extremely damaging consequences that this policy would have on intelligence cooperation between allies.” His comments came alongside similar pleas from Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, his predecessor, Ed Miliband, and the Lib Dems’ Tim Farron. And there were outspoken interventions by Conservatives, including select committee chairs Andrew Tyrie and Sarah Wollaston. Wollaston argued that May’s suggesting the UK and US should “lead together” on a global stage was questionable when Trump was “advocating torture, disgusting racial stereotyping and turning back the clock on women’s rights worldwide”. Trump has suggested he is keen to do a deal with the UK following the Brexit vote, in contrast to his predecessor, Barack Obama, who warned during the referendum campaign that London would be “at the back of the queue”. But sceptics point out that Trump is an avowed protectionist, who has already torn up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal with countries including Japan, and said he wants to put “America first”. In his own speech at the Republicans’ retreat in Philadelphia, Trump joked that with Congress so far refusing to confirm his candidate for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, he would have to discuss trade with May himself. “I don’t have my commerce secretary; they want to talk trade; so I have got to handle it myself,” he said.\\nAsked whether she would be willing to offer US companies access to the NHS as the price of a deal, May said that it was only the “start of the process” of talking about a trade deal but added: “As regards the NHS, we’re very clear as a government that we’re committed to an NHS that is free at the point of use.” Trump, with record-low approval ratings for a new president, has mounted sustained attacks on the press and staged abortive efforts to mend his relationship with the intelligence agencies, while his administration faces congressional and reported intelligence service investigations into the extent of collusion between his campaign and Moscow.', 'Theresa May will pledge to “renew the special relationship for this new age” when she meets with president Donald Trump on Friday.\\nMPs, including some from May’s own Conservative party, have expressed their reservations about May’s visit given Trump’s controversial comments and stances on a range of issues.\\nWe’ve been hearing from our readers on the importance or otherwise of the special relationship.

Disagree vehemently? Share your own views in the comments section below', 'Senior European politicians have suggested Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump on Friday could sour negotiations over Britain’s departure from the European Union. Speaking before the prime minister and new president’s meeting in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon, the French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron claimed that Britain could become subservient to the US.\\n“Britain lived in an equilibrium with Europe,” Macron told France Culture radio. “But now it is becoming a vassal state, meaning it is becoming the junior partner of the United States.” Macron added that he now feared the EU could no longer rank the US as a reliable partner in safeguarding western values. “What’s happening today with Trump’s first statements and choices is extremely serious and worrying,” he said. “It’s firstly a choice that it will be an America that provokes ... an America that destabilises things that have been built for decades. “It signifies that the US will no longer be in a position to co-organise globalisation and be the world’s policeman with the European Union. The unpredictable choices, the outbursts and the inward-looking United States of Trump no longer guarantees Europe’s security.” Meanwhile the European commission’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is understood to have privately expressed concern at the potential for the prime minister’s visit to the Oval Office to further damage relations with EU member states.\\nAny evidence that Britain had started negotiating a deal would be likely to prompt calls for the European commission to investigate, in a move likely to harden attitudes on both sides of the coming article 50 negotiations. A European commission spokesman declined to comment on Barnier’s private views. He repeated the organisation’s official position that the UK is not legally permitted to negotiate on the detail of future trade deals while still under treaty obligations with the EU. One senior source in the commission said: “Like everyone else, we will all be watching.” May’s visit follows a series of contacts between London and Washington since Trump won the election in November. Her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, met members of the new president’s team in December and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, visited Washington this month to discuss a potential bilateral trade deal.\\nOn Thursday, Trump said: “I’m meeting with [May] tomorrow. I don’t have my commerce secretary. They want to talk trade, so I’ll have to handle it myself. Which is OK.” However, asked before a meeting of EU member state finance ministers in Brussels whether May intended to open negotiations with Trump on a trade deal, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, insisted the UK would abide by its obligations to wait until it withdrew from the EU. He said: “Britain remains a fully engaged member of the European Union. I am here today for discussions with my finance minister colleagues. “We will continue to take a full part and we will continue to abide by the rules, the regulations and the laws of the European Union for so long as we are members. So of course we want to strengthen our trade ties with the very many trade partners we have around the world, but we are very mindful of our obligations under the treaty and we will follow them precisely.”', 'Brian Eno has inisisted that “Donald Trump is a complete disaster”. The legendary musician/producer/thinker/renaissance man took to Facebook in the wake of Simon Hattenstone’s interview with him for the Guardian, published on Monday, to clear up any suggestion that he might have been happy about Trump’s presidency.\\nIn that interview, Eno said: “I’ve started to think I’m pleased about Trump and I’m pleased about Brexit because it gives us a kick up the arse and we needed it because we weren’t going to change anything. Just imagine if Hillary Clinton had won and we’d been business as usual, the whole structure she’d inherited, the whole Clinton family myth. I don’t know that’s a future I would particularly want. It just seems that was grinding slowly to a halt, whereas now, with Trump, there’s a chance of a proper crash, and a chance to really rethink.” In a Facebook post, Eno took issue with the headline on the Guardian interview – “We’ve been in decline for 40 years – Trump is a chance to rethink” – saying: “I didn’t use those words in that way (as reading the article would make clear), and they’ve been taken (particularly by some American websites) to suggest that I support Trump. Anybody familiar with my views will know that this is not true. “So, may I make something absolutely clear: I think Donald Trump is a complete disaster. And Brexit is a disaster too. That said, what I think is an even greater disaster is that we in the US and the UK – and increasingly the rest of the world – live inside political systems that can produce absurd results like these.” Eno went on to say that he hoped Trump would “reveal himself for what he really is, and that the public will roundly and unequivocally reject him and everything he stands for – his terrible policies, his jingoism, his arrogance, his childishness, his lies, his prejudices and his small-mindedness. In rejecting Trump we’ll also start to take down the whole malignant media-political structure that so lovingly nurtured him.”', 'Donald Trump still believes the false claim that millions of people voted illegally in last year’s presidential election, the White House confirmed on Tuesday. While some Republicans distanced themselves from the assertion, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by it during Tuesday’s press briefing but was vague on the possibility of an investigation into the supposed crime. Asked if the president believes that millions voted illegally in the election, Spicer replied: “The president does believe that. He has stated that before. I think he stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented him.” On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that he intended to launch a “major investigation into voter fraud”. However, he cited improper voter registration as the focus of the investigation and did not state a desire to review the 2016 presidential election. “I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....,” he wrote in a first tweet, adding in a second: “even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!” The controversy reignited on Monday night when Trump, who won in the electoral college but lost the popular vote, reiterated his view to congressional leaders that millions voted illegally, according to reports. He was criticised by Democrats and some Republicans. But Spicer, who has the unenviable job of publicly defending Trump’s spur-of-the-moment comments and tweets, insisted: “As I said, I think the president has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has.”\\nPressed further, Spicer said it was “a longstanding belief” of Trump’s. “This isn’t the first time you’ve heard this concern of his. I think there have been studies. There was one that came out in 2008 that showed 14% of people who had voted were non-citizens. There are other studies that have been presented to him. It’s a belief that he maintains.” The press secretary appeared to be referring to a Washington Post article by the political scientists Jesse Richman and David Earnest which, drawing on the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, argued that more than 14% of non-citizens in 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. The Washington Post’s website now prefaces the article with three rebuttals, a response from the authors defending their work, and a peer-reviewed article contending that the findings “were biased and that the authors’ data do not provide evidence of non-citizen voting in US elections”. When pressed about whether Trump would call for an investigation into what a reporter said would be the biggest scandal in American electoral history, Spicer said: “Maybe we will.” He later added: “Anything is possible. It’s a hypothetical question.” Asked what it meant for democracy, he was evasive and replied only: “It means I’ve answered your question.” But some members of Trump’s own party were critical on Tuesday and urged the president to stop spreading baseless allegations. Lindsey Graham, senator for South Carolina, said: “I wasn’t there, but if the president of the United States is claiming that 3.5 million people voted illegally, that shakes confidence in our democracy – he needs to disclose why he believes that.” Graham added: “I would urge the president to knock this off; this is the greatest democracy on Earth, we’re the leader of the free world, and people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification. This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it.” The House speaker, Paul Ryan, also distanced himself from the comments. “I have no way of backing that up,” he said. “It doesn’t matter to me. He won the election.” But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told reporters: “The notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true … It does occur, there are always arguments on both sides about how much and how frequent and all the rest, but most states have done a better job on this front.”\\nColorado Republican Cory Gardner, who said this weekend that he had written in Mike Pence’s name in lieu of Trump when voting, said there was voter fraud in the US. When pressed about whether more than 3m illegal votes had been cast, the first-term senator simply said: “I haven’t seen any evidence of that.” Other Republicans simply punted. When asked about Trump’s comments on Tuesday morning, before the Spicer press conference, the Arizona senator John McCain said: “Long ago I gave up talking about what the president talks about; my concern is what he does.” In contrast, Democrats slammed the president’s statement. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “The president ought to realise he is president. Instead of talking about the election or how many people showed up at the inauguration, he ought to talk about how many jobs he created.” Schumer went on to cast blame on elected Republican senators for not condemning these comments: “When these falsehoods are told, our Republican colleagues have an obligation to reject them, not to skirt around them. The bottom line is simple: you cannot run a government, you cannot help people, you cannot keep America safe, if you cannot admit to the facts, plain and simple.” The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders simply said the president’s accusation of voter fraud was a “delusional statement”. Weeks after the election, Trump insisted in a tweet that he had won the popular vote “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally”. Fact-checking websites and newspapers traced the claim to a two-week-old “random tweet” by a former Republican party official in Texas. Gregg Phillips claimed on 12 November to have found “more than three million votes cast by non-citizens” – but he too failed to provide evidence. The topic was one Trump long harped on throughout the campaign with claims that the election was “rigged”.\\nIn October, he insisted at a Wisconsin rally: “People who died 10 years ago are still voting.” Trump specifically claimed 1.8 million dead people would vote – and for “somebody else”. This appeared to be a reference to a 2012 study that found up to 1.8 million active voter registrations from deceased voters. That specific study did not provide any evidence of voter fraud or any ballots cast by the deceased. Instead, it simply illustrated that some state voter databases were out of date. Trump had also long specifically warned of voter fraud in minority communities, specifically in Philadelphia, where Barack Obama won African American neighborhoods by overwhelming majorities in 2012. In an October rally in exurban central Pennsylvania, Trump warned the almost entirely white crowd: “Watch your polling booths, because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania, certain areas. We can’t lose an election because – you know what I am talking about.” There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Research over the last 16 years has found voter fraud to be extremely uncommon, and 2016 appeared to follow that pattern. ProPublica election monitors saw no evidence of widespread illegal voting.', 'Donald Trump promised to do a lot of things on day one of his presidency. Instead, he spent his first full day in office at the CIA, trying to impress a roomful of intelligence officers by bragging about how many Time magazine covers he’s been on. “Is Donald Trump an intellectual? Trust me, I’m, like, a smart person,” he told them, which suggests he thinks the word “intelligence” in the government context means “really smart”.\\nWhen he finally got down to business, though, he showed he does know a few things, like how he got to where he is and what he needs to do to stay there. He may not have fulfilled the vast majority of those “day one, first hour” campaign pledges (deport 2 million “criminal aliens”, introduce congressional term limits, get rid of gun-free school zones), but the ones he did fulfill demonstrated he’s smart enough to understand what’s really important to his supporters, and to his party, even if they’re not always the same thing. So two of his first executive orders broke with Republican party orthodoxy and trashed a pair of trade deals, the TPP and Nafta. Free trade deals are popular in principle with economists, unpopular in practice with pretty much everyone else. So it’s an easy political calculation, yet one that’s eluded Republicans and most Democrats since the Clinton era. Bashing free trade may be hard for some of the GOP’s ideological purists to swallow, but the promise of a permanent Republican majority in the midwest makes it go down a lot easier, and all the more so by the fact that neither executive order actually does anything. Like any good con artist or semiotics philosopher, Trump gets the importance of symbolism over substance. His TPP order “withdraws” from a treaty that was never ratified by Congress in the first place. His Nafta order simply states his intention to renegotiate the treaty at some future date. A third executive order does the same to Obamacare, reasserting Trump’s plan to dismantle it but doing effectively nothing. “Something incredibly cryptic that nobody understands” was how one former Republican Senate aide described the executive order, which sounds a lot like how Republicans talk about Obamacare. In fact, the brilliance of the orders is in their vagueness, allowing Trump to take credit for his opposition to unpopular laws without having to bear any of the costs: the messy task of actually taking away people’s health insurance will, after all, be left to Congress. Similarly, another of his executive orders freezes hiring for a federal workforce that has already been effectively frozen for decades. The total size of the federal workforce today – 2.8 million – is the same as it was at the beginning of the Obama administration, and well below what it was under Ronald Reagan (3.15 million). As a percentage of the total workforce, the federal workforce has been shrinking steadily since the mid-20th century and is now down from 7% to under 2%, as Doug Henwood notes, lower than what it was when Obama took office. Several offices have been under hiring freezes for years, including the Social Security Administration and immigration courts. Hiring freezes play well politically but provide little in value to taxpayers. All they do is accelerate outsourcing to private government contractors whose gleaming offices dot the northern Virginia landscape. They do the same work at twice the cost to taxpayers, often by the very same ex-federal employees wooed away by cushier, private sector salaries. Bashing federal workers is one thing both parties can always agree on; both Jimmy Carter and Reagan implemented hiring freezes as president. It lets politicians play to the anti-government crowd while lining their pockets with contributions from those contractors who rely on their budgetary largesse. These orders won’t do any good for the ordinary Americans Trump champions. They’ll raise their mortgages and healthcare premiums, and funnel more of their taxes to a small gang of politically connected beltway bandits. But they offer a cheap way to sell Trump’s unique brand of populist nationalism to a still skeptical Republican party. They allow him to play to his base without actually doing anything. And they give him some very real benefits to dangle in front of Republicans and their funders, who will be happy to stomach a few empty protectionist gestures in exchange for the opportunity to drain the swamp right into their pocketbooks.', 'Actor Jack Black has compared President Donald Trump to Hot Shots star Charlie Sheen “when he was on crack”.\\nBlack was speaking to Variety magazine at the Sundance film festival as his latest film, scam comedy The Polka King, was receiving its world premiere. Black and his fellow film-makers had been asked for their thoughts on Trump’s rise to the presidency and Black responded with an extended digression on Trump’s “obsession” with winning. He said: “We’ve got to start thinking globally. We’re going to be working together … if the human race, if this species is going to survive. Yeah, America first is fine, in terms of finances, but we’ve got to stop thinking that way. It’s not a Monopoly game where the rich billionaire wins the game. It’s about the world working together, and it’s got to happen soon.” Fellow Polka King cast member Willie Garson then added: “This whole concept of winning, what do you mean winning? At the expense of what? Winning, implied, is someone losing … this is insanity.” Black continued: “Who else has been talking about winning obsessively lately? Oh yeah. Charlie Sheen. When he was on crack.” “Where are we where the president and Charlie Sheen are on the same exact page?” The Sundance film festival runs until 29 January.', 'Jean Seaton: The seeds were sown during the George W Bush era\\nReading George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four again, now, hurts. And I’m not the only one to be revisiting it: sales of the book have soared in the past week. What you had previously thought you read at a cool, intellectual distance (a great book about “over there”, somewhere in the past or future) now feels intimate, bitter and shocking. Orwell is writing of now when he writes, “Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller.” Of course, we all have to keep our heads (especially we have to keep our heads). The lies about the crowd size at Donald Trump’s inauguration by the hapless White House spokesman Sean Spicer at his first briefing were not earth-shattering. But any lie from this podium is deeply unsettling. Any hopes that Trump or his team were, underneath it all, “normal” rightwingers, have dissipated. The post-truth era certainly shares aspects of the dystopian world of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Michael Gove’s infamous comment that Britain has had enough of experts is just one step away from 2+2 = 5. In the interrogation scene in 1984 this is the most appalling moment: before now we read it as a ludicrous indictment of the rejection of reality (surely, we conclude, the party itself must know that 2+2 = 4; science, machines all depend on it). In Nineteen Eighty-Four, the elite, personified by O’Brien, foster and control this willingness to believe one thing one day, and one thing another. Now, it seems, the party itself may believe the lie. As Orwell writes: “Science, in the old sense, had almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for science.”\\nThen there is privacy – Orwell puts the diary and the private self at the heart of his writing. In 1984, keeping a diary is Winston’s first act of transgression. Orwell knew that authoritarian regimes want the heart and soul of people. His two-way telescreens predict social media. And we have, perhaps unwittingly, wandered into a world where feelings have never been more easily swayed: Trump summons them up personally and directly. In the book, Winston is suddenly struck that his mother’s death, “had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible … She had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable.” It could no longer happen because “there were fear, hatred and pain but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows”. But this new world has been a while coming. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway’s “alternative facts” were foreshadowed by the George W Bush adviser who said in 2002 that the new American empire was “creating [its] own reality”. As in the 1930s, war has been at the heart of the corrosion of trust in politicians. The lies over Iraq and the quagmire of Afghanistan were followed by the financial crash of 2008, and bankers’ bonuses – making people far more willing to disbelieve the remote metropolitan media and be drawn to the false dawn promised by Trump. Yet these are the obvious big lies. There has been a long drift away from rational beliefs that we have watched too passively. Mistrust in facts was sown by the insistence on creationism and climate change denial by politicians and in many US churches. But it’s not just America – in India, government officials say that cows don’t contribute to global warming because they breathe out oxygen. Even universities with their “no platforms” have added yeast to the brew. Trump is not O’Brien. He is more like a cut-price version of Big Brother himself. Instead of the elite of Nineteen Eighty-Four, who keep Big Brother’s identity a mystery while they keep total control, this Big Brother, with his direct Twitter relationship with his followers, is fully on show. And as Orwell foresaw, his slogan could be “Ignorance is strength”. Tim Crook: Trump takes doublethink to a new extreme\\nTrump’s first few days of office have been such an explosion of propagandist grapeshot, it’s little wonder many people have been reaching for copies of Nineteen Eighty-Four. His seminal essay Politics and the English Language should also go on the emergency reading list. Orwell said political language can be “designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind”. Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote that this week’s reference by Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway to “alternative facts” means we have “come full Orwell”. But have we? Orwell certainly would have appreciated how the eruption of populist demagoguery and the Brexit and Trump triumphs have generated a “post-truth” anxiety in the mainstream media. Journalism’s key institutions sense a crisis. Public sphere news and current affairs interpretation is supposed to represent reality to the audience. Orwell said that “realism” used to be called dishonesty, and wrote in his account of the Spanish civil war, Homage to Catalonia, that bombs are impartial because they killed the man they were thrown at, and the man who threw them.\\nOrwell never set foot in America. But he was an avid critic of its literature and politics, and would have conceded that his attitude to the USA had elements of the very doublethink he dramatised in Nineteen Eighty-Four. While he resented how post-second world war US economic dominance frustrated the realisation of the British socialist dream, he chose the American side against the Soviet Union in the cold war. After his death, his crystal-pane deconstruction of the corruption of revolution and the totalitarian game were adopted as propagandist weapons by the CIA against the Soviet Union. The early transfer of Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four to film was even financed by the CIA with the endings changed. But Trump takes doublethink to a new extreme, and if Orwell were alive today, I imagine Trump would amuse and horrify him at the same time. The key message in Nineteen Eighty-Four is that the purpose of propaganda is to narrow and limit human consciousness, confuse human conscience, and control and narrow the range of thinking. As all students of Orwellian literature will recall, Squealer, the propagandist porker in Animal Farm, can “turn black into white” and is expert in “new belief”. If any Orwellian unmasking of Trump rhetoric begins to hurt him, I imagine the day will come when the president gestures with his characteristic shape-and-pinch hand movement and bellows, “Fake Orwell”. DJ Taylor: The parallels are impossible to deny\\nIt is just possible to feel a shred of sympathy with Kellyanne Conway. Stung by incontrovertible evidence that more people were keener on complaining about her boss than supporting him, took refuge in a form of words that would have been hilarious were they not at the same time horribly sinister. But it would be wrong to judge her too harshly for her defence of Sean Spicer’s “alternative facts”. She is a PR, operating in a world where all values are expedient. It’s useless to pretend that this isn’t all sharply reminiscent of the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four (by coincidence, Orwell died 67 years ago to the day that the anti-Trumpites marched on Washington). Winston Smith, sitting in his cubby-hole at the Ministry of Truth falsifying back-numbers of the Times in accordance with the latest revisionist diktats from on high, deals in “alternative facts”, or rather with deliberate untruths that eventually become facts merely because the former versions of them are no longer around to disturb. The same goes for the periodic “readjustments” (ie reductions) of the amount of rationed goods available to the cowed citizenry of Orwell’s Oceania. There, the impact of cuts can always be reduced by altering the words of the previous announcement. Inevitably, much of this manipulation can be traced back to Orwell’s monitoring of the concealments and evasions of the second world war – the Katyn massacre, for example, when thousands of Poles were murdered by Soviet secret police and which some Russian history books omit altogether – but its roots lie in his experience of fighting against Franco in the Spanish civil war. It was here, he later wrote, that he first read newspaper accounts of battles that had not taken place and heard reports of soldiers charged with cowardice whom he knew had fought bravely.\\nNone of which should obscure the fact that this defender of objective truth was also a propagandist (working for the BBC’s Eastern Service in the early 1940s, Orwell once complained that the fault of the government’s war-time propaganda was that it needed to do its job more effectively.) At the same time, he was confident that there were lines which neither right nor left in western democracies would cross. The Daily Telegraph, for instance, features near the top of a list he once compiled of newspapers which were reliable. He might not have agreed with the way it interpreted the news, but he believed the information it contained was accurate. As for what Orwell might have thought of President Trump and his entourage, he would probably have drawn attention to the steady war of attrition fought by various political and corporate oligarchies over the past 50 years against the idea that it can be said that a particular event definitely happened, whether you approve of it or not. He might have pointed out, too, that these obfuscations are not merely a byproduct of total war – who could really complain about the RAF rigging the numbers of Nazi planes brought down in the Battle of Britain? – but part and parcel of the way in which a certain kind of contemporary autocrat and reality-twister faces up to the world. Meanwhile, it is worth asking what the average person is supposed to do in a landscape where the leader of what used to be called the free world has such a wanton disregard for one of the principal tools of freedom. Even Big Brother, after all, brought a certain amount of guile to pretending what he said was true.', 'Donald Trump has resigned as a director of his four Scottish golf and tourism firms, raising fresh questions about the US president’s business interests. Filings at Companies House, the UK government agency that holds and publishes documents on all British businesses, show Trump resigned as a director of the four companies on 19 January, the day before his inauguration. However, no filings show any change to Trump’s ultimate ownership of the businesses, which centre on his two golf resorts in Aberdeenshire and Ayrshire and have an estimated investment value of more than £180m. According to the documents, the president has resigned as a director for Trump International Golf Club Scotland, which owns the course and boutique hotel that Trump opened north of Aberdeen in 2012. He has also resigned as director of two firms which own the Trump Turnberry resort in Ayrshire – SLC Turnberry and its parent company Golf Recreation Scotland. The fourth company is DT Connect Europe, which owns the Sikorsky helicopter that Trump brought from Florida in 2014 to transport his family between their two Scottish courses and to service wealthy golfers flying in to Prestwick airport, north of Turnberry. Trump pledged earlier in January to resign directorships in all his companies in an effort to satisfy intense criticism from White House ethics experts about the risks of conflicts of interest between his business interests and his presidency. Trump said day-to-day control of the Trump Organisation’s businesses would pass to his sons Eric and Donald Jr and a company executive, Allen Weisselberg, who would run them in a trust.\\nThe change in directorships appears to leave Eric Trump as the most dominant family member in Scotland. He is now the sole director of Golf Recreation Scotland, which has Trump Turnberry as its registered business address. But Democrat and Republican ethics experts have been scathing about Trump’s divestment strategy since he has failed to sell his shares and holdings, nor has he put them in a blind trust, which means he will continue to be a direct beneficiary of their profits or future sale. Company records seen for Trump International Golf Club Scotland in Aberdeenshire, the loss-making course into which the president has sunk £40m, show that 999 of its 1,000 shares were held directly by Trump in September 2015 – the most recent filing detailing the business’s share ownership. The latest company report discloses that the resort can only survive with Trump’s money. The club’s executives said the resort’s expansion plans, potentially including a major new private housing estate, were not affected by Trump’s pledge to drop all new or pending overseas investments, since they were simply “future phasing” of an existing property.\\nExecutives at Turnberry, home to one of the UK’s most famous Open golf venues and a five-star hotel Trump bought for £34m in 2014, say the business has been booming since Trump ploughed more than £100m in the course’s overhaul and the hotel’s refurbishment. After years recording heavy losses, a Turnberry executive told the Guardian this month the business was on course to make the largest profit in its 100-year history. Its prosperity had been buoyed by the soaring value of the US dollar against the pound after the UK vote to leave the EU resulted in a sharp fall in sterling’s value, boosting visits by American golfers. Andy Wightman, a Scottish Green party MSP and land ownership expert who has studied Trump’s Aberdeenshire business, said there were clear risks of a conflict of interest for Trump, particularly during the negotiations over a future US-UK trade deal. “It is clear that by retaining ownership of 99.9% of Trump International Golf Club Scotland, President Trump is in ultimate control of this company and his efforts to secure a trade deal with the UK are compromised by his continued business interests in the UK,” Wightman said. Trump’s ownership of the companies is complex, leading in Turnberry’s case to the US state of Delaware, which has very loose company reporting regulations but offers substantial tax advantages. Other than the president’s resignation as director, Companies House filings show no recent change in their UK ownership or shareholdings. The latest accounts for SLC Turnberry say its parent company is Golf Recreation Scotland, whose “parent undertaking” is the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, which is registered in New York. It adds that “the ultimate controlling party is Mr Donald J Trump”. However, the latest annual return for Golf Recreation Scotland shows that as of February 2016, its 1m shares are held by a Delaware-registered limited liability company called Turnberry Scotland LLC. A Wall Street Journal investigation in December found that at least half – roughly $304m – of the revenues Trump declared in his federal financial disclosure were held in 96 LLCs registered in Delaware. Those included his famous residence and club at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, and his skyscraper at 40 Wall Street in New York, a fairground carousel that operates in Central Park, New York, as well as the Sikorsky helicopter based in the UK. The shareholdings in many of these companies were interlinked; the WSJ said the opacity and complexity of Trump’s myriad holdings made it far harder to gauge the full extent of any potential conflicts of interest the president would face.', 'To fulfil his campaign slogan of “make America great again”, Donald Trump must back the boom in green technology – that was the message from the leading climate figures ahead of his inauguration as president on Friday. Unleashing US innovation on the trillion-dollar clean technology market will create good US jobs, stimulate its economy, maintain the US’s political leadership around the globe and, not least, make the world a safer place by tackling climate change, the experts told the Guardian. The omens are not encouraging. Trump has called global warming a hoax and is filling his administration with climate change deniers and oil barons. But reversing action on climate change and championing fossil fuels will only “make China great again”, said one top advisor.\\nHere are the messages to Trump from some of the key figures the Guardian contacted. Michael Liebreich, founder of analyst firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance and who has advised the UN and World Economic Forum on energy: If I had one minute with president elect Trump my message would be that the best way to ‘Make America great again’ is by owning the clean energy, transportation and infrastructure technologies of the future. Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation. Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and who has advised Angela Merkel, the Pope and the EU: “Mr President, if you want to make China great again, you have to stay the course you have promised. I think it would be the end of US domination in innovation, in economics. If you try to take the US backwards to the days of mountain top removal [for coal] in West Virginia and all those things, then you will just make sure China becomes No 1 in all respects. In the end, you would produce precisely what you promised to avoid to your electorate.” Prof Dame Julia King, an eminent engineer and one of the UK government’s official advisers at the Committee on Climate Change: If President Trump wants to deliver greater job security for Americans, he should focus on clean and sustainable industries where the US has a competitive advantage. Those are the sectors that are set to prosper. He needs to build an economy for 2050, not one for 1950.\\nLeading climate change economist, Lord Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics: If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense, In the longer term, the low carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth. Mark Campanale: founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative thinktank: If you’re interested in quality, high paying and skilled jobs for the American middle classes, then renewable energy has to absolutely be the place to look. It’s a sector with more employees now than in the US coal industry and with a long way to grow. Prof James Hansen, adjunct research scientist of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, and ‘father of climate change awareness’: “If [Trump] wants to achieve the things that he claimed he would: improving the situation of the common man, the best way he could do this would be a programme of a rising carbon fee with the money distributed to the public.” Jennifer Morgan, co-executive director of Greenpeace International [Mr Trump] you might not realise it yet, but your action, or inaction, on climate will define your legacy as president. The renewable energy transformation is unstoppable and, if the US chooses to turn its back on the future, it will miss out on all the opportunities it brings in terms of jobs, investment and technology advances. China, India and others are racing ahead to be the global clean energy superpowers and surely the US, led by a businessman, does not want to be left behind. Alden Meyer, at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US: Trump’s stance threatens to diminish America’s standing in the world and to weaken the ability of US companies and workers to compete in the rapidly growing global market for clean energy technologies. May Boeve, head of climate campaign group 350.org: Quit. But if you have to stick around, realise that the clean energy economy is the greatest, biggest job creator in history.\\nSome leading figures, who will have to deal directly with the Trump administration, chose more diplomatic messages to the new president, while emphasising the vital need to act on global warming: Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – the UN’s climate chief I look forward to working with your new administration to make the world a better place for the people of the US and for peoples everywhere in this very special world. Scientist Derek Arndt, at Noaa, presenting the temperature data showing 2016 was the hottest year on record: “We present this assessment for the benefit of the American people.”', 'Donald Trump may have thrown fuel on to his feud with the Central Intelligence Agency, through what he apparently intended as a peace offering.\\nTraveling to CIA headquarters in Virginia in what the White House pointed out was Trump’s first official act in office, Trump stood before the agency’s memorial to its dead officers and delivered an often self-referential and highly political speech that included an untruthful claim that his inauguration was better attended than those of Barack Obama. Trump vowed “a thousand percent” support for an intelligence corps he has repeatedly and publicly insulted – including recently likening intelligence officials to “Nazi Germany” – and suggested they would have an open checkbook in his White House. Any feud between himself and the agency was the result of a dishonest press corps, the president astonished some by saying. The speech’s tone, contrasting with the solemnity typically shown to the CIA memorial, prompted the just-retired director of the agency to proclaim his disgust. Through a spokesman, John Brennan proclaimed himself “deeply saddened and angered at Trump’s despicable display of self-aggrandizement”. The three-decade agency veteran added: “Trump should be ashamed of himself.” Trump’s associates are under a counterintelligence investigation to determine the nature of their ties with Russia, an inquiry that includes the CIA. Brennan participated in an assessment that found Russia interfered in the 2016 election for Trump’s benefit. Beginning in December, Trump rejected the CIA assessment, claiming it was produced by “the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction”. In January, ahead of meeting with the outgoing intelligence leadership, he told the New York Times the focus on Russian intrusions in the election was a “political witch-hunt”. While he struck a conciliatory tone after that meeting, he wrongly accused the agency of leaking an incendiary and unverified dossier filled with rumored ties to Russia that multiple news organizations had long possessed. Trump went so far as to liken the agency to Nazi Germany, a statement that astonished intelligence veterans. Brennan recently told the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s comparison was “very repugnant” and crossed “the line”. Yet at Langley on Saturday, Trump said nothing at all about the Russia assessment, and insisted that the “dishonest” media had invented a dispute with the intelligence community that he persistently and publicly waged. The CIA crowd applauded Trump’s derisive comments about the press. “They made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence agencies. It is exactly the opposite,” Trump said, adding: “I love you, I respect you, there is nobody I respect more.”\\nTrump suggested that “sometimes you haven’t always gotten the backing” from the White House, suggesting Obama had “restrained” the agency, and said to laughter and applause: “You’re going to say, ‘Please don’t give us so much backing.’” The reference to “restraint” appeared to be a reference to Obama ending the CIA’s post-9/11 torture program, something Trump has repeatedly endorsed restarting and about which his pick to run the CIA has sent mixed messages. Mike Pompeo, whose nomination vote Democrats in the Senate delayed until Monday, had testified on 10 January that he would “absolutely not” return the CIA to torture, frequently pledging to follow laws that prohibit interrogation techniques not approved by the army’s interrogations field manual. But in written questions subsequently provided to the Senate intelligence committee on 18 January, Pompeo said he will in office “consult with experts at the Agency and at other organizations in the US government on whether the Army Field Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country or whether any rewrite of the Army Field Manual is needed”. Pompeo pledged to inform the committee of any changes to the law he would seek, and continued: “If experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country, I would want to understand such impediments and whether any recommendations were appropriate for changing current law.” At Langley, Trump said Pompeo was a “total star, a total gem” and revealed that Pompeo was the only candidate he vetted for the CIA directorship, one of the most powerful positions in the US government. After meeting Pompeo, Trump said, he cancelled interviews with eight unnamed alternative candidates.\\nSuggesting he would provide the CIA greater latitude than under Obama, Trump said it would be “one of the most important groups” in combatting Islamic State and what he called “radical Islamic terrorism”.\\nTrump also reiterated a campaign utterance about stealing Iraq’s oil and mused: “Maybe we’ll have another chance.” He went on to discuss the crowds attending his events, said he felt “35 or 39” again, and boasted of being on more Time Magazine covers than the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Adam Schiff, the chief Democrat on the House intelligence committee, sounded incredulous over Trump’s speech, particularly over the president’s use of the agency memorial “as a backdrop”. “While standing in front of the stars representing CIA personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country – hallowed ground – Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice,” Schiff said in a statement. “Instead he argued at length about the size of the crowd at his inauguration, set out his favorites in the media, meandered through a variety of other topics unrelated to intelligence, and made the astounding claim so belied by the evidence – ‘I love honesty.”', 'The news in clues Despite everything, the worst fears of the Guardian’s Vlad ... 11ac Prospect of this isn’t half depressing — could be better!

Swaggering into power on the steps of Washington’s Capitol building, Donald Trump turned his back on grace, good manners, common sense, national healing and consensual politics – and opted for division. Spurning a unique opportunity to bind the nation’s wounds – his inauguration as 45th US president – Trump chose instead to reiterate the resentful, grievance-packed messages of his election campaign. This dreadful, chilling performance, excruciating in its banality and bile, has presented the three-quarters of US adults who did not vote for him with an urgent dilemma: how to head off “American carnage”, to use Trump’s unhappy words. To paraphrase the 35th president, John Kennedy, in his inaugural address in 1961: “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do to save your country from Donald Trump.” The task will be a supremely challenging one, for Trump is as bullishly self-confident as he is ignorant. He will not be easily deflected or denied. And the crass, know-nothing nationalism that lay at the heart of Friday’s speech is a powerful force. Like America’s new leader, it appeals to the darker side of human nature, bolstering the insidious claims of jealousy, envy, greed and hubris. It thrives on fear, chauvinism, discrimination and not always subliminal notions of ethnic, racial and moral superiority. It is a product of our times. But it is not too much to say Trump’s ranting scream of “America first, America first!” carries an echo of the “Sieg Heil” (hail victory) of another, not-forgotten era of brutish nationalist triumphalism. For Americans, the extent of the challenge is already clear, the gauntlet has been thrown down. Trump withheld any word of thanks for the considerable work of his predecessor, Barack Obama, over the past eight years, a churlish omission perhaps unprecedented in the history of the American republic. When it came to the substance of his speech, common sense was as lacking as common courtesy. Trump does not have an original thought in his head. He only seems able to speak in slogans, in the same way he only writes in Twitter-length soundbites.\\nHis promise of lasting damage was far reaching and frightening. Trump excoriated both Republican and Democratic leaders, even as they stood politely applauding. His contempt for “Washington DC” and all its works, including the elected Congress and the federal bureaucracy, was as startling as it was undeserved. It was, at bottom, profoundly anti-democratic. And it was a foretaste of serious ructions to come. His vow to rebuild moribund industries and work solely in the interests of the country’s “forgotten people” was as simplistic as it was specious. Trump simply cannot deliver much of what he pledges. That may yet prove to be his mortal weakness. In the meantime, he will do much harm trying to get his way.\\nNow as before, Trump’s perceptions are skewed by anger and fear. Obsessive resentment over the way foreigners have supposedly exploited America’s good nature spills out of him like poison. But as always, answers are lacking. If he offers any remedy at all, it is unabashed protectionism, both physical and economic. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength... America will start winning again, winning like never before,” he said. Those words will echo around the world, from the hi-tech corridors of southern China to the developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa. They also plunge a blunt knife into Theresa May’s hopes of a post-Brexit sweetheart trade deal. Trump’s first executive actions gave a further indication of the scale of the battle America now faces. Obamacare, the landmark reform for which the former president fought so hard and long? Frozen, pending abolition. Climate change, civil rights and LGBT rights? Wiped from the new administration’s website agenda. New priorities? A missile defence system that China has long warned could spark a nuclear arms race. And the institution of a new holiday, to be called the “national day of patriotism”, which looks more like a “national day of Trumpism”. Once again there are disturbing echoes of the marching armies, flag-waving and mass rallies of 1930s Europe. For the world at large, Trump’s overtly aggressive, nationalist message, emanating from the pole of liberal democracy and constitutional governance, spells a world of trouble. Biting its lip, China’s government has gone out of its way in recent weeks to minimise the impact of Trump’s repeated, confrontational remarks. Speaking at Davos last week, President Xi Jinping even suggested Beijing could supplant Washington as the standard-bearer for neoliberalism and globalisation. But Trump has failed to make any reciprocal gestures and, if anything, has widened the possible areas of conflict to include Taiwan, the South China Sea and trade tariffs. In Japan, Germany and other key financial and business centres, expectations of a damaging US-China collision are hardening. So-called strongmen leaders, who, like Trump, base their power on nationalist appeal, may be more amenable to his braggadocio politics. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s authoritarian president, is keenly anticipating improved relations with Washington. Benjamin Netanyahu can hardly contain his joy over the advent of an unthinkingly, recklessly pro-Israel replacement for Obama. In neither case does the change augur well for democratic politics or Middle East peace. In western Europe, where elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany are due this year in quick succession, the impact of the “Trump effect” on the fortunes of extreme nationalist, xenophobic and racist parties could be toxic. If he is inclined to meddle, which is entirely possible, Europe’s members must be ready to repulse him. When it comes to Russia, led by the messianic Vladimir Putin, a man after Trump’s own heart, the causes for concern over their future (or continued) collaboration are legion. Putin has succeeded in outmanoeuvring Trump every step of the way to the White House. His government’s cyber-meddling in the election process disadvantaged Hillary Clinton. This helped Trump, but it also compromised him. Earlier this month, it was claimed Moscow holds embarrassing personal material about the new US leader. This unproved claim has further undermined him. Now, with Trump looking for improved relations with Russia to justify his appeasement of Putin, Moscow is playing hard to get. Any bilateral summit would not take place for several months, Putin’s spokesman said at the weekend. Russia was making no promises. Not for the last time on the global stage, Trump is being played for a fool. Theresa May should be very careful this fate does not befall her, too, when she visits Washington, possibly this week. In her anxiety to renew the “special relationship”, fuelled by her gratuitous undermining of Britain’s European alliances, May presents an easy target for bully boy Trump. If past behaviour is anything to go by, Trump will take what he wants from Britain, which is, primarily, the conferring of international respectability on him and his despicable ideas, and spit out the rest. The Trump carnage will not be confined to America. • Comments will be opened later', 'Demonstrations against the fractious election campaign run by Donald Trump took place across the UK as he was inaugurated as the 45th US president. Lily Allen joined protesters demonstrating outside the US embassy in London, where about 2,000 people took part in a march and rally. And at least 1,500 are thought to have attended demonstrations in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Manchester, as well as other towns and cities around the country.\\nAllen sang Rufus Wainwright’s Going to a Town as protesters, politicians and trades unionists voiced their opposition to Trump. They accused him of being a threat to minorities and urged people to stand up to sexism, racism, homophobia and bigotry at the Stand Up to Racism demonstration. Coinciding with the protests in the US, some of which saw violence, around 1,000 people are thought to have attended a similar protest in Glasgow and another 500 in Manchester. And more than 200 banner-drops were expected to happen around the world, in cities including Brussels, Berlin, Rome, Madrid, Toronto, Sydney and San Diego. Nona Hurkmans, a spokesman for the organiser Bridges Not Walls, said: “On Trump’s inauguration day, we’re taking action to show our support for groups under attack – here in the UK, across Europe and in the USA – and to reject the rise of a dangerous and divisive far right politics.” A Women’s March on London is due to take place in the centre of the capital on Saturday afternoon. Other demonstrations are planned in Liverpool, Belfast and Cardiff, as well as Leeds, Southampton and York. And yet more due to take place in smaller towns, such as Bangor, Barnstaple and Lancaster, as well as Shipley and St Austell. In Edinburgh on Friday, hundreds of protesters marched from the foot of North Bridge to the US consulate. Protesters had banners that read: “Love Trumps Hate”, “No to racism, no to Trump” and “Hey Donald, I hope you step on a lego”. Hundreds of people chanted slogans, such as “Donald Trump go to hell – take the KKK as well” and “Donald Trump, go away – sexist, racist, anti-gay”. Earlier in the day, banners were draped from bridges across the world urging Trump to abandon his “politics of hate”. Nine bridges in London were adorned with the messages, while others were hung in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and Belfast. Trump claims strong links to Scotland and last visited in June 2016, during the US election campaign. His mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born and brought up on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, before emigrating to New York. And Trump has set up businesses in Scotland. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, congratulated Trump on taking office, but warned: “There are great global challenges to be faced and I wish his administration well in dealing with them. “The ties of family, friendship and business that bind our countries are very deep and long-standing. “We share fundamental values of equality, tolerance and human rights, and I hope to see these values upheld during the new President’s term in office. “Scotland and the United States will continue to co-operate in those areas where we share common interests and goals, and when appropriate we will also look to have constructive dialogue on issues where our views differ.”', 'As a man mesmerised by his own television persona, Donald Trump couldn’t stop himself staring directly down the lens of the camera poised to capture him just before he emerged on to the steps of the Capitol to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. “Hello,” breathed the star of Mr Smith Goes to Watchimself. Thus begins reality TV’s stunningly unsettling reboot of the fish-out-of-water genre. The president’s inaugural address sounded like it had been assembled from Donald Trump magnetic fridge poetry. Bridges, tunnels, “a historic movement the likes of which the world has never known”. It was as out-of-focus as his hair and served as an ominous reminder that that there is little so dangerous in politics as people who regard incredibly complex things as simple. “We are issuing a new decree: from this day forward, it’s going to be ONLY America first, America first … America will start winning again – winning like never before! … This American carnage stops right here, and stops RIGHT NOW!”\\nTwenty minutes of that, and Barack Obama’s airborne departure had shades of the last helicopter out of Saigon. Washington had fallen, the new president very much wanted America to know, as he stood right in the heart of it and denounced its every effort. As he assured the crowds, strikingly diminished in comparison with Obama’s: “Now arrives the hour of action.” It arrives for the media, too, especially the ones who marked time in the buildup by asking: “Will we see a new Donald Trump out there today?” Guys, there is one Donald Trump, there is one speech. There is no fault with your set. President Trump’s demeanour was so openly populist and bullish that it seemed primarily designed to provide portentous establishing footage for future documentaries with titles like Dark Star Rising, or The Gathering Storm. So unboundaried has the president been in his years-long campaign to lower the tone that it was difficult for any of the speeches, prayers and readings given by anyone else not to sound like a veiled lecture to him. “Pray for wisdom.” “God blesses those who are humble.” May he grant you the ability to resist 4am tweetstorms. Some of the requests were so dementedly hopeful they could only have been included as a dare. “We ask that you give him the meekness of Christ.” But at this point we’d settle for the meekness of Kanye West. It was a day to be glad of the displacement rituals of protocol, especially if you were the Obamas. You come up the stairs. We shake hands. You stand there. Now we wave. I think you take the farther car door. You see – you just made it through five minutes without giving in to the impulse to mention my birth certificate or the unprecedented size of your hands. Only three years, 364 days, 23 hours and 55 minutes to go. A clearly inspired Trump manfully got through the swearing-in oath, even though he must have regarded the whole hand-on-the-Bible aspect as a conspiracy to focus global attention on his little paws. In the event, it was far more dignified than Mike Pence’s oath, which was punctuated by someone in the crowd screaming “LOCK HER UP!” And so to Hillary Clinton, forced to participate in the world’s longest loser’s reaction shot. At the Oscars, you only have to grit your teeth and grin for a minute when Liz Hurley’s name comes out of the envelope instead of yours. On inauguration day, you have to keep that going for hours. The camera trained on Clinton as she waited inside the Capitol, ready to be formally introduced to the crowds by the announcer, caught her taking in a huge breath and setting her jaw. Comic interludes? Trump failing to understand his chair-based dad dancing was bad at the Lincoln memorial rock concert on Thursday night, but more excruciating still when swaying and nodding along to the Mormon Tabernacle choir. Then there was the detail that portable toilets for the crowds were provided by the same local firm which traditionally does it, only this time organisers were so antsy that they covered up the company name on the doors: Don’s Johns. Pretty sure that’s not the urination association they have to worry about. There were also oddly touching moments – like George W Bush being unable to keep the pleasure off his face when Michelle Obama picked him out and turned the full warmth of her spotlight greeting on him. Certainly, it was the first time I’ve seen that smirk look endearing. And it was hard not to feel sympathy for Melania Trump, who still looks like she’s wearing a first lady costume, and radiated anxiety about not putting a foot wrong. In the end, for those on board the Trump train, the aggressive display marked the day the slogan could start becoming a reality. But for much of the watching world, it will seem as if the lamps are going out all over America. It’s unclear when we shall see them lit again.', 'Among the many publications that have covered Donald Trump’s long career in the public eye, few have done so as consistently as Forbes magazine. The US president first appeared in the business title’s inaugural list of the America’s 400 richest people in 1982, and stayed there for much of the subsequent three and a half decades. But while it seems a natural fit between a magazine that celebrates success and a man who seems obsessed with claiming it, it is a relationship that has had its fair share of friction. “When we come out with the new list, several times over those decades we have written large stories on him,” says Forbes Media’s president and chief operating officer, Mike Federle, a couple of days before Trump’s inauguration. “This year we wrote a big one, because he was the presidential candidate, claiming [to be worth] $10bn, and we said it was more like $4bn.”\\nTrump has disputed Forbes’s evaluations of his wealth repeatedly over the years, leading its chief product officer, Lewis Dvorkin, to write a column titled “forever frenemies” in a 2015 issue, which featured Trump on the cover and an interview with the man himself conducted by the editor, Randall Lane. The frenemy relationship seems likely to continue, with Forbes expecting to tackle the uncertainties around what Trump’s presidency will mean for its readers in a similar way to the rest of the media, albeit with a less political bent. “We have a group of journalists who are working on the Trump beat,” says Federle. “It’s not to build him up or take him down in any way, it’s to translate his business policies and his policy effect on business. “A lot of news companies are creating a Trump desk, and I think it’s to address the total question mark that exists there. There’s a lot to fear on what he has said, on the economic front, and obviously there’s a lot that could turn out really well.” “The reporting is more around the question mark that exists around his administration. Can a businessman, ‘the greatest businessman in the world’ or the best or whatever he would say, can he actually pull off some of this stuff he said?”\\nThe magazine was founded by Bertie Forbes almost 100 years ago, and controlled by the family until they sold a majority stake to a Hong Kong-based private equity group in 2014 for more than $300m. The founder’s grandson, Steve Forbes, is today the editor-in-chief. But while many equally venerable competitors have stagnated, in recent years Forbes has moved in two very innovative directions, one of which bears a striking resemblance to Trump’s own business model. Like many magazines, Forbes has licensing deals with partners who publish versions around the world, but the company has also taken brand extension further than almost any other. In the Philippines, there was a recent deal to put the Forbes name on a tower in Manila’s Makati district, which also incidentally contains a Trump tower as well as others bearing the names of the fashion labels Armani and Versace. There is also a branded education business with a for-profit provider based in San Diego, though with regular input from Forbes, it appears to offer slightly more value than Trump University.\\nIt is almost surprising the company as yet has no plans to follow Trump in putting its name on steaks, though there was a Forbes wine club. It is an approach that Federle, who joined in 2011 and took over day-to-day running from the chief executive, Mike Perlis, last summer, says Forbes is especially well suited to. “Forbes is a really terrifically elastic brand. It’s business, it’s finance investing, it’s lifestyle luxury. If you distill it down to one word, it’s success. That brand lends itself to both business opportunities and lifestyle opportunities.” In 2010, Forbes launched its contributor network, which allowed anyone with an area of expertise to apply to publish direct to Forbes.com. After being vetted, contributors get paid based on traffic, and those in Europe also receive a flat fee. That year, Forbes also launched BrandVoice, which gave advertisers access to a similar platform. There are now about 2,000 contributors on the network, generating more of Forbes’ online traffic than its full-time editorial staff of under 100, while BrandVoice has attracted upwards of 140 partners. Although only a handful of contributors are thought to make a living off their pay cheques from Forbes alone, many see it as a convenient way to build a profile. And while Forbes’ “channel editors” take only a light-touch approach, Federle says the system takes advantage of the web’s natural self-policing. “It’s part of the nature of the internet,” he says. “You spell a name wrong in an article, someone says, ‘You dope, you spelled a name wrong’, and then you quickly can change it. If you get a key concept wrong, then you stimulate big debate. “In theory, it creates better journalism in the long run, in that you have a lot of editors. And I am talking in theory. We are in the evolutionary process of where journalism shifts.” Over the next year, Forbes plans to begin rolling out a new content management system better suited to mobile devices and social media, with a wider range of formats including graphs and video content. Driven largely by Dvorkin, Forbes has become a digital innovator, coinciding with an editorial shift away from a more straightforward focus on wealth and business to encompass what Federle describes as “entrepreneurial capitalism”. “Forbes has throughout its history been about free markets,” he says. “That is basically what we are still about, but more and more we’re covering entrepreneurial wealth. That’s the big shift, the whole world has become interested in innovations and change agents, people upsetting industries.” Part of that shift has been the magazine’s 30 under 30 list, aimed explicitly at the up and coming. The expansion of the list this year to include multiple categories and as many as 600 individuals in the US, and half that number in Europe, has been greeted with understandable scepticism, but Federle defends the move with reference to those who get name-checked. “We are really creating a community and these guys are incredible with how they network with each other,” says Federle, speaking before heading to the 30 under 30 Europe launch party in Camden Market in London. “I understand the cynicism, or snakiness online. But I tell you, you talk to these guys, it is life-changing to the guys we put on. For somebody with a startup they get more financing, they get speaking engagements, people calling wanting to partner with them. More and more of them will phone us up and say: ‘Hey, you really changed my life.’ “We are trying to identify the generation that will be really driving business and policy and change over the next 50 years.” While Forbes is out identifying the young people who are likely to shape the next half-century, there is greater uncertainty than ever before about what even the next four years will look like. Of particular interest to Forbes’ free-market friendly readers will be the president’s approach to globalisation. Federle is aware of Trump’s rhetoric on the topic, much of it hinting at a more projectionist stance, but remains unsure what it will result in: “Trump is [about] free markets with his spin on it, which is my market first and then every other one be afraid. That is a change, and I think it will be interesting to see,” he says. “Everyone is talking about what the future is going to look like under Trump, and I think everyone agrees no one knows.” CV Age 57 Education Tulane University: 1977-79; Colby College: 1979-81 1999 Publisher at Fortune magazine 2006 Group publisher at Time Inc business and finance network 2009 CEO at B2B Networks 2009 Group publisher at Bonnier Mountain Group 2010 President and COO at Techonomy Media Inc 2011 COO at Forbes Media 2016 President and COO at Forbes Media This article was amended on 30 January 2017 to provide more detail about how the contributor network is run, and to make clear that Brandvoice operates on a similar, but not the same platform.', 'Most newspapers across Europe predict that Donald Trump will be a reckless world leader, viewing him as a buffoon and fearing that he will undermine transatlantic relations and weaken the European Union. They are also worried that he might make deals with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, at the expense of smaller countries in central and eastern Europe. Newspaper articles published over a seven-day period prior to Trump’s inauguration are said to reveal a level of trepidation about the incoming American president that is probably unparalleled in recent history. By contrast, some papers do see his honesty as a positive attribute, one that might help to solve conflicts rather than stimulate them. These findings emerge from an analysis by the European Journalism Observatory of the content of three daily newspapers in each of 10 European countries from 12 to 18 January. The countries studied were Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Ukraine and the UK. Most of the articles related to three events. First, Trump’s press conference as president elect in which he said: “Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I’m leading it than when other people have led it.” Second, the interview with Michael Gove in The Times, in which Trump declared Nato was obsolete. And third, his interview with Germany’s (and Europe’s) best-selling daily, Bild, in which he was critical of chancellor Angela Merkel’s refugee policy. Among the reactions: “Europe’s nightmare” (Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung); “Trump ruins the European Union” (Poland’s Gazeta Wyborcza); and “Europe could be the first victim of Trump” (commentator in Italy’s Corriere della Sera). But Kai Diekman, Bild’s publisher, said: “Trump has been the biggest political experiment since the end of the cold war. Trump says things which are actually unthinkable in diplomacy. He is rude, he is insulting – and he is painfully honest. This can lead to conflicts, but also break open crusted conflicts.” And some pro-Russian media in eastern European countries showed sympathy for Trump acting as a strong man in the White House. European media were virtually unanimous in their assessment that an alliance between Trump and Putin will have harmful consequences for Europe. Portugal’s Público commented: “If Trump succeeds in accomplishing his Russian policy, the first ‘casualty’ will be Europe. It will be marginalised. It will drift apart.” Not surprisingly, Trump’s potential rapprochement with Russia particularly alarmed news media in central and eastern Europe. Latvia’s Latvijas Avize said a “deal with Putin won’t bring peace (…) it makes war even likelier.” Despite striking similarities in the negative (or, at best, neutral) tone of the media coverage, some news outlets expressed cautious optimism that a Trump presidency might actually yield positive outcomes, especially for the economy. According to some analyses in Austrian newspapers, stock markets might react favourably to Trump’s promises of reducing taxes and curbing the bureaucracy. And some German commentators expressed hopes for Trump’s deal-making skills. Surprisingly, says the EJO study, few papers focused on the potential implications of a Trump presidency on their own nation’s outlook. Domestic issues, such as the rise of right-wing populism and similarities between Europe and the US about a general disillusionment with political elites, received little coverage over the seven days. Among those commentators who did highlight potential connections, was the biggest Czech daily Mladá fronta Dnes. It said: “After the victory of Brexit supporters and Donald Trump, it seems as anything can happen in the West. “In this context, the scenario of Marine Le Pen winning the [2017] presidential election and a subsequent French referendum on leaving the European Union does not look like a figment of a lunatic.” Source, plus detailed report, including reaction by three US papers to Trump’s statements on Europe: EJO', 'Remember when the closest a politician got to a baby was when he got to kiss one, for the photographers? Me neither. Nothing is as it used to be in American politics. The Democratic candidate is a woman – a first for a major American political party.\\nAnd the Republican candidate is a man-baby, a failed businessman who lurches from tantrum to tweet storm and back again, who shows no impulse control, who won’t take responsibility for his actions, and who whines – a lot – when things don’t go his way. As First Lady Michelle Obama said at a Thursday rally in New Hampshire, even a six-year-old knows better. She was being kind. Most three-year-olds have a better grasp of what constitutes good behavior. Did everyone see Trump tell Sunday’s debate moderators – “it’s three-on-one” - that they’d given more time for Hillary Clinton to speak than they had him. In fact, Trump spoke a little more than a minute longer – 40:10 compared with 39:05 – than his opponent. Of course, that included time he spent interrupting, another toddler trait. In addition to the tantrums, Trump gets his days and nights mixed up. He doesn’t sleep much at night. He pouts. And we, the electorate, are left to watch, horrified. Donald J Trump has never been the most mature of public figures, but things went south in a big way in August, when Trump had already bagged his party’s nomination, and he was speaking at a Virginia rally. (Was this before or after his campaign promised he’d act more presidential? It’s hard to remember. There have been so many promises.) And then a baby started crying. At first, Trump seemed game – babies will cry, after all. But not long afterward, he asked that that baby be removed. He may have been joking, but then again, maybe not. It appears he didn’t like the competition. The press had a field day, and then Trump did was he does best: He threw a tantrum. At the time, Politicus USA called it a “new low”. Ha, ha! If only. A toddler in a 70-year-old body is an ugly thing. There is no hope of maturation – that ship has sailed. There is also no predicting what will happen. Just before the baby incident, Trump verbally excoriated a Gold Star family whose son, Army Captain Humayun Khan, died in Iraq in 2004. I’d say everyone knows to be respectful of a grieving family who gave one of their own for their country, but that has to be amended to say “every adult”. In no particular order, Trump has pouted or thrown a full-on tantrum about a former Miss Universe, Rosie O’Donnell, the American press, Bill Clinton, women who report sexual assault (unless they are accusing Bill Clinton), Muslims and Hillary Clinton, whom he wants to jail. The newest low came earlier this week. The New York Times ran damning stories from women who said Trump made unwanted advances toward them. Trump denied the allegations and then he threatened to sue. For that, he got a snootful from the Times’ lawyer (and America’s new hero), David E McCraw. His much-circulated letter ended with the bon mot that if the Republican candidate felt wronged, the Times would “welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight”.\\nBoom! Wouldn’t we all? Wouldn’t it be fun to see a 70-year-old man-baby get the book thrown at him by a judge who’s not having any of it? Most of Trump’s tweets since the lawyer’s letter was made public have centered on his comings and goings, and his rallies where he promises to make America great again. But stay tuned. Some early morning – very soon, when the lights are out at Trump Tower – he’ll rise from his crib, reach for his Android/pacifier, and do what soothes him most. There is no time-out big enough.', 'When I arrived in Afghanistan in 2011 for the first time, I proudly displayed several patches on my shoulders. One was the flag of the United States, the country I love so much. Another was the 10th Mountain Division insignia, representing the unit with which I had been deployed. But there was also one more: the Isaf patch, signifying participation in Nato’s International Security Assistance Force. So, when President-elect Donald Trump claimed in a recent interview that Nato is obsolete in part because it “didn’t deal with terrorism,” I was dismayed. Trump’s assertion is patently untrue, and it disrespects the efforts that fellow Nato members have made to combat this threat. In case Trump needs a history lesson, the North Atlantic Treaty, signed in 1949, including article five, provides that Nato countries will collectively defend each other in the event of armed attack on any member. Through the Cold War, Article 5 never had to be invoked, which is a testament to the organization’s deterrent effect on adversaries. But following the 9/11 attacks on the United States conducted by al-Qaida – who had been harbored by the Taliban in Afghanistan – Nato invoked Article 5 for the first time ever, specifically to deal with terrorism. Whether Nato’s campaign against terrorism has been effective is a fair question. Some might argue that al-Qaida, which has been unable to conduct another attack on the scale of 9/11, has largely been denied safe haven in Afghanistan, and that terrorism does not present an existential threat. On the other hand, some might argue that al-Qaida’s persistence and a resurging Taliban provide evidence that Nato has not succeeded in its task. One could also argue that Nato should be more involved in countering Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq and Syria, because of the threat the organization projects into Europe. However, these considerations should not obscure the undoubted fact that Nato has taken concrete steps to deal with terrorism since 9/11. In addition, despite what some may think, the burden of the Nato mission has fallen on the shoulders not only of the US. Consider the fatalities suffered by Nato members in Afghanistan. If we use the methodology of a 2010 analysis that looked at fatalities-per-population and apply it again today, we can see the tiny country of Denmark ranks higher than the United States, which comes in second. It therefore appears that Trump was shooting from the hip, blatantly disregarding history and disrespecting Nato allies along the way. But should we be surprised? When it comes to fighting terrorism, Trump is clueless. This is the same man, after all, who ludicrously proposed that Mosul could and should be captured from Isis in a surprise attack. According to outgoing CIA Director John Brennan, this kind of careless spontaneity is “not something that protects national security interests.” Will he ever learn?', 'Hamlet without the prince. That, bluntly, is how Davos feels this year. The usual caravan of business leaders, academics, clerics, journalists and celebs has trekked up into the high Alps for their annual January get-together, but the man everyone is talking about is 3,000 miles away awaiting his inauguration in Washington later this week. Donald Trump is dominating proceedings. A survey of business executives conducted by PwC showed that companies are worried by Donald Trump’s protectionist rhetoric. Predictably, the concerns are strongest in the US and Mexico given what the president-elect has said about building a wall along the Rio Grande. Trump’s influence can also be felt in other ways. The manner in which he won the US election, tapping in to deep-seated anger about the unfair distribution of the spoils of economic growth, has been noted. There is talk in Davos of the need to ensure that globalisation works for everyone.\\nThis is not new. Klaus Schwab, the man who founded the World Economic Forum in the early 1970s, warned as long ago as 1996 that globalisation had entered a critical phase. “A mounting backlash against its effects, especially in the industrial democracies, is threatening a very disruptive impact on economic activity and social stability in many countries,” he said. Schwab’s warning was not heeded. There was no real attempt to make globalisation work for everyone. Communities affected by the export of jobs to countries where labour was cheaper were left to rot. The rewards of growth went disproportionately to a privileged few. Resentment quietly festered until there was a backlash. For Schwab, Brexit and Trump are a bitter blow, a repudiation of what he likes to call the spirit of Davos. It would be wrong, however, to imagine that business is terrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency. Boardrooms rather like the idea of a big cut in US corporation tax. They favour deregulation. They purr at plans to spend more on infrastructure. Wall Street is happy because it thinks the new president will mean stronger growth and higher corporate earnings. In Trump’s absence, it has been left to two senior members of the outgoing Obama administration – his vice-president, Joe Biden, and secretary of state John Kerry – to fly the US flag. Just as significantly, Xi Jinping is the first Chinese president to attend Davos and has made it clear that, unlike Trump, he has no plans to resile from international obligations. The sense of a changing of the guard is palpable.', 'Bear with me, because this is difficult. Baring the soul is always difficult. But one reaches the point where the suppression itself causes more damage than the revelation. So here goes: we need to talk about Donald. You saw that video, when Trump bragged about using his fame to assault women, and you’ve heard the racism – about African Americans, Mexicans.\\nYou saw Sunday’s debate when he menaced and threatened and swaggered and lied. I saw it too, but not perhaps as you saw it, for I spent much of the time looking at his suit and feeling a tad embarrassed. It was quite a nice blue suit. Until recently, I had one quite similar. Not just alike in terms of cut or colour; mine actually had his name on it. Not Tom Ford, or Paul Smith, or Hugo Boss (as if I could afford that). This was a Donald J Trump brand suit. It was pinstriped with fairly big lapels and turn-ups on the trousers. I liked it because it reminded me to some extent of the dramatic cloth-rich baggy suits my father and his Windrush generation used to wear. And so, on a visit to New York a few years ago, I bought it from Macy’s department store. It wasn’t cheap, but it didn’t break the bank. It was always problematic. I didn’t know much about Trump. I didn’t know he made suits, for a start, or that – much more likely – he had textile workers in Bangladesh, China, maybe Mexico to make them for him. I knew he was a bit naff and that his association with my suit was no kind of fashion statement, but I really did like it so I kept the sole mention of his name – the rectangular label sewn within the jacket, with “Donald J Trump” in gold letters – close to my chest, as it were.\\nPeople thought the suit was great. If anyone asked for details, I’d just say “I got it in New York” and the vagueness of that declaration would always deter further inquiry. But that’s the problem with deception. Even for the most skilled practitioner, the inner doubts never really go away. And so it was with me and my suit from the Trump Collection. As a garment it seemed fine, but how to wear it without thinking of his preposterous bird’s-nest hair, his ridiculous self-regard, his place in American culture while hosting The Apprentice as joke fodder for every late-night comedian? The doubts ate steadily away at me just as moths might happily have eaten away at the suit. Finally the troubling ratio: outward elegance set against the inner degradation, tilted irretrievably. A year ago, I took the Donald suit to the charity shop. Now, when the world knows all it needs to know about his depravity and lunacy, that seems to me a lucky escape. I understand that it may not seem that way to everyone, for in a modern world where celebrity and commerce skip hand-in-hand, we all buy products created or promoted by famous people we don’t know. Some may be admirable, some may privately be rogues. They may be liberal; they may be illiberal. Our purchase decision may be driven by the association of the product with the celebrity or may just be a statement about the excellence of the item itself. But whatever we think of it, the link is there and from time to time that can be problematic. How many lucky enough to have anything designed by John Galliano reached for the scissors when he was convicted in 2011 for hurling racist and antisemitic abuse? In 2012 French anti-racist groups called for a boycott of the perfume maker Jean-Paul Guerlain after he used the N-word on national television. How many poured his expensive potions down the sink? Does Gary Lineker induce you to buy more crisps or Davina McCall to change your hair dye? If George Clooney turned out to be a cad, would you stop drinking his coffee? Our status as consumers interconnecting with the famous as we shop can present dilemmas. I dodged the bullet with Trump’s suit, but feel bad even now, because when I handed it to the charity shop, where I was praised for my benevolence, I didn’t declare it. I didn’t say, “This may look nice and it’s in good nick, but there is a darkness to it and anyone who buys it must be wary.” It was donated “as seen”, which might have been OK at the time, when Trump was just a bit ludicrous, but now feels akin to passing on a nasty virus. Someone, somewhere may now be wearing that suit, weighed down by its associations. If so, I apologise and hope they dispose of it more responsibly than I did. But then there is another possibility that someone – a Trumpite – now wears that suit with pride, as a symbol of all that links them with the man who has brought politics lower than any of us thought it could ever spiral. Cowardly perhaps, but I prefer not to dwell on it.', 'The bad news? This week sees a misogynist, climate-denying authoritarian sworn in as the next president of the United States. The good news? Gorillaz have marked the historic event with a new track – their first in six years. Swings and roundabouts. Hallelujah Money is, as the title might give away, a song about the worship of $$$ and the corrosive influence of big business on politics. Starring 2015 Mercury prize winner Benjamin Clementine in full quavering voice mode, it features lyrics about building walls and the all-consuming desire for power. “Thank you my friend / For trusting me,” Clementine warns, ominously. The whole thing is suitably unsettling throughout – a slice of futurist gospel which sees Clementine channelling his deepest Nina Simone, before Damon Albarn’s voice floats by, as melancholic as ever, to ask: “How will we know / When the morning comes / We are still humans / How will we know?” Does it get any cheerier? Not really. “Don’t worry my friend / If this be the end, then so shall it be,” says Clementine towards the end. Really makes you feel better about everything doesn’t it?', 'You might have thought that, after conducting an interview with Donald Trump that read like a celebrity puff piece for an airline inflight magazine and then posing for a cheesy, sleazy photo under a Playboy cover, Michael Gove might have wanted to lie low for a bit to recover from the embarrassment. Not a bit of it. Gove’s narcissism will not be contained and he spent Monday morning doing a tour of any media outlet that would have him to boast about his underachievement. First stop was Radio 4’s Today programme where presenter Sarah Montague first challenged him on Trump’s assertion that a UK-US trade deal post-Brexit could be done quickly and easily. “I’m no expert in trade negotiations,” Gove said proudly. In Gove World lack of expertise in any field automatically makes you ideally qualified for the job. “But I can tell you that Trump is a dealmaker and he is confident he can make a deal that is win-win for Britain and America.”\\nMontague’s blink could be felt even on the radio. Hadn’t Gove understood that the most basic thing about Trump is that there is no such thing as a win-win deal for him? A Trump deal always involves winners and losers and it was fairly obvious who the president-elect saw as the losers in any future trade deals. Besides which, we wouldn’t be able to do any negotiations until we had left the EU. “Donald Trump is the most powerful man in the world,” Mikey announced. “He can do whatever he wants. And he definitely wants to do a deal with Britain because he’s emotionally and financially invested in Brexit. Donald loves Brexit.” Realising she wasn’t going to get anything intelligent out of Gove on trade deals, Montague moved on. Why hadn’t he asked Trump any difficult questions? “That’s easy,” replied Gove. “One of the things about Donald Trump is he doesn’t like people asking him any questions.” It was now becoming clear why the Don had chosen Mikey to interview him. The man who didn’t want to be asked any questions would be interrogated by the man who wouldn’t ask any. “A question is just a a prompt to the next flow of rhetoric and information,” Mikey continued, hoping this would do as an explanation for his own shortcomings. “You do realise that Trump actually committed to nothing during your entire interview,” an incredulous Montague pointed out. “He’s changed his mind so often on issues. Did you trust him?” Mikey was audibly hurt by the suggestion that his whole interview had been little more than an exercise in idle gossip and speculation. “This was the first time I’d met him,” he said defensively, “and I can’t make a window into Donald Trump’s soul. But I did find him very engaging.” Sure, the Don might have said a few not-so-clever remarks about women and foreigners from time to time and again, but at heart he was just a big softy. Montague pressed Mikey harder. Did Trump want to destabilise the EU? No, he wanted to destabilise the whole world. Wouldn’t toadying our way to a win-lose deal with the US jeopardise our negotiations with the EU? Not at all. It would strengthen our already strong hand. Don’t forget, Britain could always turn itself into a tax haven and throw the poor to the wolves. “Anyone might think you were trying to line yourself up as the UK’s next ambassador to the US,” said Montague. Mikey laughed nervously. “Oh no, no,” he replied modestly. “There are people far better qualified than me.” By the time Mikey was asked the same question on Sky News 45 minutes later, he was sounding a great deal less modest. It wasn’t for him to put himself forward, but now he had had time to reflect there weren’t nearly so many better qualified people as he had originally thought. “I don’t think so,” he said, in the manner of a man who wasn’t ruling anything out. Still Mikey’s masochistic desires were not yet satisfied and later in the morning he turned up on BBC2’s Daily Politics where Jo Coburn gave him the biggest putdown yet. “You had the president-elect for an hour and you didn’t once challenge him on any inconsistencies?” she observed. Mikey beamed. At last. Someone who got the point. It had never been about what Trump did or didn’t say. It had been about, he, the Great Mikey, getting a whole hour of Trump’s time. To bask in the orange glow of reflected glory. Me and Mini-Me. Don and Mini-Don. Mini-Mini-Mikey.', 'A council worker from Brighton, whom Donald Trump mistook on Twitter for his own daughter, has urged the president-elect to face up to his responsibilities and learn more about climate change. Trump quoted a praiseworthy tweet directed to him by Lawrence Goodstein, a Twitter user in Seekonk, Massachusetts, that described his daughter Ivanka as “a woman with real character and class” late on Monday. But Goodstein had mistakenly put @Ivanka, not @IvankaTrump – not a significant mistake in light of Goodstein’s 160-odd followers, but of far greater consequence circulated by Trump to his 20.1 million.\\nSo Trump’s shoutout was instead directed to Ivanka Majic, a council worker from Brighton, England, who used to work for the Labour party, whose number of Twitter followers doubled overnight. Majic has taken advantage of her moment on the global stage by urging Trump to both take more care in his tweets and accept the scientific consensus about manmade climate change, which Trump challenged during his campaign. Replying to the president-elect, she tweeted: “And you’re a man with great responsibilities. May I suggest more care on Twitter and more time learning about #climatechange.” She also tweeted data pointing out that 97.5% of publishing climatologists and about 90% of all publishing scientists supported the human-induced climate theory.\\nOvernight Majic has attracted a global following. “Ivanka Majic from Brighton, England, is a wonderful woman. You’re right,” replied Mark Pygas, a writer for Distractify, to Trump and Goodstein. “I mean, she’s probably trying to sleep and her phone is going off the hook but it’s a hell of a story.” According to a subsequent screenshot tweeted by Pygas, Goodstein blocked him for pointing out the error and made his account private.\\nTrump had not deleted his tweet nor acknowledged his mistake at the time of writing, though Goodstein made his account private. It had been retweeted 2,800 times and favourited 15,000 times, with more than 4,600 replies – the vast majority of them including Majic. The Guardian has attempted to contact Majic, believed to be employed as a researcher at Brighton and Hove city council. Her profile suggests she is not as active a user of Twitter as the president-elect, with just six tweets – most of them retweets – in the past week. Her last activity on Twitter was a retweet encouraging votes in Brighton’s upcoming restaurant competition and another publicising a resident’s appeal for the return of her lost house keys. On Saturday, Majic had tweeted a link to a news story about Brighton’s “thriving food scene”:\\nMeanwhile, Ivanka Trump, who campaigned with Trump and is moving to Washington DC as her husband, Jared Kushner, becomes a senior White House adviser, seemed oblivious to the compliment paid to her by Goodstein, sharing a photo of “#datenight” with her 2.74 million followers.\\nGoldstein’s misdirected tweet had come during a CNN programme on the incoming first daughter featuring interviews with her brothers, Donald Jnr and Eric Trump, and about which their father had expressed concerns:\\nAs president, Trump will have the option of taking over the official @POTUS Twitter handle or maintaining his own, @realDonaldTrump. With 20.1 million followers hanging on his every missive compared with @POTUS’s 13.5 million, Trump has given no indication he will make the switch.\\nSean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, told CNN earlier this month that Trump would “probably be tweeting from both, or whatever he chooses”. Last week, BuzzFeed News publicised concerns that Trump’s “shockingly insecure” personal Twitter account had no known special security protections and was open to being exploited with potentially devastating impacts for the stock market and geopolitical stability. It would not be the first time Trump’s account has been hacked: in 2013, when he was best-known as a real estate tycoon and host of The Apprentice TV show, someone reportedly gained access to his account to tweet Lil Wayne lyrics (“These hoes think they classy, well that’s the class I’m skippen”, from the remix of will.i.am and Britney Spear’s Scream & Shout). “My Twitter has been seriously hacked --- and we are looking for the perpetrators,” Trump tweeted at the time.', 'A former contestant from The Apprentice is suing Donald Trump for defamation in relation to claims he groped and aggressively kissed her and then called her a liar. Summer Zervos filed the lawsuit on Tuesday demanding that the president-elect “vindicate her reputation” by admitting the allegations are true. Zervos announced the suit at a press conference at the Los Angeles office of her attorney, Gloria Allred, three days before Trump is due to be inaugurated, reviving a theme which dogged his election last year. “I want Mr Trump to know that I would still be willing to dismiss my case against him immediately for no monetary compensation if he will simply retract his false and defamatory statements about me and acknowledge that I told the truth about him,” Zervos told reporters, reading from a brief statement. The 20-page suit, filed in a New York court, makes a full-throated assault against the incoming United States commander-in-chief, calling him a sexual predator and misogynist who assaulted many women and then abused his political platform to brand them liars. “But it was Donald Trump who was lying when falsely denied his predatory misconduct with Summer Zervos, and derided her for perpetrating a ‘hoax’ and making up a ‘phoney’ story to get attention,” it said. Allred, a veteran women’s rights attorney with a flair for publicity, said she and Zervos would join the women’s march on Washington on Saturday, a day after Trump is sworn in. The lawyer cited Paula Jones, who sued Bill Clinton in 1994, as an example of taking on a sitting president over alleged sexual harassment. “That is the essence and beauty of our system of justice. No one is above the law, including the president-elect, soon to be president of the United States.” A Trump spokesperson, Hope Hicks, told the Guardian via email: “More of the same from Gloria Allred. There is no truth to this absurd story.” There was no immediate personal response from Trump, who in the past has used Twitter to rebut the accusations. The suit was the first legal confirmation that the allegations of sexual misconduct will follow Trump into the White House. But its chance of success was an open question, with Allred calling it a David and Goliath case. A trickle of allegations against Trump turned into a surge last October after a leaked Access Hollywood tape showed him boasting about sexual assault in a conversation with the host, Billy Bush, in 2005. “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful [women] – I just start kissing them,” said Trump. “It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it ... grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” Zervos was one of those who came forward after the tape surfaced. A Californian with aspirations to run a restaurant, she had participated in the fifth season of NBC’s The Apprentice, a reality show Trump hosted. Zervos alleged that during a visit to Trump’s office in December 2007, he kissed her twice on the mouth without her consent. He allegedly went further during a meeting at his bungalow in a Beverly Hills hotel, forcibly kissing, embracing and pressing his genitals against her. According to the suit, Zervos felt compelled to speak out after Trump dismissed the Access Hollywood remarks as locker-room banter and said he had never assaulted anyone – “a boldfaced lie”, according to the suit. Zervos went public at a press conference at Allred’s office on 14 October. Hours later, Trump’s campaign issued a statement denying her accusations and in turn accusing her of seeking the spotlight. The Republican candidate followed up with tweets and remarks at rallies accusing Zervos and other alleged victims of fabricating “phoney”, “100% false”, “outright lies” for political and monetary gain. The suit said the president-elect was the mendacity peddler. “What did Donald Trump, the liar and misogynist do, to cover up up his lies? He lied again, and debased and denigrated Ms Zervos with false statements about her.” It continued: “Trump knew that his false, disparaging statements would be heard and read by people around the world, and that these women, including Summer Zervos, would be subjected to threats of violence, economic harm and reputational damage. Allred said Trump’s lawyers would muster powerful resources to defeat the suit but that he still must answer for his actions in a court of law, not via tweets from his bedroom.', 'A great deal of Donald Trump’s political success can be put down to his body language and the unusual ways he uses his face. The first thing we notice about Trump’s facial expressions is the sheer variety. The second is their dramatic, often over-stated character. This was evident before and during the presidential election. While the other candidates – Hillary Clinton included – were struggling to appear likeable and restrained, Trump was busy performing grimaces that would not have looked out of place in Japanese Noh theatre. But what are Trump’s signature facial expressions, and what do they tell us about him? 1. Alpha face\\nDuring the campaign, Trump eclipsed Clinton in the macho stakes. He did this by adopting an “alpha face” of lowered brows, narrowed eyes and a firmly set mouth. This expression is the antithesis of submissiveness. Psychologists have discovered that smiling men are widely perceived as less dominant and that powerful men show reduced levels of smiling. Individuals who want to demonstrate that they are not a threat are more likely to raise their eyebrows, widen their eyes and flash a smile – the precise opposite of what Trump does in this effort to remind everyone that he is not the kind of guy you can push around. 2. Angry face\\nMost politicians, when they are angry, will allow themselves a modicum of indignation. That’s not enough for Trump. When he’s incensed, he pulls out all the stops and produces a larger-than-life spectacle of fury – eyes narrowed, brows tightly knitted together, mouth open and jaw tense. It is tempting to think that Trump’s outbursts come from a lack of inhibition, but their true source is more likely to be his realisation that exhibitions of anger reinforce an impression of dominance. This is certainly in line with research by psychologists, which shows that people with a strong sense of entitlement, or who see themselves as powerful and unchallenged, are more ready to engage in public displays of anger than others. 3. Chin-jut\\nOne of the ways that Trump tries to look like a tough politician is by jutting out his chin. The chin-jut relies on the fact that men with bigger chins have higher levels of testosterone and, partly for this reason, are more likely to reach positions of power. In a study at West Point military academy in the US, for example, it was discovered that male cadets who had larger chins were more likely to reach the rank of general in later life than their small-chinned peers. By using the chin-jut, Trump is taking full advantage of this fact – tilting his head back, thrusting out his lower jaw and attempting to give the impression that he deserves to be in charge. 4. Big smile\\nAlthough Trump instinctively recognises the demeaning potential of smiling, there are occasions when he is prepared to throw caution to the wind and give a full-blown smile, with his teeth on display and wrinkles around the corners of the eyes – the latter being the feature that defines a genuine as opposed to a fake display of happiness. Trump tends to produce these beaming smiles when he is in a convivial setting and when he doesn’t feel the need to look like a leader, or when he is with people whose company he enjoys – as demonstrated by his post-election photograph with Nigel Farage. 5. Zipped smile\\nThis is the smile that Trump defaults to when he is in the public eye: the mouth is closed and the teeth remain hidden. That’s because the risorius muscles, which pull the corners of the mouth sideways, are much more active in this case than the zygomatic major muscles, which pull the corners of the mouth upwards and are otherwise involved in a full-blown smile. The result of this is that the zipped smile appears more guarded – and because the mouth is stretched sideways, it makes the face look slightly wider. There could be several reasons why Trump is so attached to the zipped smile. One is that it makes him look less submissive. By avoiding a full-blown smile, he is able to appear circumspect, while keeping his options open – something he evidently likes to do. Another reason is that zipped smiles make the mouth look wider. There is evidence, both from animals and humans, that mouth width is linked to readiness to engage in physical combat, and it has also been found that men with wider mouths are more likely to attain leadership positions. Trump might also be unconsciously attracted to the zipped smile because it increases the apparent width-to-height ratio of his face, which in turn makes him look more masculine and macho. Psychologists have consistently shown that men with a high facial width-to-height ratio are not only seen as tougher and more attractive, they also have higher levels of testosterone and are actually more competitive.But there is always the possibility that the origins of Trump’s zipped smile are cultural rather than personal. It is known, for example, that while Americans favour a full-blown smile that showcases the teeth, British people have historically preferred tight-lipped versions of the smile. There is every chance therefore that Trump’s zipped smile is actually a throwback to his Scottish ancestors – which would of course demonstrate that his public persona is far less American than he has led us to believe. 6. Puckered chin\\nSome of Trump’s zipped smiles are straightforward, but a large proportion of them are accompanied by a puckeredchin. These are what psychologists call “blended facial expressions”. The presence of this additional facial expression is quite significant because people often pull their chins in when they feel threatened – it’s a way of tensing the chin in anticipation of being symbolically punched in the face. The fact that a puckered chin features in so many of Trump’s zipped smiles suggests that he frequently feels threatened. Because zipped smiles are so effective at capturing people’s attention, they provide a perfect vehicle for Trump to disguise his feelings of vulnerability. All this is likely to be entirely unconscious, but by unwittingly externalising his feelings in this way Trump proves that he is not as tough as he would like everyone to think. 7. Exaggerated mouth\\nYou can’t help notice the way Trump protrudes and contorts his mouth. In fact, his lips appear to have an almost prehensile quality, as if they were an extra pair of hands, reaching out from his face to manipulate the world around him. There are, however, at least two explanations we might consider. One is that Trump amplifies his lip movements because he is not completely convinced that people fully understand what he’s saying. Studies have shown that when mothers are talking to their infants, they often protrude their lips and make exaggerated mouth movements in an attempt to make themselves better understood. Is Trump operating on a similar assumption? Does he feel that the capacity of his audience to understand is so limited that he needs to enlist every articulatory channel to get his message across? It is also conceivable that Trump’s exaggerated mouth movements are simply another example of a generalised strategy that involves using “supernormal stimuli” to attract attention to himself. The term supernormal stimuli” was coined by the eminent zoologist, Nico Tinbergen, who discovered that herring gulls and stickleback fish responded with greater vigour when they were presented with exaggerated stimuli than when they were exposed to the stimuli they would normally encounter. Recent research on humans suggests that, like birds and fish, we too have an innate orienting reflex to supernormal stimuli, and that we respond more powerfully to things that are larger-than-life, whether in the realm of luxury goods, food or sex. Maybe Trump’s mouth movements – together with his histrionic hand gestures and overstated opinions – are all unknowingly designed to capitalise on this human reaction. • So which facial expressions will Trump opt for during his inauguration? Will he try to present himself as a tough guy by putting on his alpha face and jutting out his chin, or will he embrace everyone with a big smile, or possibly even a zipped smile, with or without a puckered chin? Whatever happens, Trump’s face is sure to provide important clues about his attitude to the occasion and what is going through his mind. Having chosen to be everyone’s face, there’s really nowhere for him to hide.', 'Last weekend, because I am a masochist, I read an interview with Ella Mills, nee Woodward, aka Deliciously Ella, the figurehead of the clean-eating movement. I’ve been writing about the bread-phobic brigade for a few years now (like I said, I’m a masochist), and I check in with them occasionally to see how, exactly, they’re stretching their glamorisation of disordered eating yet further. Yet on reading this latest dispatch, I had an unexpected epiphany: Deliciously Ella is the precursor to Donald Trump. A sylph-like, wildly privileged girl from west London looks a little less aspirational when you realise she’s from the same mould as a race-baiting Oompa Loompa with a Weetabix (gluten!) on his head, doesn’t she? And it’s not just Deliciously Ella. Like John Cusack in Being John Malkovich, I suddenly see the face of my man everywhere. I am finally realising that so many of the things that have frustrated me, that I have been trying to understand over the past year, come under one umbrella: the umbrella of bullshit. In 2005, the philosopher Harry G Frankfurt wrote an essay called On Bullshit. (It will always please me that Harry G Frankfurt is exactly the sort of name a bullshitting philosopher would have in a Marx brothers movie.) Lies and bullshit are both about deception, Frankfurt wrote; but while lying is a conscious act of obscuring the truth, bullshitting has no interest at all in the truth, “An indifference to how things really are,” is the way Frankfurt puts it.\\nWhich brings me to the connection between Deliciously Ella and Donald Trump. In her latest incarnation, Mills professes herself shocked that some of her followers have “taken healthy eating to extremes” and insists she “can’t take responsibility”. Then, in the next breath, she talks enthusiastically about how, for Christmas dinner, she ate just carrots and brussels sprouts. She says she doesn’t believe that food should be classified as either good or bad. So, as the righteous food blogger The Angry Chef has noted, it must be a different Ella who on her own website writes that “to really thrive”, you should say goodbye to dairy and gluten. Meanwhile, Trump has been furiously insisting that, contrary to what Meryl Streep (“the most overrated actress in Hollywood”) said at the Golden Globes, he “never mocked a disabled reporter”, even though there is widely circulated TV footage of him doing just that. Trump has also insisted he can’t possibly take responsibility for the number of racists who have supported him or committed crimes in his name, having apparently forgotten about the times he made racist remarks himself. The president-elect is interested only in his own self-promotion; he is not lying, because for him an objective truth isn’t even a consideration – he is bullshitting.\\nThe denigration of experts, as I wrote last week, is an essential component to this bullshitting culture, because expertise provides a bulwark against nonsense. Food writer Bee Wilson recently described how she and a registered dietician, Renee McGregor, were jeered by several hundred people at the Cheltenham Literary festival when they dared point out some of the flaws in clean-eating cook Madeleine Shaw’s thinking (coconut sugar is still sugar). When the leading lights of the Brexit movement are called out on their lies and lack of preparedness, they cry “elitism” and pose in front of a gold door with a billionaire. We live in a blog culture where it’s pitched as a triumph of democracy that everyone can claim authority, which means anyone who says that, actually, there is an objective truth is condemned. Feelings rather than facts are what matter, these purveyors of bullshit claim, and the success of this, as Tom Nichols writes in his upcoming book The Death Of Expertise, represents “the full flowering of a therapeutic culture where self-esteem, not achievement, is the ultimate human value, and it’s making us all dumber by the day”. Nothing proves this more starkly than the way celebrities have filled the vacuum where experts used to be, because who appears to have more self-esteem than a celebrity? And so people with popular Instagram accounts are trusted over registered dieticians, panel-show politicians such as Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson are validated, and a reality TV star is elected president. Yet, as Trump proves daily, few people have more fragile self-esteem. And what do you get once their facade is proven to be false? Just bullshit. That’s gross in a cookbook, but genuinely terrifying in politics.', 'To celebrate its 225th anniversary, the US Mint and Treasury last week unveiled plans to issue a 24-carat commemorative coin depicting Lady Liberty as an African-American woman. With full lips and braided hair tied back in a bun, her gold-embossed profile is framed by the words “LIBERTY” above and “In God We Trust” below. “As we as a nation continue to evolve,” said Elisa Basnight, the Mint’s chief of staff, “so does Liberty’s representation.”\\nSadly, the representation is evolving far faster than the nation. The coin is worth $100 (£80); in 2010 the median net wealth for women of colour was calculated at just $5. Black women now earn 65 cents for every $1 made by a white man – the same gap as 20 years ago. So the Treasury has produced a coin in these women’s image that most cannot afford – because the economy is producing low-wage jobs that leave them with liberty without equality. For the past eight years American liberals have gorged themselves on symbolism. A significant section of the population, including those most likely to support Barack Obama, have felt better about their country even as they have fared worse in it. The young, good-looking, intact, scandal-free black family in the White House embodied a hopeful future for America and beyond. Photogenic, with an understated chic, here were people of colour who looked even better in black and white. With personal stories of progress without privilege, they provided Camelot without the castle: evoking a sense of possibility in a period of economic stagnation, social immobility and political uncertainty. As Obama passes the keys and the codes to Donald Trump at the end of this week, so many liberals mourn the passing of what has been, remain in a state of disbelief for what has happened, and express deep anxiety about what is to come. It is a steep cliff – politically, rhetorically and aesthetically – from the mocha-complexioned consensual intellectual to the permatanned, “pussy-grabbing” vulgarian. But there is a connection between the “new normal” and the old that must be understood if resistance in the Trump era is going to amount to more than Twitter memes driven by impotent rage and fuelled by flawed nostalgia. This transition is not simply a matter of sequence – one bad president following a good one – but consequence: one horrendous agenda made possible by the failure of its predecessor. It is easy for liberals to despise Trump. He is a thin-skinned charlatan, a self-proclaimed sexual harasser, a blusterer and a bigot. One need not exhaust any moral energy in making the case against his agenda. That is precisely what makes it so difficult to understand his appeal. Similarly, it is easy for liberals to love Obama. He’s measured, thoughtful, smart and eloquent – and did some good things despite strong opposition from Republicans. That is precisely what makes it so difficult for liberals to provide a principled and plausible critique of his presidency. One cannot blame Obama for Trump. It was the Republicans – craven to the mob within their base, which they have always courted but ultimately could not control – that nominated and, for now, indulges him. And yet it would be disingenuous to claim Trump rose from a vacuum that bore no relationship to the previous eight years.\\nSome of that relationship is undeniably tied up in who Obama is: a black man, with a lapsed Muslim father from Kenya. That particular constellation of identities was like catnip to an increasingly strident wing of the Republican party in a time of war, migration and racial tumult. Trump did not invent racism. Indeed, race-baiting has been a staple of Republican party strategy for more than 50 years. But as he refused to observe the electoral etiquette of the Nixon strategy (“You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,” Richard Nixon told his chief-of-staff, HR Haldeman. “The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to”), his campaign descended into a litany of brazen racist taunts. Racism’s role should not be underplayed, but its impact can arguably be overstated. While Trump evidently emboldened existing racists, it’s not obvious that he created new ones. He received the same proportion of the white vote as Mitt Romney in 2012 and George W Bush in 2004. It does not follow that because Trump’s racism was central to his meaning for liberals, it was necessarily central to his appeal for Republicans. There is a deeper connection, however, between Trump’s rise and what Obama did – or rather didn’t do – economically. He entered the White House at a moment of economic crisis, with Democratic majorities in both Houses and bankers on the back foot. Faced with the choice of preserving the financial industry as it was or embracing far-reaching reforms that would have served the interests of those who voted for him, he chose the former.\\nJust a couple of months into his first term he called a meeting of banking executives. “The president had us at a moment of real vulnerability,” one of them told Ron Suskind in his book Confidence Men. “At that point, he could have ordered us to do just about anything and we would have rolled over. But he didn’t – he mostly wanted to help us out, to quell the mob.” People lost their homes while bankers kept their bonuses and banks kept their profits. In 2010 Damon Silvers of the independent congressional oversight panel told Treasury officials: “We can either have a rational resolution to the foreclosure crisis, or we can preserve the capital structure of the banks. We can’t do both.” They chose the latter. Not surprisingly, this was not popular. Three years into Obama’s first term 58% of the country – including an overwhelming majority of Democrats and independents – wanted the government to help stop foreclosures. His Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, did the opposite, setting up a programme that would “foam the runway” for the banks. So when Hillary Clinton stood for Obama’s third term, the problem wasn’t just a lack of imagination: it was that the first two terms had not lived up to their promise. This time last year, fewer than four in 10 were happy with Obama’s economic policies. When asked last week to assess progress under Obama 56% of Americans said the country had lost ground or stood still on the economy, while 48% said it had lost ground on the gap between the rich and poor – against just 14% who said it gained ground. These were the Obama coalition – black and young and poor – who did not vote in November, making Trump’s victory possible. Those whose hopes are not being met: people more likely to go to the polls because they are inspired about a better future than because they fear a worse one. Naturally, Trump’s cabinet of billionaires will do no better and will, in all likelihood, do far worse. And even as we protest about the legitimacy of the “new normal”, we should not pretend it is replacing something popular or effective. The old normal was not working. The premature nostalgia for the Obamas in the White House is not a yearning for Obama’s policies. As any recipient of the new coin will tell you, there’s a difference between things that look different and make you feel good, and things that make a difference and actually do good. Symbols should not be dismissed as insubstantial; but nor should they be mistaken for substance.', 'If and when Donald Trump’s administration executes on his deportation strategy, immigration advocates are starting to formulate a plan. The resistance movement in Austin, Texas, centers on a diminutive reverend ready to create a physical barrier between undocumented migrants and immigration enforcement agents.\\nWhen agents arrive at the door, undocumented immigrants can call for help and one or more US citizens will quickly arrive to stand in front of the door, watching, challenging and filming law enforcement with the goal of ensuring constitutional rights are respected and encouraging a media spotlight. “We have kind of a canned spiel that one person just keeps repeating,” said Babs Miller, a minister at St Andrew’s Presbyterian Church in Austin: “‘I am a trained and certified immigration observer, notice has been given that there’s an incident to be observed, do you have a search warrant, may I see it please?’” Miller is part of the Sanctuary in the Streets initiative, which aims to frustrate immigration raids – an enforcement strategy that was used to target Central American families by the Obama administration last year and is expected to be a feature of the next president’s term. Activists in Austin and elsewhere are seeking to publicise and expand on methods that were developed in recent years during the White House tenure of the man activists derisively dubbed “deporter-in-chief”. “We’re trying to respond now to the threat of the Trump administration and the possibility that it will get even more severe than it has been,” said Sofia Casini, immigration programmes coordinator for Grassroots Leadership, an anti-mass incarceration group that announced its upcoming plans at a press conference in Austin on Monday. Trump has pledged to remove up to 3 million undocumented immigrants quickly. “I think that we should take him at face value; everything that he says we should believe,” Carmen Zuvieta, of the ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] Out of Austin group, said through a translator. A mother of three, her husband was deported to Mexico four years ago. Unless they have a warrant signed by a judge, ICE employees are not allowed to enter homes without permission. Last January’s high-profile sweeps in several states including Texas prompted advocate groups to urge undocumented immigrants to know their rights and not to open their doors to federal officials. Miller said that there are more than 100 volunteers trained so far, organised according to city council district to make response times quicker. Training takes four hours. “Our goal is to train at least 500 in the next month or so,” she said. The intent is to extend the hotline from four to eight hours a day and cards are being handed out – one side in Spanish, the other in English. They advise: “NO ABRA LA PUERTA” (Don’t open the door) and provide migrants with a spiel if agents arrive: “I do not wish to speak with you, answer your questions, or sign or hand you any documents based on my fifth amendment rights under the United States constitution”.\\nOn average, according to Grassroots Leadership, 19 Austin-based immigrants are deported per week. With an estimated 1.5 million undocumented immigrants, Texas has the second-largest such population in the country, behind California, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Most have lived in the state for more than a decade. Miller’s interest in the cause grew when her church gave sanctuary last February to two Guatemalans, Hilda Ramirez and her son, Ivan. They are still living there but gained relief from deportation in October, which allows them to leave the building without fear of being detained. A growing number of US churches are expected to open their doors to undocumented immigrants in the coming months in the knowledge that ICE policy discourages enforcement operations in “sensitive locations” such as places of worship. “People of privilege have a responsibility and obligation to do this for folks who don’t have that privilege, and I know what it’s like to not have that privilege because I am a lesbian and there was a time when I could not wear this collar. So I understand,” Miller said. “And it was because of people who could wear the collar and their allies that I can, and I have a responsibility to pay that back; to pay it forward.” Families in Austin are also being encouraged to prepare binders with personal information such as forms of identification, marriage certificates, power of attorney letters and character references. If someone is detained, family members can then quickly provide attorneys with details that could speed a release on bond and may help gain quicker access to financial assets if the main breadwinner is in custody. City leaders have offered some encouragement. In common with several other Democratic-leaning cities, Austin intends to use tax dollars to help fund legal defences for immigrants. And the new sheriff of Travis County (which includes Austin), Sally Hernandez, is a Democrat who ran on a platform of ending compliance with ICE requests to hold people who have been detained by local law enforcement for an extra 48 hours so they can be picked up by federal immigration authorities. But politicians in Texas’s Republican-dominated legislature are set to debate a bill that would eliminate “sanctuary cities” that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The proposal has the support of the governor, Greg Abbott.', 'The inauguration of a US president is normally a moment of great hope. It is a celebration of representative democracy and the peaceful transfer of power. It is an affirmation that the ideals and laws set out in the 1787 US constitution, still a global paradigm for modern-day governance, continue to be honoured and observed. Inauguration confers legitimacy on a head of state in the name of “we, the people”. The incumbent has a duty to respect and uphold the constitution’s central aims, namely “to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty”. The inauguration this Friday of Donald Trump as 45th US president is not a normal moment. Nor for the majority of Americans who did not vote for him, and countless onlookers around the globe, is it a moment of hope. Rather, Trump’s ascent to what is commonly termed the world’s most powerful job is a moment of dread, anxiety and great foreboding. We said, after he won the Republican nomination last summer, that Trump has shown himself unfit to be president. His often-demonstrated ignorance, racial bigotry, misogyny, untruthfulness, hostility to free speech, crude bullying and dangerous, rabble-rousing nationalism utterly disqualify him. Nothing has occurred since Trump narrowly won last November’s election, despite polling nearly three million fewer votes than the Democrats’ Hillary Clinton, to alter this unhappy conclusion. The president-elect’s press conference last week failed to justify hopes that the imminent, awesome responsibilities of office would moderate his reckless behaviour. In a matter of minutes, he slandered America’s intelligence agencies, threatened Mexico, vowed again to build a border wall, pistol-whipped US businesses that invest abroad, took a wrecking ball to Obamacare, pilloried unfavoured news organisations, and boasted about a shady $2bn business deal. This is not the behaviour of a president. Although only days away from the Oval Office, Trump continues to blurt out half-baked opinions on sensitive issues, like a bar-room boor. He appears not to think before he opens his mouth or his Twitter account. And what pops out is usually offensive, inflammatory or inaccurate, exemplified by last week’s insulting of Meryl Streep. Hopefully, speechwriters more sensible than he will craft his inaugural address. Friday’s ceremony is a momentous occasion. It will be watched around the world. It is a showcase for America. Yet Trump is an embarrassment. His elevation is a national humiliation. Few will enjoy this gross spectacle more than Vladimir Putin, Russia’s messianic president, and his plausibly deniable teams of cyberhackers, conspirators, fake newsmen and skilled muddiers of pools. Russia’s election interference on Trump’s behalf, publicly certified by the Obama administration and all the US intelligence agencies, has cast a dark shadow. The release last week of an unverified dossier alleging Russian contacts with Trump’s campaign staff and the gathering of blackmail material against him has intensified fears that Moscow is still trying, directly or indirectly, to manipulate the president-elect, by exploiting his inexperience, vanity and naive view of Putin. Trump has flatly denied the dossier’s allegations in his customary, choleric way. But his narcissism, when combined with his visceral hatred of Barack Obama’s foreign policy and his susceptibility to flattery, makes him a vulnerable target. Putin calmly repudiated the dossier, refusing to be drawn into the dispute, just as he refused to react to Obama’s expulsion of Russian diplomats over the election scandal. Russia’s leader is plainly expecting political payback in the form of an early summit with Trump. Only then may his real objectives become clear, including perhaps the lifting of US sanctions over Ukraine, acquiescence in Russia’s annexation of Crimea, a free hand in Syria and a Nato pullback in eastern Europe. Meanwhile, Putin can sit back and enjoy the unprecedented confusion and disarray in Washington that his covert activities helped engender. Yet for much of the confusion attending the transition, Trump alone is to blame. He often stresses his experience as a business leader and decision-maker. But decisive leadership has been alarmingly lacking amid the conflicting policy approaches promoted by his most senior nominees. Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil oilman improbably tapped for secretary of state, said last week the US would, in effect, besiege fortified islands Beijing has illegally created in the South China Sea. There is no doubt that the islands are a problem. But threatening to expel the Chinese by military force is not a sensible way to address it. This latest provocation follows Trump’s incendiary, off-the-cuff comments about Taiwan. Little wonder Chinese state media are warning of a coming war with the US. The impression that Trump and his top advisers have little idea what they are doing and scant grasp of key issues has strengthened, rather than receded, as the transition has chaotically unravelled. Trump says the CIA are behaving like Nazis. Mike Pompeo, his nominee for CIA director, lavishes praise on the agency and pledges to investigate the same dossier that Trump dismissed out of hand. While Trump’s sons, acolytes and lawyers insist their billionaire daddy-boss will avoid conflicts of interest, Ben Carson, his choice as housing tsar, refuses to rule out the possibility of millions of dollars in federal grants benefitting Trump’s real estate empire. A former general, James Mattis, slated to become defence secretary, revealed even bigger contradictions. Far from endorsing Trump’s ideas about enhanced future collaboration with Russia, Mattis identified Putin as a powerful foe intent on destroying Nato. It was vital, he said, that “we recognise the reality of what we [are dealing] with with Mr Putin”. Russia had chosen the role of strategic adversary and the US must be prepared to confront it. Mattis also declared Russian forces had committed war crimes in Syria, a view shared by the Obama administration, Britain and the UN, but one that has not been endorsed by Trump. Add to that Tillerson’s separate comments that Russia should be punished for “invading” Crimea and policy towards Moscow looks more than merely confused. As with China, it looks like Trump is spoiling for a fight. Well, is he? The fact is, nobody knows – and that includes a lazy, muddled and largely clueless Trump himself. Spouting prejudices, selling slogans and making it up as you go along may work on the campaign trail. But it will not do in the White House. Even if all Trump’s numerous inadequacies and sordid personal baggage were set to one side, his egregious lack of coherent, fact-based, rational and cooperative policy platforms, especially internationally, is potentially disastrous. Look again at what the US constitution demands: justice, tranquillity, liberty, common defence and the common good. All these principles are in peril. As the Trump era begins, a more imperfect disunion is the dismal prospect.', 'His denials – at least some of them – were emphatic, even by the standards that Donald Trump has come to be judged by. The dossier, he said, was a confection of lies; he compared it to Nazi propaganda; it was fake news spread by sick people. At his press briefing on Wednesday, the president-elect dared the world’s media to scrutinise the 35 pages of claims, before throwing down a challenge – where’s the proof? Nobody had any. Case closed. But in the rush to trample all over the dossier and its contents, one key question remained. Why had America’s intelligence agencies felt it necessary to provide a compendium of the claims to Barack Obama and Trump himself? And the answer to that lies in the credibility of its apparent author, the ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele, the quality of the sources he has, and the quality of the people who were prepared to vouch for him. In all these respects, the 53-year-old is in credit.\\nOn Thursday night, as the former spy was in hiding, having fled his home in the south-east of England, former colleagues rallied to defend him. One described him as “very credible” – a sober, cautious and meticulous professional with a formidable record. The former Foreign Office official, who has known Steele for 25 years and considers him a friend, said: “The idea his work is fake or a cowboy operation is false – completely untrue. Chris is an experienced and highly regarded professional. He’s not the sort of person who will simply pass on gossip.” The official added: “If he puts something in a report, he believes there’s sufficient credibility in it for it to be worth considering. Chris is a very straight guy. He could not have survived in the job he was in if he had been prone to flights of fancy or doing things in an ill-considered way.” That is the way the CIA and the FBI, not to mention the British government, regarded him, too. It’s not hard to see why. A Cambridge graduate, Steele was one of the more eminent Russia specialists for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). The Guardian understands that he focused on Soviet affairs after joining the agency, and spent two years living in Moscow in the early 1990s. This was a period when Russia and the breakup of the eastern bloc were still the prime focus for Britain’s intelligence agencies, and a successful spell in the region was a good way to get on. By all accounts, that’s exactly what Steele did. And his interest in Russia did not diminish as he continued to rise up the ranks, a friend and contemporary of Alex Younger – now head of MI6.\\nOver a career that spanned more than 20 years, Steele performed a series of roles, but always appeared to be drawn back to Russia; he was, sources say, head of MI6’s Russia desk. When the agency was plunged into panic over the poisoning of its agent Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, the then chief, Sir John Scarlett, needed a trusted senior officer to plot a way through the minefield ahead – so he turned to Steele. It was Steele, sources say, who correctly and quickly realised that Litvinenko’s death was a Russian state “hit”. As good as he was, Steele was unlikely to get the top MI6 job, perhaps because his specialisms were not a priority in that period – Russian espionage was taking a back seat to Islamic terrorism and non-state threats. And, of course, there is money to be made in the private sector – lots of it, particularly in the past two years. He decided to quit the service in 2009.\\nAs the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, exerted influence in all kinds of spheres, so Steele’s background made him hot property. Though he could not travel to Russia, he appears to have maintained his contacts and made new ones, using old-school techniques: going out, meeting people, shaking hands, making friends – and paying for information. With his business partner, Chris Burrows, he set up the London-based company Orbis Business Intelligence, which was busy and expanding. Their operation would have been a good choice for anyone trying to gather intelligence about Russia and Trump. It is unlikely that Steele would have had direct contact with the unnamed Kremlin officials who allegedly gave sensitive information on the president-elect. In fact, it’s believed the former spy hasn’t been able to visit Russia for more than 20 years. Rather, Steele would have tapped up his network of sources deep inside the country, some of them dating from his time there and others cultivated later, British officials suggested. In turn, these individuals will have had sources of their own. Steele would likely have subcontracted some of his Trump investigation to trusted intermediaries in Moscow, who will have reported back to him via secure channels.\\nThis method of intelligence collection may explain the odd language anomaly in the Trump dossier that emerged into the public eye late on Tuesday. In a September briefing note, Steele mentions the Alpha-Group, a reference to the consortium headed by the powerful oligarch Mikhail Fridman. The more usual English spelling is Alfa. Almost certainly, a native Russian speaker wrote the original material, correctly transliterating the Russian “f” as “ph”. It was Steele’s job to collate, evaluate and verify this material before passing it to his American client Fusion GPS, a Washington-based political research firm. The company had been hired originally by one of Trump’s early Republican opponents before the contract was taken up by senior Democrats. The Foreign Office official who spoke to the Guardian on Thursday acknowledged that the Steele dossier was not perfect. But he pointed out that intelligence reports always came with “gradations of veracity” and included phrases such as “a high degree of probability”. “You aren’t dealing with a binary world where you can say this is true and this isn’t,” the official said. He added: “The strongest reason for giving this report credence is that intelligence professionals in the US take it seriously. They were sufficiently persuaded by the author’s track record to find the contents worth passing to the president and president-elect.”\\nThe CIA and FBI will have taken various factors into consideration before deciding on its credibility. They could include Trump’s public comments during the campaign, when he urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails. The agencies may also have classified, intercepted material provided by the National Security Agency and Britain’s GCHQ. They must, equally, have considered whether some of the claims in the report might have been part of an elaborate Russian disinformation exercise. “This is unlikely. The dossier is multi-dimensional, involving many different people, and many moving parts,” the official suggested. Steele’s personal views on Russia are unlikely to be very different from those of his former employers – or from those of a former UK ambassador to Moscow who is understood to have passed the dossier to the Republican senator John McCain, who in turn passed it to the FBI. MI6 has been privately warning that Putin, unchallenged by the west, has grown in confidence and, of course, that the Kremlin has targeted Trump. It would be odd if it hadn’t. The consensus among British securocrats is that “Putin is a wolf … and he preys on the weakest sheep.” But intelligence is not evidence, and Steele would have known, better than anyone, that the information he was gathering was not fact and could be wrong. In the smoke-and-mirrors world of counterespionage, there are few certainties. Those caveats do not appear on the documents – but they are given by Steele as a warning to prospective new clients.\\nWhether he could have imagined that a summary of his work would be used in this way is a moot point; Steele did not go to ground in the weeks before Christmas as US media outlets tried to stand up some of the claims against Trump. He was in London, thinking about where to take Orbis next, eating his favourite tapas and pottering around Victoria, the home of his newly refurbished office. From Moscow’s perspective, the report’s publication can hardly be counted as a success. As a former KGB agent, Putin understands the first rule of intelligence: that special operations should remain secret. “In the world in which Putin operates, if people can see the strings, you’ve failed,” the Foreign Office official said. “The Russians will be asking: ‘How the hell did it get out?’” The spotlight is certainly not something Steele was looking for. He is mainly distrustful of the media – he chooses who to speak to, having been let down, so he has confided to friends, by reporters working for a Sunday newspaper. After a career in MI6, anonymity is something he has prized. He once asked a journalist if he had ever heard of him. The reporter’s reply was a decisive no. Steele was relieved: “That’s the way I like it.” Now that his cover has been blown, his next steps are uncertain. The fact that Steele is a British citizen and an outed former MI6 officer makes him relatively secure from any act of Russian revenge. At the moment, the situation may look bleak for Steele. But things can change. “This will eventually blow over,” Steele’s friend said. “What you are left with is a effective marketing campaign. He’s a very sober guy, but he also has a sense of humour.”', 'Headline: Towering Trump – the tycoon is big on himself and it has paid handsomely, but what can he do for the people? He sits entirely still, impassive, not a muscle moving, not a wrinkle in his perfect appearance, his face as pressed as his suit. He mesmerises his prey like a snake about to strike. For underneath that stillness is a demonic power and energy waiting to spring. Donald Trump is New York. Glitz, greed, glamour and an ambition so colossal that it will probably not rest until he rules the world – which one day he just might. At 41 he owns vast chunks of Manhattan’s prime real estate, the best hotels, the biggest casinos in Atlantic City, huge realms in Palm Beach and much more. He is the toughest, the fastest, operator in the city, and probably, says his biography, the world. He’s as sharp as a gold-plated razor-blade. He sells himself, like everything belonging to him, very big indeed. Now his autobiography is America’s bestselling book for the last five years. It has been number one on the bestseller list since December and his London publishers are reprinting already, in publication week. He boasts that other tycoons’ books don’t sell. ‘And I want you to know I wrote this book, I myself,’ he says. But what of Tony Schwartz, his literary collaborator? There is something odd about it, for Tony Schwartz, a contributing editor at New York Magazine, is the writer who wrote a great front cover expose of one of Trump’s harsher deals which involved the attempted winkling of tenants in a block Trump wanted to redevelop. In the book this incident is seen in quite another light. How did Schwartz turn poacher? Trump gives just the faintest hint of a shrug, not enough to disorder the cut of his shoulders. ‘He has a business ability,’ he explains, which has a ring of truth in it. ‘He catches the cadence of my voice.’ Sitting in the foyer before the interview, his high-powered PA has just told me that she wants me to know that: ‘Mr Trump is a genuine human being. He is a warm and caring person.’ He tells me too how much he does for charity. Indeed, he does. The whole of New York society and much of business operates around charity. It is the instant way in for the parvenu. What’s good about New York is there is no such thing as new money. Money is just money, without the need to launder it for a couple of generations. You don’t have to join the Freemasons you just buy into Dollars 10,000 a plate dinners for Cerebral Palsy or restoration of the Cathedral of St John the Divine.\\nHis book, Trump: The Art Of The Deal, is a fascinating read. It is the story, (or more probably, a very small part of the story) of how he made it. It describes the deals in which he always comes out top. Even when he seems to lose, at the last minute he comes out the winner. It is flamboyantly exuberant and it offers the illusion that it’s easy. It seems to tell you how it’s done. It turns the entrepreneur into a modern hero, a Wild West pioneer, a conquistador, a Cecil Rhodes, told like the Edwardians wrote of the empire-builders for schoolboy hero-worshippers. There are no values but victory, no goals beyond winning. Trump titillates the greed nerves without shame or doubt. In Britain this will be seen as a rivetting curiosity from an alien culture. It is exactly what we think of New York. It will satisfy our sense of moral superiority and old-world decency. It makes our new spirit of entrepreneurialism look a poor pale bloodless thing. This week it was reviewed by John Harvey-Jones, one of our most distinguished and successful industrialists. He looked down on Trump with a witty, amused, and very British distaste. Trump read the review with some puzzlement. In one deal in the book, Trump describes the handshake with a real old-world gentleman – a handshake that cost the poor gentleman a lot of new world money. Harvey-Jones pulls out this incident as an emblem of Trump’s style of doing business. ‘I didn’t understand that,’ Trump said, aggrieved. ‘I really respected that honorable man. I respect a man of his word for whom a handshake is enough.’ But, I point out, it was his honour that did him in on this deal. ‘Look, that honorable man is a millionaire a hundred times over, and he’s made more money than your Harvey-Jones ever has, so what does he know? Your country’s distaste for success is a national disease.’ The whole point of the book and its remarkable adventures is that when each deal is struck someone loses out badly. ‘That’s wheeling and dealing,’ he says with a faint smile. He lives in the top three floors of Trump Tower, his first great Manhattan development, a magnificent mirror-glass 68-floor monument to showy flamboyance. It has a gigantic rose-marbled atrium and huge green trees growing up platforms on its facade hundreds of feet up in the sky. His wife, Ivana, is an ex-Olympic skier, ex-model, something of a Trump tower herself, famed for her astounding couture wardrobe. She runs some of his hotels and casinos with a rod of iron that is lovingly admired in the book. It is said that for tax purposes he gives her only a dollar a year, and all the dresses she can buy. Most of his book, and his reputation is built on the property deals he started out with. Now the greatest part of his wealth comes from his many casinos.\\nSo what do you do when you’re only 41 and you have made more money than you could ever spend? He is lionised in a city of lions. People try to touch him in the street, as if some of the gold might come off, the Man with the Midas Fist. ‘What else is there?’ he asks. ‘It’s all a game. I’m young, and I’m just coming up to the best part.’ Maybe now, I naively suggest, he can apply his talents to solving the appalling problems of the city he half owns? Even as his ten million dollar apartments multiply, just around the corner is the West’s worst squalor, danger, decay and disgrace. If he’s looking for new challenges, they are all around him. He has, after all, just taken on the renovation of the Wollman Ice Skating Rink in Central Park, which had run into such catastrophic problems under mismanagement by the city council. He couldn’t bear to watch it out of his window, so he did it himself, to resounding applause and adulation. Had that given him a taste for taking on New York’s disaster areas? ‘Challenges?’ he said. As people always do, I had underestimated the scope of his ambition. It certainly wasn’t centred on solving New York’s housing crisis. ‘I hate what’s happening to this country,’ he says, with a trace of fervour. ‘We’re getting kicked around by the Japanese, and they’re making the United States look foolish. Our politicians don’t know what they’re doing. Japan is shaming us out of our dignity. They are buying up everything. So is Europe and the United States is becoming the whipping post of its allies.’ So the carefully placed rumours are true, Donald J Trump does want to stand for President? The faintest of smiles: ‘Not for a period but I am involved politically. You could do it from where I am.’ It is said he once said: ‘If I want to be President, then I’ll be President.’\\nHe is beginning now to sound approximately like a politician. What would his platform be? ‘Respect,’ he says and pauses heavily. ‘Respect.’ He sounds like the Godfather. ‘We’re a second rate economic power, a debtor nation. We’re getting kicked around.’ I try to imagine the kind of deals he would make with Gorbachev, and fail. I choose an issue. What would he do about Iran, for instance? ‘I’d be harsh on Iran. They’ve been beating us psychologically, making us look a bunch of fools. One bullet shot at one of our men or ships and I’d do a number on Kharg Island. I’d go in and take it. Iran can’t even beat Iraq, yet they push the United States around. It’d be good for the world to take them on.’ He is enough of a politician to be polite about George Bush. He says, politely, that the man is not such a wimp as he’s made out. Bush has been unfairly traduced by the media. But he says it in a way that makes it plain Bush is still a wimp. Could Trump possibly make it to the White House? Of course not, says everyone who knows anything about American politics. It’s a bad joke. But then Trump has often done what can’t be done and if the White House can take a senile movie star, why not a casino operator? Trump’s is not a rags to riches story. His father was a small time low-rent developer in Queens. But Donald Trump did not enjoy rent-collecting in areas where you had to stand the right side of the door in order not to get shot. But his father gave him the basic skills, taught him about building, and contractors, buying and selling. He was sent to the New York Military Academy, where he came out captain of the cadets of his year. He went to Wharton School of Finance, where he is now in the Hall of Fame, but says the degree was only useful in impressing people with his respectable credentials. He put together his first deals by sheer bravado. He had nothing, no office, a tiny shabby apartment, but daring and brashness of breathtaking scope, with promises and other people’s money. What is he doing here in London? Certainly not promoting his book, since he agreed to only two interviews. Is he going to buy us up, too? ‘It’s a great city. It’s beginning to generate some new energy. I’m looking. If the right opportunity comes along, I’ll make a move.’', 'Trump’s first press conference since July made plenty of news. He acknowledged Russia’s role in the Democratic National Committee hack for the first time, elaborately sidestepped traditional conflict-of-interest rules and announced a new cabinet nomination. Yet the most shocking moments came not with policy pronouncements, but in his handling of the assembled media itself. His pointed, public attacks on journalists during the press conference were a tactic ripped from the playbook of authoritarian regimes around the world. Their goal is to discredit the media and undermine journalists’ ability to play their crucial role in holding government accountable. The conference began with Trump press secretary-designate Sean Spicer deriding as “outrageous and highly irresponsible” Buzzfeed’s decision to publish an uncorroborated dossier alleging, among other things, Russian interference involving the president-elect and top campaign aides. Spicer also impugned as “pathetic” and “sad” CNN, which declined to publish the dossier but ran a more general story indicating that US intelligence agencies had conveyed to Trump and to President Barack Obama reports of the Russian government holding compromising information about Trump.\\nTrump and his team were well within their rights to vociferously and even angrily rebut unverified reports that were highly damaging to the president-elect. But they didn’t stop there. Once Trump took the podium, CNN reporter Jim Acosta made persistent attempts to ask a question, calling out that having been attacked by name, the network ought to have the right to pose a query. Trump spurned Acosta menacingly, saying “not you,” “your organization is terrible,” and “you are fake news.” He referred to Buzzfeed as a “failing pile of garbage.” Acosta reports that he was then told by Spicer that if he tried again to ask a question he would be thrown out of the press conference.\\nThis was hardly Trump’s first offensive against a journalist. On the campaign trail, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos was ejected from a Trump news conference. And the candidate’s well-publicized feud with then-Fox anchor Megyn Kelly helped launch her into superstardom. But as Trump morphs from candidate to commander-in-chief, his attacks on the press take on a far more dangerous and far-reaching power. The specter of a president attacking journalists who ask nettlesome questions or expose corruption is nothing new. It happens all over the world in authoritarian countries where leaders brook no dissent. Journalists who don’t toe the line are derided as incompetent, politically-motivated or seditious. Rather than conclusively rebutting unwelcome reporting, these leaders undermine the source. Aimed to intimidate and silence, these tactics can be highly effective, training the press to comply with a set of implicit rules that, after a while, no longer need active enforcement. In the most tyrannical countries, including Iran, Cuba and Russia, only a handful of journalists are in jail because most others have simply stopped writing stories that could risk their lives and freedom. Turkey’s Tayyip Recep Erdoğan is currently the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, whom he has branded “agents of subversion,” “foreign spies,” and terrorists.\\nVietnam’s prime minister has dismissed revelations of party corruption as “despicable stratagems by hostile forces” and pursued a policy of aggressive prosecutions of journalists and bloggers. Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei has described the country’s reform-oriented press as “a base of operations by foreign enemies inside our country.” While American presidents going back to Theodore Roosevelt have mostly made a point of wooing the media, the one exception is, unsurprisingly, Richard Nixon. When LA Times reporter Stuart Loory wrote about how much the president’s vacation home had cost taxpayers, Nixon had his staff bar him from the White House. In 1969, Vice President Agnew derided the media writ large as “impudent snobs.” Trump’s return to Nixonian tactics of media send an alarming signal as we prepare to inaugurate an administration that has already signalled its contempt for ethics scrutiny and conflict of interest norms and disregard for the work of our intelligence agencies. There’s no law that says the president must take questions from the press. It’s just a long-held practice. If Trump opts to draw the curtains, offering selective peeks only to designated sycophants, he could well establish a new normal that might govern for years to come, not just in the White House, but also the Congress, the State Houses and the corporate boardrooms. Thomas Jefferson who once remarked “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter.” Trump might well answer that question differently. It is up to the press and to the American public to ensure that this is a choice he never gets to make.', 'China suffered a sharp drop in exports last year and there are fears its trading position will weaken further in 2017 with repercussions for the global economy if Donald Trump’s protectionist policies prompt a trade war. A week before the billionaire’s inauguration as US president, Chinese authorities expressed their concern that Trump would follow through on pledges to impose high tariffs on imports from China and to brand the country a currency manipulator. The president-elect has long maintained that China has been devaluing its currency in order to make its exports more competitive on overseas markets.\\nBeijing’s worries come against the backdrop of a slowdown in trade with figures on Friday showing exports fell for the second year running in 2016, dropping by 7.7% – the biggest fall since 2009 – with imports falling by 5.5%. The weaker than expected performance added to concerns that global demand is slowing in a climate of heightened political uncertainty and social tensions. The World Bank warned this week that a tentative pickup in the global economy is at risk from the uncertainty unleashed by Brexit and the arrival of Trump in the White House. There was also a note of caution on growth prospects from the World Economic Forum, which said before its annual meeting in Davos next week that rising income inequality posed a risk to the global economy in 2017. Policymakers and investors are waiting to see which of Trump’s campaign trail pledges he will seek to push through after being sworn in on 20 January. He fought Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on an anti-globalisation platform with a pledge to bring jobs back to America that he claimed had been lost to China and other countries. China’s customs agency expressed its worries on Friday. “The trend of anti-globalisation is becoming increasingly evident, and China is the biggest victim of this trend,” customs spokesman Huang Songping told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. “We will pay close attention to foreign trade policy after Trump is inaugurated president.” Experts said part of China’s trade slowdown in 2016 was down to a deliberate push to rebalance away from an exports-driven economy. “Some of the decline is expected and intended,” said Kamel Mellahi, professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School.\\n“The focus on the domestic market, recent anti-pollution measures and supply-side policies, combined with the sluggish international demand for Chinese goods, are all having a negative impact on export.” Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said he saw little prospect of China’s trade position improving in the near future, partly thanks to tepid global growth. “It’s hard to see conditions becoming much more favourable to Chinese trade than they already are. Further upside to economic activity, both in China and abroad, is probably now limited given declines in trend growth,” he said. “The risks to trade lie to the downside – the likelihood of a damaging trade spat between China and the US has risen in recent weeks following Trump’s appointment of hardliners to lead US trade policy.” Brian Davidson, US economist at Fathom Consulting, emphasised the potential costs to businesses in China and to American consumers if Trump’s deal-making with the vast Asian economy turned sour. “We think Mr Trump is set to renegotiate the US trade relationship with China and the stakes are high: US exporters could lose access to the world’s second largest economy; and US consumers might be deprived of the hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods that they buy from China each year,” he said. Reasons to worry about the global economy in 2017 China’s slowdown in exports is just one factor behind a cautious outlook for global growth in 2017. Economists are also pointing to: The US central bank raising interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs in December 2015 and December 2016 and has signalled more increases to come this year. On the one hand, that is a vote of confidence in the world’s biggest economy. On the other, there are worries that the moves will heap pressures on emerging market economies. When US rates go up, emerging market assets become less attractive and investors shift their money elsewhere for higher returns. At the same time, higher US rates tend to increase the value of the dollar and that inflates the dollar-denominated debts of emerging market countries.\\nA new US president with a protectionist stance. Trump has China in his sights as well as Mexico and other big US trading partners. He has announced his intention to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and has said he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. There are worries the protectionist mood will spread beyond America with inward-looking politicians such as France’s Marine Le Pen gaining ground against a backdrop of growing discontent at inequality. But, in the near-term, many forecasters see a potential economic boost from Trump taking over, given his pledge to beef up state spending and cut taxes in the world’s largest economy. Political uncertainty is high. It is not just Trump’s arrival in the White House that is concerning investors. The UK’s Brexit talks kick off this year and there are key elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Added to that are geopolitical tensions stemming from Russia and elsewhere so economists therefore see plenty of reasons that 2017 could again disappoint for global growth. Climate change risks. The World Economic Forum has ranked this as the second biggest risk it sees for this year behind rising income and wealth disparity. That was due in part to the increasingly frequent extreme weather that climate change heralds.', 'The Donald Trump dossier, and his response to it, dominated media coverage yesterday, thus eclipsing the farewell speech by President Barack Obama. It also meant that there has been relatively little analysis of the claims made by Obama about his achievements during his eight years in office. Among those who did, the thumbs were largely down. The speech “underlined how little he has to brag about”, said the Daily Mail. Conceding that the expectations raised by his election slogan (“Yes we can!”) were “always going to be hard to live up to”, the paper argued that his parting claim - “Yes, we did!” - rang “bitterly hollow.” Why? Because he failed to carry out his pledge to close Guantanamo Bay, which remains “an ugly stain on America’s reputation.” Obama was also “ineffectual” in “issuing empty threats against Syria, interfering disgracefully in our Brexit referendum and concluding a highly perilous nuclear deal with Iran.” Inside the US, he did “nothing to ease racial tensions, while his welfare reforms have been at best a mixed success, at worst a costly failure. As for the economic recovery, most of the credit belongs to George W Bush.” The Mail concluded that his most lasting legacy is “likely to be America’s disenchantment with its liberal elite - and the triumph of Mr Trump.” Trevor Kavanagh, writing in the Sun, saw his legacy in similar terms. It is Obama’s fault that the US now has Trump. The “cool dude” president was a representative of “the metropolitan American elite” who “showed lofty disdain for millions of ordinary, working-class Americans.”\\nHe has also left the once-mighty Democratic Party in ruins with his Republican foes now dominating Capitol Hill and giving them the power to unravel everything he stood for in office — including Obamacare. In fact, Kavanagh did believe that Obama “can claim some successes on welfare and health care.” But, having “presided over a resurgent economy, a soaring stock market and a boom in jobs”, US voters were enraged “to see the very rich get very much richer while they barely trod water.” As for race relations, “Obama’s record is at best patchy, with millions of black Americans turning their backs on the Democrats who took them for granted.” Turning to the international stage, Kavangah argued that “Obama was a failure” by preferring “to take a back seat and hope for the best.” In the Middle East, “Obama shifted from timidity to shambles” and “his reputation for dithering grew as events in Iraq, Libya and Syria left hundreds of thousands dead, the region in chaos and the western way of life under threat from an unparalleled migration crisis.” His “inactivity served to encourage bullyboy Russia to exert its influence in the region, giving it its first foothold for the first time in 40 years.” By contrast, Simon Jenkins, writing in the Guardian, thought Obama’s achievements “not inconsiderable”. He “pulled the American economy back from the brink of recession, saved the auto industry, prevented a bank collapse and put his country on the road back towards full employment.” He also “introduced a health plan that may be flawed, but should be too entrenched for its enemies to destroy” while, at the global level, “he pulled off deals with Iran and Cuba, and tried to bring an end to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.” Obama regime was also scandal-free with an admirable family. “He brought dignity, noble intent and a clear intelligence to the job”, said Jenkins. But he recognised failures too. He did not “discipline Israel or define a new relationship with Russia.” At home, he and his Democrat colleagues “left it open to Trump... to attack Wall Street and Washington’s beltway bubble... to appear on the side of the small guy.” In some ways, this argument echoed the views of the Mail and Kavanagh. Trump, it would appear, is Obama’s legacy. That seems very unfair to me. But are they correct?', 'The US vice-president, Joe Biden, has said it is “absolutely mindless” for Donald Trump not to have confidence in the intelligence community, as the heads of the US agencies prepared to present their findings on Russian election interference to the president-elect. The unprecedented dispute between Trump and the intelligence services he will soon control broke into the open at a congressional hearing on Thursday as the head of US intelligence publicly defended his analysts, who he said “stand more resolutely” than ever behind their conclusion of “Russian interference in our electoral process”.\\nBiden said it would be legitimate to question intelligence and ask for more detail or disagree but “dangerous” to publicly criticise the agencies and claim to know more than them. “For a president not to have confidence in, not to be prepared to listen to, the myriad intelligence agencies, from defence intelligence to the CIA, is absolutely mindless,” he said in an interview with PBS. “The idea that you may know more than the intelligence community knows – it’s like saying I know more about physics than my professor. I didn’t read the book, I just know I know more.” James Clapper, the departing director of national intelligence, and the heads of the CIA, NSA and FBI will brief Trump on Russian election interference in Trump Tower on Friday. It is likely to be a highly charged meeting. Ahead of it on Friday, Trump told the New York Times in a telephone interview that the focus on Russia amounted to a “political witch-hunt”. He said China had “relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names ... how come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt.” The president-elect has publicly derided the agencies on the issue, and this week cited a denial by Julian Assange of WikiLeaks that his source for Democratic party emails released during the election was the Russian government or “a state party”. Trump restated his doubts in a series of tweets on Thursday evening suggesting the FBI investigation was flawed.\\nThe report Trump will be briefed on was presented to Barack Obama earlier in the week. US intelligence officials told the Washington Post and NBC that the classified document, said to be more than 50 pages long, says intercepted communications revealed Russian intelligence officials celebrating Trump’s win. An unclassified version of the report will be published early next week, prepared by the NSA, CIA and FBI and providing additional information for the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia deliberately hacked the Democratic National Committee to aid Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The CIA has also identified the Russian officials who fed the Democratic party emails to WikiLeaks through the use of third parties, Reuters reported, which allowed Assange to say the Russian government or state agencies were not the source. Clapper told the Senate armed services committee in a hearing on Thursday into foreign cyber-threats that US intelligence analysts “stand more resolutely” than ever behind their conclusion of “Russian interference in our electoral process”. He said there was a “difference between scepticism and disparagement”. Clapper and Adm Michael Rogers, the director of the NSA, expressed concerns about intelligence analysts’ morale after Trump’s perceived disparagement of their work, with Rogers suggesting some may quit. Clapper said Russia “has clearly assumed an even more aggressive cyber posture”, and described the assault on the 2016 election as “multifaceted”. “Hacking was only one part of it,” he said. “It also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation and fake news.” Next week’s report will ascribe what Clapper called “more than one motive” to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for the electoral interference. Clapper, who has in the past signalled his discomfort with public intelligence testimony – and who has apologised for previous false statements to the Senate on the scope of domestic NSA surveillance – said he intended to “push the envelope as much as I can on the unclassified version” of the report “because I think the public should know as much of this as possible”. “They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort,” Clapper said of the Russians. He demurred from considering their intrusion an “act of war” while under questioning from the committee chairman, John McCain, saying that would be a “very heavy policy call” not an intelligence judgment, particularly since the US also penetrates foreign digital networks. Trump’s confidence in WikiLeaks has shocked and angered intelligence analysts, who consider Assange at the least a hostile actor, and at most a tool of Putin. On Thursday morning, Trump denied he was “in agreement” with Assange, tweeting: “I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth.” He claimed the media “lies to make it look like I am against ‘intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan”. The Trump transition team has sought to weaken the impact of the intelligence findings on Russia meddling in the election by highlighting the US intelligence community’s failures over Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. Clapper claimed that US intelligence collection and analysis had vastly improved since then. “We do make mistakes, but we try to learn from them and make changes,” he said, insisting that the contrast between US intelligence then and now was “the difference of night and day”. Amid the background of distrust is a plan Trump is reportedly considering to reorganise the US intelligence apparatus. According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the proposal, Trump is considering diminishing the role of the director of national intelligence and returning the CIA directorship, under Trump’s pick, Mike Pompeo, to its prime role within the intelligence community. Trump’s incoming press secretary Sean Spicer called the report “100% false”. Since Trump’s election, some career US intelligence officials have told the Guardian they fear retaliation for their assessment of Russian electoral interference. A leading figure behind the reported reorganisation is said to be Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Flynn, the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief whom Clapper fired in 2014. Clapper, who resigned in November and will leave his post when Trump is inaugurated, said the current intelligence leadership had not been consulted on the plan.', 'The last time a Republican president took office after losing the popular vote, he made it clear that ethics were his highest priority. How could we tell? At every campaign stop, George W Bush ended his stump speech by raising his right hand and promising to uphold not just the laws of the land but what he called “the honor and dignity of the office”. For good measure, he added: “So help me God.” We may all need divine intervention to defend ethics inside the new US Congress and the new Trump administration. It’s not clear why the new Republican-dominated Congress thought it was a good idea to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. But it is clear why they decided to abandon the plan: public pressure from social media and a deluge of phone calls to their offices. House Republicans apparently felt burdened by all those pesky investigations into their questionable conduct. But they couldn’t bring themselves to make that argument in public, so they voted to gut the office behind closed doors on a public holiday. Instead it was left to Kellyanne Conway, counselor to a swamp-draining president-elect, to defend the anti-ethics vote in public, telling ABC News: “There’s a mandate there for them to make significant change.”\\nFunny. The only Republican discussion of ethics through the election year was their insistence that Hillary Clinton was unqualified to be president because of her private email server. That’s even less of a mandate than President-elect Trump after losing the popular vote by almost 3 million. Conway complained, like all those oppressed members of Congress, that the ethics office suffered from “overzealousness”. “We don’t want people wrongly accused and we don’t want people mired in months if not years of ethical complaint review,” she explained. This from the campaign manager of a candidate who insisted there was a law and order crisis in America. It would be refreshing to hear Conway’s concerns about overzealous policing in US cities, or the suffering of people mired in years of criminal justice proceedings. Instead we got to hear a couple of tweets from her boss, who also criticized the ethics office as “unfair” before questioning the Republicans’ priorities. For that nudge on priorities, many in the media gave Trump all the credit for the House Republicans caving on its ethics evasions. Welcome to the slippery moral slope of Trump’s Washington. A president-elect who continues to enrich his own business through the course of his presidential transition chides a new Congress over ethics. Never mind the hypocrisy and lies about “draining the swamp”. Of course Trump thinks there are other priorities than ethics. Otherwise he wouldn’t be meeting with his Indian business partners, and his new Washington hotel might not do business with foreign diplomats. He might find his treasury decisions compromised by his large debts to foreign banks, his choice of IRS commissioner compromised by his personal tax audit and his new hotel lease compromised by the fact that he is now his own landlord. This is the same slippery slope that places the publisher of far-right garbage inside the West Wing. Steve Bannon hasn’t personally written racist or antisemitic stories; he was merely the executive chairman of Breitbart which published those stories. Just as Trump isn’t really going to deport millions of undocumented immigrants this month; he merely stoked racial resentment with that promise. Back in the 1990s, conservatives called this moral relativism Slouching Towards Gomorrah. Today the Republican party is slouching towards something uncomfortably close to Moscow. For the past eight years, the Republicans have been seized by an anti-Obama fever that was supposedly rooted in a constitutional defense against an abusive president. If there was any point of agreement between all those Republican primary candidates, it was the notion that Obama had ignored the founding fathers. And yet here we are on the brink of inaugurating a president who thinks nothing of Article I of that same constitution, and its clear prohibition against the kind of foreign dealings in which Trump is so expert. As ethics experts from both the Bush and Obama administrations have written, the founders saw the so-called emoluments clause as a way to stop corruption by foreign powers. If a president accepts any gifts and benefits from foreign nations, he faces the threat of impeachment. Instead the newly elected Trump claims, wrongly, that there is nothing to prevent him from being president of the United States and CEO of his company at the same time. “In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly,” he told the New York Times. It takes real leadership to create a culture of ethics, and it takes very little leadership to destroy any semblance of ethics. It’s only natural that the House Republicans would follow Trump’s lead by treating ethics as some kind of low-priority interference with their real business: business itself. Having sworn to uphold the dignity of the presidency, George W Bush kept his promise to keep his pants on in the Oval Office, after two years of the Monica Lewinsky saga. Setting aside a catastrophic war and approving torture, he was indeed true to his family. He also never sought to profit from the presidency through the kind of private business deals so beloved in banana republics. But even Bush’s presidency was undone by unethical conduct in Congress and a House Republican party that misunderstood the notion of a mandate. After finally winning the popular vote in the upset victory of 2004, the House set itself on an anti-immigrant path that destroyed Bush’s self-proclaimed political capital. Along the way, the same Republican party was embroiled in a series of corruption scandals personified by the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. The result of those scandals was nothing less than the creation of the congressional ethics office. After serving several years in prison, Abramoff (today a supporter of ethics reforms) now condemns the same party he once courted for having misread the voters’ desire for reform in last year’s election. “I guess some people in Washington still don’t get what happened in November,” he told Politico. Single-party rule rarely ends well. Two years after Bush’s thumping re-election, Democrats took control of Capitol Hill. Two years after Obama’s historic win in 2008, Republicans took back the House. The voters’ desire for reform will not be satisfied by the survival of the congressional ethics office. And it certainly won’t be satisfied by the sight of the Trump children running the president’s businesses. If Donald Trump fails to drain his own family swamp, he will quickly discover how you can win the electoral college but lose the battle for power.', 'Over the years, Iran has sometimes played a disproportionately large part in US politics. Jimmy Carter blamed the 1979-81 embassy hostage crisis for his failure to secure a second term, and Reagan’s second term was damaged significantly by the Iran-Contra revelations. The deal secured by the Obama administration with Iran over the nuclear question in July 2015 has proved violently divisive between Democrats and Republicans. So it was no surprise that Iran surfaced again in the debate between the presidential candidates on 26 September.\\nHillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump’s maverick tendency by referring to his apparent willingness to open fire on Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf if they threw insults at US sailors. Trump hit back at Clinton for going along with Obama’s Iran policy, complaining “we lose on everything” – referring back to his theme of a US diminished by Obama’s presidency. The exchange thus summed up what each candidate saw as one of the other’s main weak points. President Rouhani of Iran can scarcely be enthusiastic about the prospects for the US presidential election. Trump has said directly that the 2015 nuclear deal was “disastrous” and he would repudiate it, doubling and tripling sanctions (quite how, he doesn’t specify) to force the Iranians to renegotiate. Clinton has supported the nuclear deal and is more likely to follow in Obama’s footsteps, but she has consistently been more hawkish on Iran than Obama. She was enthusiastic in the drive to harden sanctions on Iran in the latter part of Obama’s first term, and Iranians have not forgotten her statement during the presidential nomination contest in 2008 that the US could “totally obliterate” Iran if it were to attack Israel with a nuclear weapon – widely reported at the time as “Clinton wants to obliterate Iran”. Rouhani himself is engaged in an election campaign (the election will take place in May 2017) and, though still popular, is under increasing pressure because economic benefits from the nuclear deal have yet to reach ordinary Iranians. Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has suggested that the US has failed to honour its commitment to lift sanctions. It is an unwritten rule of Iranian politics that Iranian presidents always get a second term, but Rouhani cannot be complacent. He has to appease hardliners, which is why he avoided meeting Obama at the UN general assembly earlier in September. Since the nuclear deal, Iran has drawn closer to Russia over Syria and the US has seemed keener to mollify its ally Saudi Arabia than to explore new opportunities for a better relationship with the Iranians. Depressingly, both Iran and the US have retreated to their familiar comfort zones of mutual hostility. If Trump were elected and really were to follow an America-first policy, retreating from global commitments, conciliating Putin and allowing Russia a larger role (as he has hinted, bizarrely) then relations between states would shift in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia would be isolated (the folly of the UK’s support for Saudi Arabia in its sectarian cold war with Iran would be even more exposed) and the Iranian regime might rejoice. But Trump has also said those things about renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal, and has run an ad campaign saying he would “cut the head off Isis and take their oil”, which, though hard to construe, sounds like more intervention rather than less. If he were elected, a lot would depend on Trump’s advisers, but that is no cause for reassurance. John Bolton, whom Trump has spoken of as a possible secretary of state, said in March 2015 in the last weeks before the nuclear deal that the US could still bomb Iran, and that bombing was the only way to stop Iran getting a nuclear weapon. Another figure close to Trump, Lt Gen Michael Flynn, made a statement in July 2016 that seemed to suggest he thought Ali Khamenei’s predecessor, Ayatollah Khomeini, was still alive and in office. As many around the world look on at this election with alarm and some despondency, I remember Henry Kissinger’s infamous comment on the Iran-Iraq war – “it’s a pity they can’t both lose”. It seems to be a choice between a man whose daddy bought him a route to the top and a woman whose path was smoothed by the charm of her less intelligent husband. Broadly, in assessing the likely direction of policy under either of the two candidates, one has to expect that Trump would follow through on his rhetoric and take a hard line on Iran. Trump is plainly populist and unpredictable – an American version of Iran’s former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But even to him, a US policy initiative to tear up the nuclear deal must look like only adding to the problems of a murderously chaotic region. Clinton by contrast appears a relatively safe choice – but would that mean following the unimaginative anti-Iranian groupthink in Washington rather than exploring the opportunities that the Iran nuclear deal should have opened up? In a statement earlier in the year she spoke in all-too-familiar terms of Iran as continuing to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East, of “Iran’s negative actions in the region” and standing “side-by-side with our ally Israel and our Arab partners”. We know from Wikileaks that she believed privately in the past that Saudi Arabia was the largest source for terrorist funding worldwide, and that the Saudi government was not doing enough to stop that funding. But a more balanced view of the Saudi-Iranian confrontation has not emerged in her public utterances. Perhaps if, as the polls still indicate, Clinton wins the US presidential contest, greater political freedom of action will permit her to be more imaginative, bold and judicious in the Iran context. Let’s hope so.', 'After a year of seismic shocks comes the protest and fightback. At least that is what activists plan with the first major demonstration of the year – the women’s march – planned for 30 cities around the world on 21 January, the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration as president of the US. The women’s march on Washington has been given permission by state authorities to go ahead. Tens of thousands of women (and men, who are also welcome to join it) have already pledged to take part and plans for a sister rally in London are gaining support from writers, musicians and politicians. Organisers say the US election proved a “catalyst for a grassroots movement of women to assert the positive values that the politics of fear denies”. In the UK the Women’s Equality party has thrown its weight behind the march. “I am a dual national and voted for Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin,” said the party co-founder, Catherine Mayer. “I will march with my father, a US citizen, who during his time as a conscript in the US army came under investigation by Senator Joseph McCarthy for supposed un-American activities. In fact he was and remains a US patriot who will march to promote the values essential to the US: democracy and the human rights of the whole population,” she said. “For me the march is also important because it recognises how interconnected our world is. What happens in America impacts all of us. The rights of women and of minority populations and vulnerable and low-income people are under threat and we must do everything we can to protect these rights and fight for true equality.” Musician Pixie Geldof, writer Stella Duffy, activist Jack Monroe and US rock musician Thurston Moore are supporting the London march, while in the US organisers claim that many of the musicians who have refused to play at Trump’s inauguration will join them. “I’m supporting this march because I don’t want to be a bystander to the politics of fear, division and aggression that defined crucial votes in the UK and the US in 2016,” said Geldof. She added: “I believe that kindness, love and unity are stronger than hate. I believe that we are stronger together. Together we can show that no matter who you are, you have a voice, and it’s a voice worth being heard.”', 'Technology? Bah humbug: “I think we ought to get on with our lives,” said Donald Trump on Wednesday, summing up his take on the complex problem of apparently Russian phishing attacks on multiple Democratic party groups during the 2016 election. As the White House’s current resident prepared to impose sanctions on Russia for hacking, Trump said: “I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what’s going on.” It’s not the first time the president-elect has been stumped by the digital world, like a technophobe who unwrapped a computer-operated nuclear arsenal on Christmas morning. And the trouble isn’t that nobody knows exactly what’s going on in the “age of computer” – it’s that technology poses some of the most complex problems in human history to the incoming administration. And its leader is a man who refers to “the cyber” and seems more concerned about the weight of the hacker, or possibly the bed – his syntax is mysterious – than about who broke into the Democratic National Committee.\\nUS authorities spent 2016 attempting to chart new territory even beyond the DNC, DCCC and Clinton campaign hacks: how can Americans protect their infrastructure from attacks on the foundations of the internet, such as the Mirai botnet siege in October that took down some of the biggest, and most sophisticated, tech companies in the world? How can the nation’s patchwork of electoral authorities repair voting systems prone to massive, potentially catastrophic error? How should the government treat open-source encryption? Trump remains silent on the details of digital policy as the leader-to-be of a government in desperate need of consistent guiding principles. Instead, Trump appears to regard technology as a contact point for the same obsessions that drove his campaign. He is blase about warrantless surveillance – he has said it “would be fine” to restore the NSA’s bulk data collection programs, a position his pick for CIA director, Mike Pompeo, also endorses, as does Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions. He is far more actively concerned about appearing stronger than his predecessor, Barack Obama, and as always about Chinese activity in cyberspace:\\nEspecially when they start “cyber hacking us”:\\nHe also occasionally made time during the campaign to mock opponent Hillary Clinton for getting sick and getting hacked:\\nTrump has been general, albeit chilling, on the topic of what exactly his administration will do: as an extension of Trump’s ideology, information gathering will serve to do the unthinkable – his own word. “We’re going to have to do things that we never did before,” he told Yahoo News. “And some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule. And certain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy. And so we’re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.”\\nThe apparent lack of interest in the minutiae of his own positions has left his administration’s tech strategy in the hands of Peter Thiel, the thin-skinned billionaire founder of PayPal who quietly bankrolled former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan’s annihilating lawsuit against news outlet Gawker, apparently in retaliation for an article about Thiel’s sexual orientation. Earlier this month, Thiel indulged Trump’s own grudge against Twitter during the president-elect’s “tech summit” at Trump Tower, shutting out the organization that provides Trump with his loudest megaphone reportedly because Twitter refused to add an emoji to the Trump campaign’s #CrookedHillary sponsored hashtag during the election. Another of Thiel’s companies, data-mining firm Palantir, already plays a powerful role: the company’s services are likely to be used in any effort to deport undocumented immigrants, according to multiple reports. But for the president-elect himself, technology appears to be yet another venue for increasingly dangerous hobbies including threats to cut programs that benefit US allies, brinksmanship with China and unraveling Obamacare.\\nTrump calls net neutrality “a top-down power grab” that “will target conservative media”; he has often repeated his support for a registry of American Muslims, and generally demonstrates not merely a lack of proficiency in technology but a contempt for expertise. But like every rich guy who wants to stay that way, he keeps a couple of eggheads around, and between him and them, when it comes to tech policy they will make America … something. Possibly not great.', 'Donald Trump’s election shook the world as no other event of 2016. His presidency is still four weeks away, so it would be wrong to pass a verdict on it before there is any evidence. Yet the world can be justifiably fearful. Mr\\xa0Trump’s cabinet picks, an overwhelmingly white male cohort of low tax and small government obsessives, climate change denying oilmen, and career soldiers, add to the dismay. But it is Mr Trump who matters. This week, the president-elect has revived the idea of a ban on Muslims entering the US and has given the green light to a new nuclear arms race. For Americans to choose someone with Mr Trump’s prejudices and instincts remains as outrageous now as it did on 8\\xa0November. It\\xa0will not be hard to stay shocked. Never before has a candidate tried so hard to make America hate again. That’s why the Trump election was bigger than Brexit, both in itself and because of its global impact. Never before has someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan prepared to enter the White House. Never before, if you believe the CIA, has a foreign power intervened so audaciously in a US election. The impact on America itself is already enormous. No elected president has been greeted with more overt hostility, more protests and, perhaps most important of all, more soul searching. The biggest question for 2017 and beyond is how Mr Trump’s personality, judgment and behaviour will impact and shape America and the way it is governed. Election has not obviously changed him. He remains by turns shameless, impulsive, vain, threatening, slapdash, abusive – and much else. The personality matters; it shapes his judgment. It also matters because he appears to recognise so few boundaries between his private interests and his public responsibilities. This is one of those moments when those who report politics and analyse policy need to summon fresh rigour to their tasks. Mr\\xa0Trump’s election will not mean politics as usual. His victory, the election of an authoritarian and demagogue in the world’s most important democracy, has raised fundamental questions of whether America is in some sense falling apart, its historic norms now unsustainable, perhaps to the extent that it is a failed state. Serious people are even asking how far and in what ways it is appropriate to consider Mr Trump a fascist or whether the republic itself can endure.\\nTo ask such questions is not to presuppose that the answer is yes. America is not a failed state. Mr Trump is not a fascist (though it is unnerving even to discuss whether he is a little bit fascist). The US remains one of the most prosperous and innovative places in the world. It is still governed according to the rule of law. It has both a well-educated and a large ageing population – each of which is a seedbed for stability, not revolution. And America is a more serious place, in the best sense, than it can seem from outside. As David Runciman has written, “its frustrations are those of a country where all this is true and yet still things are going wrong”. But the echoes of the 1930s should be taken seriously. Mr Trump says his nation is broken, corrupt and violent and he is the answer to all three problems. Race remains an often virulent obsession among his supporters. He charged during the campaign that Hillary Clinton “meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors,” language drenched in classic antisemitism – as he must surely know. This triggers the question of whether those who voted for him really believed him. What they believed, perhaps, was that he would shake things up in ways that might be good for them and that no other candidate would do. To reach a verdict on Mr Trump means keeping several once unthinkable questions in mind. One of these is whether Americans truly believe that the US is a place whose institutions no longer provide stable government. Another is whether these institutions have forfeited consent so badly that the people want them overthrown and replaced. A third is whether they genuinely expect Mr Trump is going to do that. Another America America is certainly not working. Its failings have generated destabilising fears (see graph above). These have in turn produced Mr Trump. He was not a normal candidate. The election was not a normal election. Mr Trump will not be a normal president. It remains to be seen what he does in office. But it is neither honest nor true to pretend that this is the same America as in earlier eras. This is another America, and it has to be judged as such. Yet rigour also means acknowledging things that point in a different direction. The US stock market is currently surging in the expectation of a big fiscal stimulus in the spring. Though the president-elect’s favourability ratings remain negative – and are far inferior to Barack Obama’s increasingly positive figures – they are clearly narrowing. And a Pew poll this week showed that fewer Democrats now feel angry about the result of the election than expected to, just before it happened. None of this may last. All\\xa0of it may be transient. But it can’t just be ignored. Two days before the election, Mr Trump went to an old steel-making community near Pittsburgh. There he told a cheering crowd: “We are going to win the great state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win back the White House … When we win, we are bringing steel back, we are going to bring steel back to Pennsylvania, like it used to be. We are putting our steel workers and our miners back to work. We are.” Parallels with Brexit Some bits of that have come true. Mr Trump won Pennsylvania – by 44,000 votes. He won back the White House – though more than 2.8\\xa0million more people voted for Mrs Clinton. Other parts, however, were and are lies. It is not true that Mr Trump will be bringing steel back to Pennsylvania like it used to be. He can’t. It is not true that he will be putting steel workers and miners back to work. He won’t. Most Trump voters were relatively well off, not poor; most of the poorest Americans voted for Mrs Clinton. But blue-collar white workers in swing states like Pennsylvania tipped the election to Mr Trump. Just 80,000 of them in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania made the difference. These voters were fired up that here, at last, was a candidate who took, or said he took, their lives seriously – and who might win. But that does not mean they believed his promises. The elusive truth about the Trump presidency may be that it rests on a tacit understanding on both sides: that he was telling lies, that his voters knew it; that they were going to vote for him anyway because he would rattle the system; but that they could simultaneously rely on the system to shield them from the worst effects of their reckless choice. In that respect, there may be a parallel with the UK’s Brexit vote. Two things can nevertheless be said with some confidence. The first is that, even if they do not believe him, Americans have elected their most unpredictable and dangerous president of all time. The second\\xa0is\\xa0that Mr Trump will fail in the end, in spite of the damage he does on the way, because he will not be able to satisfy those who swung the vote his way in November. However you look at the possibilities, the Trump presidency makes 2017 a fearful prospect for America and the world.', 'Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will shut down his charitable foundation, a response to mounting complaints over conflicts related to the president-elect’s charitable and business interests. In a statement released by his campaign, Trump said the Donald J Trump Foundation would be “dissolved” to avoid “even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President”. Trump said he would continue to pursue his “strong interest in philanthropy” in other ways.\\nThe closure of the Trump Foundation, which was first reported by the New York Times, requires the approval of the New York attorney general’s office, which is currently investigating the nonprofit and issued a cease and desist order to it in October. The Donald J Trump Foundation was repeatedly the subject of controversy throughout the presidential campaign after a series of investigations by the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold. Trump reportedly used $258,000 of the foundation’s money to pay for personal legal settlements. He also spent charitable funds on multiple portraits of himself and on a football helmet autographed by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. The foundation also made a donation to a political group supporting Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump backer in violation of tax law. The president-elect has since paid $2,500 to the Internal Revenue Service over the donation. Trump had not donated to his own foundation since 2008; the nonprofit relied on donations from other Trump associates, including professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5m to the Trump Foundation. Linda McMahon has since been announced as Trump’s nominee to lead the Small Business Administration. The decision also comes as Trump’s children have been under scrutiny for charitable efforts that raised questions over whether people were paying for access to the incoming president and his family. A celebrity auction for a coffee date with Ivanka Trump, sponsored by Eric Trump’s charity, was called off earlier in December because donors were apparently given an attempt to curry favor with the incoming president and buy access to one of his closest advisers. Both Eric and his brother, Don Jr, were also scheduled to appear at a reception on behalf of conservation charities over the weekend of the inauguration. The reception, which has since been canceled, reportedly promised the opportunity to meet the president-elect in exchange for $1m in donations.\\nThese issues have come as Trump’s entire real estate business has come under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest. In particular, Trump’s international properties have the potential to violate the emoluments clause of the constitution, which prohibits anyone holding “an office of profit or trust” from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state”. But these conflicts also apply domestically, as the Kuwaiti government has already announced that it is shifting its annual party in February to Trump’s new hotel in Washington. The issues are further amplified because the Trump Organization is a privately held corporation and the president-elect has flouted longstanding tradition in not releasing his tax returns. The result is that there is no clear way to know what assets and liabilities Trump has. It is known, though, that Trump owes $364m to Deutsche Bank. A news conference that the president-elect promised to hold on the topic on 15 December has since been postponed until sometime in January 2017.', 'Donald Trump harangued the former first minister of Scotland as “Mad Alex” and accused him of being on a “march to oblivion” in a series of increasingly angry and eccentric letters about windfarms he claimed were blighting his Scottish golf courses. The correspondence with Alex Salmond, revealed by the Huffington Post after a freedom of information request, demonstrated that Trump’s tone swung wildly between coaxing and threatening as he grew increasingly frustrated with his former ally’s refusal to change his policy on renewable energy. Trump warned Salmond that his dream of Scottish independence would be “gone with the wind” if he continued to support windfarm developments, accusing the then leader of the Scottish National party of being “hellbent” on damaging Scotland’s coastline. In 16 published letters, only one of which Salmond replied to, Trump went on to insist that his own motives were to “save Scotland” and “honour my mother”, who was born on the Isle of Lewis before emigrating to the US in her early 20s. Referring to windfarms as “monsters”, the series of letters suggests Salmond “let them ruin the coastline of Sweden first”, declaring that “wind power doesn’t work” and warning him that “your economy will become a third world wasteland that investors will avoid”.\\nTrump has been involved in a long-running conflict with the Scottish government over the impact of windfarms on his Scottish golf courses. Salmond supported Trump’s £750m development of the Menie golf resort in Aberdeenshire after planning permission was refused by Aberdeenshire council because of the potential impact on a legally protected coastal nature reserve. But the pair fell out after Trump lodged repeated legal challenges to an offshore windfarm being built in the North Sea, several miles off the Aberdeenshire links course and backed by Salmond. Last December, Trump lost his appeal against the turbines at the supreme court. It prompted an extraordinary war of words between the billionaire and Salmond, who said Trump was “three times a loser”, while the Trump Organisation hit back at the former SNP leader as a “has-been”. A spokesperson for Salmond confirmed on Wednesday that the communications were genuine, adding: “They show a Scottish first minister steadfastly refusing to bow to extreme pressure from Mr Trump in opposition to wind energy. “We can only hope that the responsibilities of office change a man and that the president-elect comes to see the benefits of renewable energy, not only to the environment but to local businesses and communities.” The letters, dated from September 2011 to June 2013, show the billionaire fulminating at the consequences of windfarm development, as well as displaying a rather partial grasp of Scottish history: “The people of Scotland will forever suffer! With the reckless installation of these monsters, you will single-handedly have done more damage to Scotland than virtually any event in Scottish history!”\\n“You seem hellbent on destroying Scotland’s coastline and therefore Scotland itself,” he wrote on 9 February 2012. “But I will never be ‘on board’, as you have stated I would be, with this insanity. As a matter of fact, I have just authorised my staff to allocate a substantial amount of money to launch an international campaign to fight your plan to surround Scotland’s coast with many thousands of wind turbines – it will be like looking through the bars of a prison and the Scottish citizens will be the prisoners!” In another epistle, this time addressed to Philip Hammond, Trump thanked the then defence secretary for “your ongoing objection to these horrendous machines that will ruin Scotland and compromise the United Kingdom’s air defence program”. He concluded: “The defence of the UK is far too important to tinker with just to satisfy Alex Salmond’s bloated ego.”\\nEarlier this year, Salmond urged Americans not to vote for Trump, claiming he had a “bullying” nature that made him unfit to be US president, and revealing for the first time what he described as “green ink” letters that were sent by courier across the Atlantic. Trump’s business interests span the globe and entangle him with numerous foreign governments but he has refused to release his tax returns to give a clearer picture. Last month, he used a meeting with the former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, and other Brexit supporters to encourage them to oppose windfarms that he argued would spoil the view from one of his golf courses in Scotland. At another meeting with Silicon Valley tech leaders at Trump Tower, three of his children, who will manage his companies during his time in office, were present, while Trump-branded water was served. Trump also met his Indian business partners and posed for pictures with them while the Philippines government announced it was appointing his business partner in Manila as its next ambassador to Washington. A day after he spoke to Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, Trump’s Argentinian associate confidently predicted that construction would start next year on the planned Trump Tower Buenos Aires, despite zoning restrictions that have held it back.', '“Surreal” has been named word of the year by Merriam-Webster. The word was apparently the most searched for on the dictionary publisher’s website, in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential election victory in November.\\nIt makes sense, given that Trump spent the election and its aftermath doing, saying and more often than not tweeting things that were untrue, offensive or bizarre. And still won. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump combined two of those three qualities when he accused China of “stealing” a US navy drone – “ripping” it out of the water, no less – in what he said was an “unpresidented” act. The president-elect corrected himself and deleted the offending tweet, confirming that he had meant to type “unprecedented” and leaving at least one key national security adviser professedly baffled by the whole thing. The original term seems so appropriately descriptive of Trump’s behaviour, however, that it seems a shame to let it go to waste. The Guardian is therefore nominating “unpresidented” as its own word of the year. Here are some definitions. unpresidented An instance of someone being “prepared to say what most of us are thinking”, but actually saying things most of us are not thinking When making remarks on Mexico (sending rapists to the US); on the Gold Star mother Ghazala Khan (maybe she wasn’t allowed to speak); and on women in general, Trump probably believed he was performing that cliched act of “saying things that most of us are thinking”. Except, most of us are not thinking the things Trump is thinking. And if we are, it is only in the sense of: “Who in their right mind would think that?” Usage: “Did you hear Donald Trump say China was raping our country? That was so unpresidented.” unpresidented An irrecoverable act of folly committed by a president During his campaign, Trump said Russia was “not going into Ukraine”. Vladimir Putin had actually annexed Crimea. Trump also used a televised debate to defend the size of his penis. It seems very likely there will be more moments like these when Trump is actually commander-in-chief. Usage: “One of Barack Obama’s most unpresidented moments was when he wore those mom jeans. One of Donald Trump’s most unpresidented moments was when he started that full-scale nuclear war.”\\nunpresidented Feeling of loss when a president who has neither the temperament nor the knowledge to actually be president is elected president, causing one to wonder who will actually be running the country and triggering feelings of malaise and dread See above for examples of Trump lacking both the temperament and knowledge to be president. See the recent Saturday Night Live sketch about who will be running the country. Look inside yourself for the feelings of malaise and dread. Usage: The current situation. unpresidented The state of an impeached president.', 'The denouement of the 2016 election came on Monday, as electors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia formally elected Donald Trump as president of the United States.\\nAn effort by anti-Trump activists, who had urged electors to back efforts led by celebrities and academics to cast their ballots at variance with election results to keep Trump from reaching the necessary 270 electoral votes, came to practically nothing. With counts still ongoing in California and Texas, the number of electoral college members who attempted to cast a protest vote was likely to reach at least nine. In some state capitals, proceedings were met with protests. More than 200 demonstrators were on the steps of Pennsylvania’s capitol in Harrisburg on Monday morning, waving signs and chanting in chilly, 25F(-4C) weather. They chanted “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!” and “No treason, no Trump!” Several dozen protesters gathered outside South Carolina’s statehouse in Columbia, waving signs with messages imploring electors not to back the president-elect. Vermont was the first state to report the results of its vote. As expected, all three electors voted for Clinton. Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, West Virginia and South Carolina followed for Trump, and Delaware for Clinton as the totals started to mount. After a Hawaiian elector cast a vote for Bernie Sanders, the total was Trump with 304 votes and Clinton with 227. It takes 270 electoral college votes to win the presidency. Texas put Trump over the top, despite two Republican electors casting protest votes.\\nRepublican electors said they had been deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support Trump. Many emails were part of coordinated campaigns. “The letters are actually quite sad,” Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina, told the Associated Press. “They are generally freaked out. They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.” The Guardian spoke to six so-called “faithless electors” who intended to change their vote, all but one of them Democrats. The sole Republican, Christopher Suprun of Texas, said: “Since I announced my intention to vote according to my conscience, I have received about half a dozen death threats against me and my family. “More happily, a person I’ve known for years who traces his ancestry back to the American revolution told me he thinks his forebears would have been proud of what I’m doing, which made me feel pretty good.” Wirt A Yerger Jr, a Republican elector in Mississippi, said: “I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.”\\nA joint session of Congress is scheduled for 6 January to certify the results of the electoral college vote, with Vice-President Joe Biden presiding as president of the Senate. Once the result is certified, the winner will be sworn in on 20 January.\\n“When the founders of our country created [the electoral college] 200-plus years ago, they didn’t have confidence in the average white man who had property, because that’s who got to vote,” Shawn Terris, a Democratic elector from Ventura, California, told the AP. “It just seems so undemocratic to me that people other than the voters get to choose who leads the country.” In Minnesota, won by Clinton, a Democrat who did not intend to vote for Clinton was replaced. The elector in question was a delegate for Sanders at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia in July. David Bright, a Democratic elector from Maine, said on his Facebook page he had voted for Sanders, because his vote would not have helped Clinton win the presidency. “I cast my electoral college vote for Bernie Sanders today to let those new voters who were inspired by him know that some of us did hear them, did listen to them, do respect them and understand their disappointment,” he wrote. His vote was however ruled improper, and switched to Clinton. The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Earlier this month, Donald Trump used a “thank-you” rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to give his supporters further insight into the “deal-making” team he intends to build in Washington. As president-elect, Trump has so far nominated a number of billionaires, three Goldman Sachs bankers and the chief executive of the world’s largest oil firm to senior positions. Responding to liberal consternation at the sheer wealth of the prospective appointees, Trump told his audience: “A newspaper [the New York Times] criticised me and said: ‘Why can’t they have people of modest means?’ Because I want people that made a fortune. Because now they are negotiating for you, OK? It’s no different than a great baseball player or a great golfer.” Trump’s cabinet, which is not yet fully filled, is already said to be worth a combined $14bn – the richest White House top table ever assembled. His team – if all are confirmed by the Senate – will be worth 50 times the $250m combined wealth of George W Bush’s first cabinet, which the media at the time dubbed the “team of millionaires”. For Trump, those figures are simply a confirmation of competence: in Trumpian politics, the richer you are, the better you must be at cutting a deal. And “deal-making” is what the next White House will be all about. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly returned to the theme of the “terrible deals” cut by previous administrations, from the North American Free Trade Agreement to the nuclear deal with Iran. He described Nafta, an agreement with Canada and Mexico, as “the worst trade deal maybe ever”; the Iran nuclear pact was a “disaster” and “the worst deal ever negotiated” and would be “ripped up”. China was called a “big abuser” for artificially depressing its currency to give its exports a boost at the expense of US jobs. The implication was that, under the leadership of Trump, America Inc would finally begin to punch its weight in the market of global diplomacy. According to Peter Henning, a constitutional law professor at Wayne State University, appointing business leaders to top political positions has become the norm in American politics, but Trump’s nominations were “unique in the volume of people with minimal, if any, government experience”. “I am always wary of people who say ‘we have to run the country like a business’ – businesses aren’t responsible for defence or caring for the elderly,” he said. “Businesses are driven with one guiding principle – to make the most money – and that should not be the role of the government.”\\nThe backlash has begun in earnest. The criticism Trump objected to in Des Moines came from a New York Times editorial questioning the Trump administration’s seeming lack of interest in vetting nominees for potential conflicts of interest. Top Democrats and leading ethics and constitutional law experts have also raised concerns about Trump’s selection process.\\nBernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who campaigned for the Democratic nomination and promised that, if elected, he would redistribute the vast wealth of the 1% to poorer families, has dubbed Trump’s top team the “cabinet of billionaires”. “I guess they have a few poor millionaires on it but, mostly, it is billionaires,” Sanders said. He accused Trump of going back on his pledge to lead an anti-establishment revolution and “drain the swamp”. “If the cabinet he appointed of billionaires and millionaires is anti-establishment, boy, I would hate to see what the ‘establishment’ looks like,” Sanders said on NBC’s Late Night with Seth Meyers. “Maybe I am not seeing something here, but you don’t appoint the head of ExxonMobil to be secretary of state. That is not quite taking on the establishment.” It is the selection of Exxon’s chief executive, Rex Tillerson, whom Trump described as “one of the truly great business leaders of the world” in an early morning tweet announcing his appointment as secretary of state, that has caused the most upset on both sides of the aisle.\\nAs well as a phalanx of Democrats, the leading Republican senators Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, have raised concerns about Tillerson’s close relationship with Vladimir Putin and conflicts of interest arising from Exxon’s interests in Russia. Tillerson, 64, who has spent his whole career at the oil giant, was awarded Russia’s Order of Friendship in 2013 after he agreed a deal with the state-owned oil company Rosneft, run by the Putin lieutenant Igor Sechin. The partnership to drill for oil in the Arctic and explore in Siberia and the Black Sea was iced following the imposition of sanctions on Russia when it annexed Crimea. It means that Exxon has tens of billions of potential Russian assets lying idle. Tillerson has $245m of Exxon stock. As secretary of state, Tillerson will be leading discussions on whether the US should maintain sanctions against Russia. He will also be forming America’s policy on the Syria crisis, the Iran nuclear deal (which Trump has described as “terrible”), and relations with North Korea. “When he gets the friendship award from a butcher, frankly, it’s an issue that I think needs to be examined,” McCain told Fox News. Rubio, who serves on the foreign relations committee that will vet Tillerson’s nomination before a full Senate vote, has said he has “serious concerns” about the appointment. “The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America’s interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America’s foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage,” he said. In its most recent session, the foreign relations committee was composed of 10 Republicans and nine Democrats, meaning that if Trump lost one Republican, Tillerson’s appointment could be at least stalled. Other controversial big business appointments include Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer, named as director of the National Economic Council – or, as Trump put it, his “top economic adviser”. Trump said Cohn, who has worked at Goldman for 26 years and amassed some $200m of the bank’s stock, would “put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people”. “He will help craft economic policies that will grow wages for our workers, stop the exodus of jobs overseas and create many great new opportunities for Americans who have been struggling.”\\nCohn’s appointment does not require Senate approval, and could serve as a stepping stone to other government positions at the US treasury or the Federal Reserve, a route that has been well trodden in the past. Trump’s pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is also a multimillionaire former Goldman banker who went on to be dubbed a “foreclosure king” for buying up distressed mortgages and evicting thousands of homeowners during the financial crisis.\\nElizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democratic senator, called Mnuchin “the Forrest Gump of the financial crisis” because he “managed to participate in all the worst practices on Wall Street” during his lengthy career. “His selection as treasury secretary should send shivers down the spine of every American who got hit hard by the financial crisis, and is the latest sign that Donald Trump has no intention of draining the swamp and every intention of running Washington to benefit himself and his rich buddies,” she said. The selection of three Goldman bankers could open Trump up to criticism as, during the campaign, the president-elect repeatedly highlighted the bank as emblematic of the corrupt global elite that had stolen the futures of hard-working Americans. Days before the election, Trump launched a TV advert that portrayed the Goldman chairman and chief executive Lloyd Blankfein as the personification of the global elite, which he said had “robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities”. Trump’s ire against Goldman persisted throughout the campaign: he attacked Hillary Clinton for giving paid speeches to the bank and accused his Republican nomination rival Ted Cruz of being “owned” by Goldman because his wife worked at the bank. “He will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!” Trump said in a January tweet. But beyond the accusations of brazen hypocrisy, it is the enmeshing of business interests with affairs of state which is causing the deepest concern. Jordan Libowitz, of the DC watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Trump’s cabinet had might have the most conflicts of interest in history. “There have been business leaders, and very rich ones, in the cabinet in the past but never of this depth and scale. The question is not whether he is seeking to run the White House like a business, but more whether he will be running it as his business. People will question whether the provocative actions he has taken so far are in the interests of the country or in the interests of his businesses.” Libowitz said it could be argued that “Trump is seeking to use the White House as an extension of Trump Tower. That’s why we think that the only way to remove conflict of interest is for the Trump organisations to be sold outside of the family and the proceeds moved into a blind trust.”\\nTrump has given no indication that he will relinquish ownership of his global real estate and licensing empire. He has only pledged to make “no new deals” and hand over management to his sons, Donald Jr and Eric, who also have official roles on the transition team. Meanwhile, the billionaires continue to pack their bags for DC. The private equity billionaire Wilbur Ross has been nominated as commerce secretary with a mission “to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic commerce”. Ross, 79, who was called a “vulture investor” for buying up failing companies, cutting jobs and flipping them for often huge profits, has amassed a $2.9bn fortune via his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co. Ross last week agreed to buy a $12m seven-bedroom house on DC’s leafy Woodland Drive, known as “billionaire’s row”. The 10,000-sq ft gatehouse has a 12-seat cinema and staff quarters, and sits opposite the home of the current commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker. Working with Ross as deputy commerce secretary will be Todd Ricketts, another billionaire and co-owner of the Chicago Cubs. He inherited his wealth from his billionaire father, Joe Ricketts, founder of the brokerage TD Ameritrade. The Ricketts family donated $1m to Trump’s campaign. Another beneficiary of dynastic wealth nominated to serve under Trump is Betsy DeVos, the daughter-in-law of the Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $5bn. “I’m not shocked by this,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. “It’s a billionaire president being surrounded by a billionaire and millionaire cabinet, with a billionaire agenda … to hurt the middle class. The appointments suggest that he’s going to break his campaign promises.” Trump may feel secure in his picks, given Republican control of Congress, but there is no guarantee they will all make it into office. While Trump himself hasn’t published his tax returns (despite a four-decade tradition of doing so) or sold any businesses that could represent a conflict of interest, his nominees’ finances will undergo intense scrutiny. Senator Orrin Hatch, the finance committee chairman, said nominees “will undergo the same bipartisan vetting process as the nominees from previous administrations” and will not progress to a public hearing until the committee has reviewed the past three years of a nominee’s tax returns. The multi-page questionnaire asks nominees to list all jobs held since college, all business relationships, political activities and contributions, any legal or ethical conflicts and a calculation of the nominee and their family’s net worth. They will also be under oath to declare if they have paid taxes, including those for household staff. The law requires that executive branch employees have no role in government matters that could benefit their financial interests or those of their families. It means they must give up any paid or unpaid jobs, including board positions, and sell stock. Meanwhile, as Trump is exempt from many of the laws that apply to his appointments, he is taking full advantage. He isn’t even giving up the limelight of The New Celebrity Apprentice, where he will remain an executive producer while in office. “Presidents have a right to do things in their spare time,” his adviser Kellyanne Conway said. Another successful deal for the president-elect. DEAL OR NO DEAL? China\\nWhat’s the current “deal”? China is the US’s second-largest trading partner, after Canada. US exports are vital to China’s economy and the US is similarly reliant on its cheap imports. However, the US has been alarmed by China’s attitude to intellectual property and US competition. What new deal does Trump want? Trump wants a new trade deal with China. He has said the US was being “hurt very badly by China with devaluation”, though, in fact, China has been inflating its currency recently. Trump angered Beijing when he took a call from Taiwan’s president; China regards the island as sovereign territory and US presidents have not spoken to its leaders in 40 years. How likely is he to get his way? Trump’s Taiwan call seemed like a blunder but has been spun as a signal that US recognition of Taiwan could be a bargaining chip in a “better” trade deal. But Taiwan is non-negotiable for China and any such move is likely to meet with retaliation that will hurt the US economy and potentially lead to a global trade war – or worse. Iran\\nWhat’s the current deal? America’s historically tense relationship with Iran was somewhat eased last year when the US joined six other countries in signing a landmark nuclear deal. This exchanges a lifting of nuclear-related sanctions on Iran, which were crippling its economy, for a dismantling of its nuclear facilities. What does Trump want? Trump has heavily criticised the Iran deal and, at times, threatened to dismantle it; however, his aides said he would only seek to refine it or negotiate it. This would be extremely difficult and the president-elect has not been clear on what he would replace it with. How likely is he to get his way? The likelihood of tearing up the Iran deal is slim, as many of the deal’s original critics oppose completely dismantling it, including Trump’s nominee for secretary of defence, James Mattis. Iran has mostly been in compliance with the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which also makes renegotiation difficult. Defence\\nWhat’s the deal? The US defence contractor Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet programme, which comes with an estimated $400bn price tag, has been described as “the most expensive weapon system in history”. What new deal does Trump want? A cheaper one. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control,” Trump said on Twitter, a pronouncement that knocked Lockheed’s share price – and those of other defence contractors involved in the project, including Britain’s BAE. Trump went on to pledge: “Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.” How likely is he to get his way? Quite. While a president cannot cancel a programme after funds have been allocated, Trump has room for manoeuvre. Many in the US agree the programme is out of control. Even the US Senate armed services committee chairman, John McCain, who has voiced support for the fighter jet in the past, has suggested the president could buy fewer of the jets in the future. Russia\\nWhat’s the current deal? Relations have been poor over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, while US sanctions have pushed Russia into recession. The CIA claims Russia hacked into Democratic National Committee emails to influence the election in Trump’s favour. What new deal does Trump want? Trump has said he wants better relations with Russia and has complimented Vladimir Putin, including about his “leadership” after the Russian president was accused of killing journalists. He nominated Tillerson, who has with close ties to Russia, as secretary of state, and has rejected the CIA’s election claims. How likely is he to get his way? Putin is open to a rapprochement with a Trump-led US. In an address earlier this month, he said he was “ready for cooperation with the new American administration”. What this means for conflicts in Syria and Ukraine remains to be seen. Politically, this may help Trump in some regions (and hurt in others); economically, it means little. US goods and services trade with Russia is worth about $38bn; with China it tops $659bn.', 'Donald Trump’s public disparagement of US intelligence agencies would have a discouraging effort on the country’s spies and undermine the moral authority of their leaders to send them “into harm’s way”, a former CIA director said on Wednesday Michael Hayden, who served as director of the NSA and then the CIA during the George W Bush administration, entered the growing controversy over the president-elect’s attitude towards the US intelligence community. Trump has questioned its conclusion that Russia had hacked the Democratic National Committee and the CIA’s reported finding that Moscow had meddled in the presidential election in Trump’s favour. It also emerged that Trump had only met intelligence officials to receive what is normally a daily briefing, four times since the election. “I get it when I need it,” he said. An aide said on Wednesday that he would from now on receive a presidential daily brief three times a week instead of just once.\\nHayden said that missing the daily briefing would be discouraging “but may not be catastrophic” if he was well briefed by top aides. However the public denigration of the work of the intelligence agencies would be more damaging, Hayden said. “That would be very discouraging, if the information is rejected, if the information is never used,” Hayden told the Guardian in an interview. “That information is sometimes bought at great price. A director of the CIA sends people into harm’s way to get information otherwise unavailable. If it’s not used, if it’s rejected or it’s contradicted, under what moral authority then would I as a director send these men and women out to do it?” Hayden, who served as NSA director from 1999 to 2005 and CIA director from 2006 to 2009, said: “I have been fairly concerned about what the president-elect has said. It’s not just the question of Russian hacking and his reluctance to accept what appears to be good evidence that the Russians did this. “There is the broader question I’m concerned about,” he added. “Will the president accept the intelligence guys to come in and give him points of view that are different from his a priori assumptions or beliefs? That’s really important, so I’m looking for clues about that.” He noted that Jimmy Carter had preferred to be briefed by his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and suggested that once in office, Trump might prefer to get his briefings from his vice president, Mike Pence. Asked about the potential role of the man Trump has picked to be his national security adviser, retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn, Hayden expressed reservations.\\n“Mike is going to have to act a bit differently from how he has during the campaign. Mike is tactically brilliant. He has been a very successful general officer at the tactical level. This is a strategic job, so it’s going to extend him,” Hayden said. “And especially for this president who has said some intemperate things on the campaign, I would like the national security adviser to be a calming influence and Mike in the campaign was at least as intemperate as the president.” The former CIA and NSA director was speaking after giving an address at a conference on terrorism organised by the Jamestown Foundation thinktank, at which he was also critical Trump’s proposed counter-terrorist strategy, in particular the suggestion that the US might find common cause with Russia in Syria to fight the Islamic State. “Im personally very sceptical of any convergence between Russian and US interests in this part of the world,” he said, pointing to Russian support for the Assad regime, which he argued was generating terrorism by its repression. “[Trump] literally said: if you fight Isis you’re our friend,” he said. “Well, the world is a complicated place. There are other issues out there.”', '‘Trump is our wakeup call’ Raul Rodriguez, 74, Apple Valley, California I always carry a bullhorn with me to rallies and campaign events. Into it I shout: “America, wake up!” Americans have been asleep for way too long. We need to realise that the future of our country is at stake. If we don’t elect Donald Trump, we’ll get another four years of Barack Obama and frankly, I don’t know what would happen to this wonderful country of ours. Obama has already done so much to destroy our way of life and Hillary Clinton is promising to carry on where he left off. Like Obama, she wants to change our fundamental values – the ones people like my father fought to defend. My father was born in Durango, Mexico. When he came to the US he joined the military and served as a medic during the second world war. He was a very proud American – he truly loved this country. I think I got my sense of patriotism from him. Obama and Hillary Clinton want to have open borders. They let illegal immigrants cross our borders and now they want to accept thousands of Syrians. We don’t know who these people are. If they want to come to this country, they have to do it the right way, like my father did it. I’m tired of politicians telling voters what they want to hear and then returning to Washington and doing whatever their party tells them to do. Politicians are supposed to represent the people – not their parties or their donors. Part of the reason I like Donald Trump is because he isn’t an established politician. Sometimes that hurts him and people get offended. But the truth hurts. Even if he doesn’t say it well, he’s not wrong. Trump is our wakeup call. ‘Democrats treat Latinos as if we’re all one big group’ Ximena Barreto, 31, San Diego, California\\nI was in primary school in my native Colombia when my father was murdered. I was six – just one year older than my daughter is now. My father was an officer in the Colombian army at a time when wearing a uniform made you a target for narcoterrorists, Farc fighters and guerrilla groups. What I remember clearly from those early years is the bombing and the terror. I was so afraid, especially after my dad died. At night, I would curl up in my mother’s bed while she held me close. She could not promise me that everything was going to be all right, because it wasn’t true. I don’t want my daughter to grow up like that. But when I turn on my TV, I see terrorist attacks in San Bernardino and in Orlando. There are dangerous people coming across our borders. Trump was right. Some are rapists and criminals, but some are good people, too. But how do we know who is who, when you come here illegally? I moved to the US in 2006 on a work permit. It took nearly five years and thousands of dollars to become a US citizen. I know the process is not perfect, but it’s the law. Why would I want illegals coming in when I had to go through this? It’s not fair that they’re allowed to jump the line and take advantage of so many benefits, ones that I pay for with my tax dollars. People assume that because I’m a woman, I should vote for the woman; or that because I’m Latina, I should vote for the Democrat. The Democrats have been pandering to minorities and women for the last 50 years. They treat Latinos as if we’re all one big group. I’m Colombian – I don’t like Mariachi music. Donald Trump is not just saying what he thinks people want to hear, he’s saying what they’re afraid to say. I believe that he’s the only candidate who can make America strong and safe again. ‘Trump beat the system: what’s more American than that?’ Bertran Usher, 20, Inglewood, California\\nDonald Trump is the candidate America deserves. For decades, Americans have bemoaned politicians and Washington insiders. We despise political speak and crave fresh, new ideas. When you ask for someone with no experience, this is what you get. It’s like saying you don’t want a doctor to operate on you. But Trump is a big FU to America. He beat the system and proved everyone wrong. What’s more American than that? As a political science student who one day hopes to go into politics, I am studying this election closely. Both candidates are deeply unpopular and people of my generation are not happy with their choices. I believe we can learn what not to do from this election. I see how divided the country is, and it’s the clearest sign that politicians will have to learn to work together to make a difference. It’s not always easy, but I’ve seen this work. I was raised in a multicultural household. My mother, a Democrat, is Latino and African American, raised in the inner city of Los Angeles. My father, a Republican, is an immigrant from Belize. My parents and I don’t always see eye to eye on everything, but our spirited debates have helped add nuance to my politics. I’m in favour of small government, but I support gay rights. I believe welfare is an important service for Americans who need it, but I think our current programme needs to be scaled back. I think we need to have stricter enforcement of people who come to the country illegally, but I don’t think we should deport the DREAMers [children of immigrants who were brought to the country illegally, named after the 2001 Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act]. Trump can be a nut, but I think he’s the best candidate in this election. Though there are issues of his I disagree with, at least he says what’s on his mind, as opposed to Hillary Clinton, who hides what she’s thinking behind her smile. It’s up to my generation to fix the political mess we’re in. I plan to be a part of the solution. ‘Trump’s The Art Of The Deal inspired me to be a businessman’ Omar Navarro, 27, Torrance, California\\nWhen I was a kid, people would ask what I wanted to be when I grew up. I would tell them: I want to be president of the United States. If that doesn’t work out, I want to be a billionaire like Trump. In a way, I supported him long before he announced he was running for president. He was my childhood hero. I read The Art Of The Deal as a student; it inspired me to become a businessman. Now I own a small business and am running for Congress in California’s 43rd district. Trump built an empire and a strong brand that’s recognisable all around the world; he’s a household name and a world-class businessman. Almost anywhere you go, you can see the mark of Donald Trump on a building or property. When I see that, I see the American Dream. Some people ask me how I can support Donald Trump as the son of a Mexican and Cuban immigrants. They are categorising me. In this country we label people: Hispanic, African American, Asian, Caucasian. We separate and divide people into social categories based on race, ethnicity, gender and creed. To me, this is a form of racism. I’m proud of my Hispanic heritage but I’m an American, full stop. Like all immigrants, my parents came to this country for a better opportunity. But they did it legally. They didn’t cut the line. They assimilated to the American way of life, learned English and opened small businesses. Why should we allow people to skirt the law? Imagine making a dinner reservation and arriving at the restaurant to find out that another family has been seated at your table. How is that fair? We have to have laws and as a country we must enforce those laws. A society without laws is just anarchy. If someone invited you to their house and asked you to remove your shoes would you keep them on? If we don’t enforce the rules, why would anyone respect them? I believe Donald Trump will enforce the rules. ‘He has taken a strong stand against abortion’ Jimena Rivera, 20, student at the University of Texas at Brownsville\\nI’m Mexican, so I don’t have a vote, but I support Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who opposes abortion. He may have wavered in the beginning, but since becoming the nominee he has taken a strong stand against abortion. Hillary Clinton is running as the leader of a party that has pushed a very pro-choice platform. Even Democrats like her running mate, Tim Kaine, who is a devout Catholic, compromise their faith to support abortion. I don’t always agree with his positions on immigration. I see the border wall every day. I’m not convinced that it’s effective. The people who want to cross will find a way. I don’t think it’s right that they do, but most of them are looking for a better way of life. A wall won’t stop them. ‘Lower taxes and less regulation will create more jobs’ Marissa Desilets, 22, Palm Springs, California\\nI am a proud Hispanic conservative Republican woman. I became politically engaged as a political science and economics major at university. By my junior year, I was a member of the campus Republicans’ club. As a student of economics, I am very impressed with Trump’s economic agenda. I believe we must cut taxes for everyone and eliminate the death tax. Lowering taxes and reeling back regulations will create more jobs – meaning more tax-paying Americans. This in turn will generate more revenue for the Treasury. I also support Trump because he favours strong leadership and promised to preserve the constitution of the United States. We must have a rule of law in this country. We must close our open borders. Like Trump says: “a nation without borders is not a nation.” This doesn’t mean we should not allow any immigrants. We should welcome new immigrants who choose to legally enter our beautiful country. This won’t be the case if Hillary Clinton becomes president. I would expect the poor to become poorer and our country to become divided. I believe that liberals’ reckless domestic spending will bankrupt our future generations. I refuse to support a party that desires to expand the government and take away my civil liberties. ‘He has gone through so many divorces, yet raised such a close-knit family’ Dr Alexander Villicana, 80, Pasadena, California\\nI am an example of the opportunities this country has to offer. My parents came from Mexico at the turn of the 20th century. They were not educated but they worked hard to make a better life for us and it paid off. I went to school and studied cosmetic surgery. Now I work as a plastic surgeon and have been in practice for the last 40 years. I have a beautiful family and my health. I am Hispanic – but I am a citizen of the United States and I feel very patriotic for this country that has given me so much. I’m supporting Trump because I agree with his vision for our economy. He has experience at the negotiating table, so he knows what to do to create jobs and increase workers’ salaries. In Trump’s America people would be rewarded for their hard work rather than penalised with hefty taxes. The security of our nation is a top priority for me. I think it would be impossible to deport 11 million people who are here illegally, but we have to do a better job of understanding who is in our country and who is trying to come into our country. A lot of what Trump says, especially about security and immigration, is twisted by the media. What he said about Mexicans, for example, that wasn’t negative – it was the truth. There are Mexicans bringing over drugs and perpetrating rapes. But what he also said – and the media completely ignored – is that many Mexicans are good people coming over for a better quality of life. He may be blunt and occasionally offensive but I find him likable. I was so impressed by Trump and his family at the Republican National Convention. It’s hard for me to imagine that someone who has gone through so many divorces has managed to raise such a close-knit family. None of his children had to work and yet they spoke with eloquence and integrity about their father. ‘When Trump is harsh about Mexicans, he is right’ Francisco Rivera, 43, Huntington Park, California\\nPeople ask me how I can support Donald Trump. I say, let me tell you a story. I was in line at the movie theatre recently when I saw a young woman toss her cupcake into a nearby planter as if it were a trash can. I walked over to her and said, “Honey, excuse me, does that look like a garbage can to you?” And you know what she told me? “There’s already trash in the planter, so what does it matter?” I asked her what part of Mexico she was from. She seemed surprised and asked how I knew she was from Mexico. “Look at what you just did,” I told her. “Donald Trump may sound harsh when he speaks about Mexicans, but he is right. It’s people like you that make everyone look bad.” I moved from Mexico with my family when I was seven. I still carry a photo of my brother and I near our home, to remind people how beautiful the city once was. Now I spend my time erasing graffiti from the walls and picking up trash. Sixty years ago, we accepted immigrants into our country who valued the laws, rules and regulations that made America the land of opportunity. Back in those days, people worked hard to improve themselves and their communities. I’m tired of living in a lawless country. It’s like we put a security guard at the front door, but the Obama administration unlocked the back door. And I have seen what my own people have done to this country. They want to convert America into the country they left behind. This country has given me so many opportunities I wouldn’t have had if my mom had raised her family in Mexico. I want America to be great again, and that’s why in November I am going to vote for Donald Trump. ‘I voted for Obama twice, but Hillary gets a free pass’ Teresa Mendoza, 44, Mesa, Arizona\\nIn my day job I am a real estate agent but every now and then I dabble in standup comedy. Comedy used to be a safe space. You could say whatever you wanted to and it was understood that it was meant to make people laugh. Now everything has to be politically correct. You can’t say “Hand me the black crayon” without someone snapping back at you: “What do you mean by that?” Donald Trump offended a lot of people when he gave the speech calling [Mexicans] rapists and criminals but he didn’t offend me. I was a liberal Democrat all my life. Before this I voted for Obama twice. I wanted to be a part of history. If it wasn’t for Obamacare and the ridiculous growth of our federal government, I’d probably still be a Democrat, asleep at the wheel. But I woke up and realised I’m actually much more in line with Republicans on major policy points. I like to joke that I’m an original anchor baby. My parents came from Mexico in the 1970s under the Bracero work programme making me a California-born Chicana. We later became US citizens. But now that I’m a Republican, Hillary Clinton is trying to tell me I’m “alt-right”. It’s strange isn’t it? All of a sudden I’m a white nationalist. My sons and I go back and forth. They don’t like Trump. But it’s what they’re hearing in school, from their friends and teachers, who are all getting their news from the same biased news outlets. I’m very concerned about the role the media is taking in this election. The networks sensationalise and vilify Trump while they give Hillary Clinton a free pass. It amazes me. I don’t care if Trump likes to eat his fried chicken with a fork and a knife. I do care that Clinton has not been held responsible for the Benghazi attacks.', 'A 20-year-old Briton has been jailed for 12 months by a Las Vegas court for trying to grab a police officer’s gun at a Donald Trump rally in June. Michael Steven Sandford, who has autism, tried to get the weapon at a Las Vegas casino where Trump was addressing supporters during the presidential campaign. He allegedly told officers after his arrest that he planned to shoot Trump.\\nSandford, of Dorking, Surrey, pleaded guilty in September to charges of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function. He could have faced up to 20 years in prison if he had been convicted at trial of both charges. Judge James Mahan told him: “You have a medical problem. You should not be ashamed or embarrassed about it. You need medication. “You’re not a hardened criminal. You’re not evil or a sociopath like a lot of people we have. I don’t think you wanted to kill anybody. This was just some crazy stunt that your mind told you to do.” A tearful Sandford told the court: “I know saying sorry is not enough. I really do feel awful about what I did. I wish there was some way to make things better. I have cost taxpayers so much money. I feel terrible.” Addressing the judge, he added: “I’m really sorry to you and the court for taking up so much time.” As he has already been in custody since being arrested, he is not expected to have to spend a further 12 months behind bars. Sandford did not get hold of the gun before he was arrested, and no shots were fired. Court documents say that Sandford told a federal agent that he drove from California to Las Vegas with a plan to kill Trump. His UK lawyer, Saimo Chahal, QC, of Bindmans, had argued that Sandford was delusional at the time. The court papers also stated that Sandford had gone to a gun range in Las Vegas to learn how to fire a gun, which he had not done before. Sandford told police he had been in the US for 18 months before the incident. He was unemployed, living out of his car and in the US illegally. As well as autism, he also has obsessive compulsive disorder, severe depression, seizures, cardiac issues and Crohn’s disease, according to his family. His mother Lynne Sandford, who travelled to the US for the sentencing with her mother Christine and four-year-old daughter Jessica, had appealed to the judge to allow her son to serve his sentence in the UK so he could get the right psychiatric help. The family has launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover the legal costs relating to their bid to bring Sandford back to the UK to serve his sentence. “Michael’s actions were completely out of character. He is an extremely vulnerable young man and we believe that he needs to return to the UK in order to serve his sentence,” his mother wrote. Until sentencing, Lynne Sandford had only seen her son once since he was arrested. “During my visit to Las Vegas, I learned that Michael had been on suicide watch several times following numerous mental breakdowns,” she wrote. “‘Suicide watch’ in the US involves being kept in isolation 24/7 for up to a week at a time. Other prisoners are allowed books, but these are taken away from Michael while he is in isolation. Michael isn’t even allowed toilet paper while he is in isolation.”', 'By once again testing China’s nerves over Taiwan, Donald Trump is injecting a dangerous element of uncertainty and unpredictability into US relations with Beijing – the exact opposite of what American presidents usually try to do when dealing with potentially hostile rival superpowers. Trump’s public questioning of the long-established One China policy, under which Washington accepts that Taiwan is part of China, is a knife in the troubled heart of the US-China relationship established by Richard Nixon’s famous “opening to China” and his groundbreaking meeting with Mao Zedong in 1972. At the same time as riling China, Trump is fomenting a triangular strategic upheaval by building bridges to Russia. His expected choice of Vladimir Putin’s buddy and Exxon Mobil oilman Rex Tillerson as secretary of state is the latest straw in the wind. In effect, Trump is playing Nixon’s “China card” in reverse. His approach can be summed up: make nice with Russia, talk tough to China. Trump’s willingness to upset the global balance of power and roll the strategic dice so dramatically heralds a new age of uncertainty in international relations. It potentially affects ongoing crises and looming controversies from Syria and Ukraine to Tibet and the Arctic, where US and Russian oil companies have shared interests. The symbolic importance to China’s communist leaders of reunification with Taiwan – the last bastion of Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalists in the civil war that followed Japan’s defeat in 1945 – cannot be overestimated. They regard Taiwan as a renegade province and its sovereignty as non-negotiable.\\nTrump’s statement on Sunday linking continued US adherence to the One China policy to other problematic issues, such as trade and currency, will be deeply alarming for Beijing. In its toughest riposte to date, Geng Shuang, foreign ministry spokesman, said “the sound and steady growth of China-US relations [was] out of the question” were Trump to persist with his approach. “We urge the incoming US administration … to properly deal with Taiwan-related matters in a prudent manner,” Geng said. Trump and prudence are not traditional bedfellows. Far from soothing Beijing’s fears following his protocol-shredding telephone call with Taiwan’s president, he deliberately escalated the row. Maybe Trump was trying to justify his earlier gaffe; maybe his sense of self-importance was punctured. Nobody could tell him who he may and may not speak to, he said. Or maybe Trump was placing China on notice that unless he obtained more balanced trade and jobs, the US would deem all aspects of the bilateral relationship – including regional security, China’s military buildup and cooperation over the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme – up for review. “We’re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don’t tax them, with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing, and frankly with not helping us at all with North Korea,” Trump said. “You have North Korea, you have nuclear weapons, and China could solve that problem and they’re not helping us at all.” Chinese leaders – from the president, Xi Jinping, down – have not yet decided how to deal with Trump. His post-election outbursts have evidently caught them off-guard. State media and tame pro-government academics are increasingly aggressive in their response. But party bosses still seem to be hoping things will calm down as Trump settles into office. That may be a serious misreading. Trump is already engaged in a furious battle with his own intelligence community, notably the CIA, and moderate Republican and Democratic members of Congress. There is little reason to believe he will tread more gently with with his favourite campaign target, China – at least in the short term. But there could also be method in the apparent madness. By seeking warmer ties with Russia, Trump may be hoping China catches a cold. This is the identical gambit, played backwards, that was employed by Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his national security adviser, to clip the wings of the Soviet Union at the height of the cold war. On this reading, Trump is playing the “Russia card” against Beijing. The risks that this strategy will backfire are huge. Xi is not the sort of leader to appease Trump; China has its own pragmatic, business-like relationship with Putin’s Russia; the two countries will not be easily estranged. And in any case, China does not accept the justice of Trump’s claims about currency manipulation and unfair tariffs. And then there is Taiwan. Xi may decide instead to meet fire with fire. Threatening Chinese military air manoeuvres close to Taiwan and the Ryukyu islands at the weekend – the second such event in two weeks – led to a rapid mobilisation of Taiwanese and Japanese air and missile forces. A connection between this and Trump’s verbal provocations is not proven. But it seems likely. In the coming age of uncertainty, nobody knows what comes next.', 'Over the weekend, Anna Wintour, the formidable editor-in-chief of US Vogue, was compelled to issue an apology after being overheard on a train panning Donald Trump, saying his foundation had achieved nothing, and that he would use his presidency to further his personal brand. “I immediately regretted my comments,” she told the Sunday Mirror, “and I apologise. I hope he’ll be a successful president for us all.” This apology came on the same day Vogue’s younger, savvier sister, Teen Vogue, published an excoriating op-ed on Trump, which quickly went viral. Headlined “Donald Trump is gaslighting America” the piece by Lauren Duca explained the president-elect’s strategy of lying so frequently and egregiously that the public are left not knowing what is true or false (a manipulative technique known as “gaslighting” after the 1938 play Gas Light). Trump’s “rise to power,” writes Duca, “has awakened a force of bigotry by condoning and encouraging hatred, but also by normalising deception.” It’s not quite the mad-about-the-boy talk one might think of when it comes to teen magazines and, by extension, their readers. But Duca’s piece isn’t a blip for Teen Vogue. While other magazines are publishing ethically dubious trend pieces on the “fashy” haircuts of white nationalist Richard Spencer and his peers, Teen Vogue has been ensuring its readers know that Vice-President-elect Mike Pence voted against the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and once said, referring to abortion law, that he “longed for the day that Roe v Wade is sent to the ash heap of history”.\\nThere are a few reasons the magazine, which is printed quarterly but has a wide web and social media presence, has come out fighting. First, it doesn’t have to toe the same line many publishers do, terrified of losing access to Trump. Teen Vogue probably does not have access to Trump. When the tiny-fisted tantrum of a man rips press credentials from outlets such as the Washington Post for daring to ask questions, the danger is that the press will be cowed into taking an artificially softer line. Teen Vogue isn’t caught up in that game. Second, teen mags and kids’ books and TV shows have always been more renegade than adults give them credit for: think JK Rowling smuggling political lessons for muggles into her books, or the pro-immigration story of Paddington Bear. It used to be that adults didn’t notice this subterfuge because they weren’t paying attention; now the misapprehension comes more from the pronounced tendency to dismiss the thoughts and culture of Generation Y and all who come afterwards. But perhaps the main reason for Teen Vogue’s success is the tag team of Phil Picardi, digital editorial director, and Elaine Welteroth, editor. Welteroth is a rare editor of colour in a glossy magazine industry weighed down as much by whiteness as by insert advertising. At 29, she became the youngest editor-in-chief in Condé Nast history. Since Picardi and Welteroth took the helm, Teen Vogue’s journalism has included a video report from the Standing Rock protest, a piece about recreational drugs being used to treat depression, and the exposure of homophobic tweets of Republican politicians. Duca’s op-ed might have gone viral, partly due to an element of surprise – Teen Vogue published this! – but it isn’t surprising to those of us who have been reading the magazine. The title hasn’t been stripped of lighter, fashion content because – shocking as this is – young women can be interested in both. Perhaps it isn’t surprising that outlets with younger staff and readers (see also: US Cosmopolitan) are taking a more progressive editorial line, given that the demographic is more diverse in race and sexuality, so has more invested in that worldview. There’s been a lot of hand-wringing about who is or isn’t responsible for Trump, and what to do about him, but Teen Vogue proves that, as with mislaid keys and where you had them last, perhaps the answers aren’t always quite where you looked before. • This article has been amended to include reference to Phil Picardi and his role at TeenVogue.com', 'Democrats spent 17 months branding Donald Trump as fundamentally unqualified to be president, a candidate whose campaign was rooted in racism, xenophobia and misogyny. Now they are preparing to work with him in the aftermath of a demoralizing election loss that plunged the Democratic party into an uncertain future.\\nAs Democrats look to pick up the pieces from the outcome of the 8 November election, a debate is only just beginning on exactly when, how and at what cost they should cross the aisle to support a president-elect who marginalized some of their core constituencies.\\nBut in an election where working-class white voters were integral to handing Trump the keys to the presidency, there is also widespread agreement among Democrats that a key faction of their base defected to Republicans because Trump successfully co-opted their economic message. And reclaiming it might require their cooperation with the same man they decried as one of the most divisive candidates in modern history. In the wake of the election, Democrats on Capitol Hill said they were adopting a wait-and-see approach to the incoming administration and how Trump’s cabinet appointees might signal the contours of his agenda. But many were also quick to put a bitterly fought election behind them, acknowledging the party’s failure to reach out to voters in the so-called Rust Belt, which swung in Trump’s favor despite representing a Democratic stronghold in years past. “My job now is not to comment on [Trump’s] campaign,” said Missouri senator Claire McCaskill, who faces re-election in 2018 and was just named the top Democrat on the Senate committee on homeland security. “My job now is to figure out where I can work with Republicans, including the president-elect, to do good work on behalf of the people I represent. “Clearly we’ve fought for working people as long as I’ve been a Democrat and clearly a lot of them don’t believe us.” Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia and another vulnerable incumbent in 2018, is scheduled to meet with Trump early next week and has been floated as a possible cabinet pick. Hailing from an overwhelmingly red state, the senator has often broken with Democrats and once described himself as “fiscally responsible and conservative”. “Party lines do not scare me whatsoever,” Manchin said. “I just want to get something accomplished.” The predicament facing Democrats is not simply Trump’s stunning defeat of Hillary Clinton in the presidential race, but the continued Republican control of Congress. The party had hoped last month to regain control of the US Senate and pick up at least some seats in the Republican-led House of Representatives. Instead, both chambers remain under Republican control. The GOP is also favored to further expand its majorities in the 2018 midterm elections. And then there are the Republican victories that have swept Democrats from state governorships and legislatures over the past six years. The abysmal state of affairs has led to a pitched battle over who will lead the party in the Trump era, already a vessel for the wider debate about where Democrats went wrong in recent election cycles. And that fight is being waged as the party mulls the next leader of the Democratic National Committee. Representative Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress and a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has emerged as an early favorite in the contest. He has the blessing of progressive champions and party leaders, including support from Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate minority leader, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. On Thursday, AFL-CIO, one of the largest and most high-profile labor unions in the country, endorsed him, calling him a “proven leader”. On a biting Wednesday morning in Washington, Ellison was introduced to a cheering crowd of minimum- and low-wage federal contract workers at a rally near Trump’s new hotel as an “organizer in his heart of hearts” who has “walked with us” on the picket line. “Politics is nowhere near as important as being in the street, being active, fighting back and raising your voice,” Ellison said to the hundreds of workers gathered in Freedom Plaza, waving posters and American flags. Ellison was an early supporter of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary, and has championed a similar populist economic agenda since his election to Congress a decade ago As a lawmaker from Minnesota, Ellison’s supporters say he embodies the sort of energizing figure who can heal the party divisions by appealing to working-class voters across racial lines. To them, the congressman, with his activist credentials and organizer roots, is just the person to orient the party. “They talk about white working class – absolutely we are there for our white brothers and sisters,” Ellison said at the rally, his voice building as he continued. “But for our black ones too. For our brown ones too. And women too. For men too. For Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, people of all faiths, we are together and we aren’t going to let nobody pull us apart.” But Ellison is facing increasing opposition from Jewish groups and labor unions who are uneasy with the Minnesota congressman’s past remarks on Israel and earlier writings on the Nation of Islam. He is being challenged by New Hampshire Democratic party chairman Ray Buckley and South Carolina Democratic party chairman Jaime Harrison.\\nMeanwhile, inside the halls of the Senate, the progressive wing of the party made gains in the Democratic leadership. Sanders and Warren were both named to an expanded 10-member Democratic leadership team that will tailor the party’s outreach to voters, as well as its messaging and agenda under Trump. “We heard the American people loud and clear,” Schumer told reporters on Capitol Hill. “They felt that the government wasn’t working for them. They felt that the economy was rigged against them in many places and that the government was too beholden to big money and special interests.” Schumer also made clear there was room to achieve common ground with Trump, particularly on issues such as infrastructure spending, raising the minimum wage and renegotiating trade deals. The sentiment was echoed by Democrats who signaled they would work with the president-elect if he was serious about following up on the promises he made to working class voters about creating jobs and increasing wages.\\n“If he’s going to try to build roads and bridges, we’d be fools to say no,” said Connecticut senator Chris Murphy. “We don’t have to foreclose the possibility of finding some small, meaningful areas of agreement.” In the House of Representatives, however, there was less consensus over the direction of Democrats whose influence has only grown smaller since the party lost control of the chamber in 2010. Although Nancy Pelosi was re-elected as the House minority leader, 63 Democrats opposed the veteran California lawmaker. She was challenged by Tim Ryan, a 43-year-old congressman from Ohio who had argued that choosing the same leadership would be yet another slap in the face to the industrial midwest that gravitated to Trump. Democrats in both chambers insisted that the focus on tactics and internal squabbles was overblown, and expressed confidence in their ability to go to battle against Trump as a unified party. They also maintained that working with Trump where appropriate would not legitimize the worst aspects of his campaign, such as his attacks on minorities and civil liberties. “There’s going to be no shortage of big, life-or-death fights with the Trump administration next year,” Murphy said. A Senate Democratic leadership aide, who requested anonymity to discuss the strategy more freely, said Trump was an anomaly because he did not campaign on a traditional Republican platform. It was entirely likely, the aide said, that opposition to some of Trump’s proposals might stem from Republicans and not Democrats. But, the aide added: “If he continues down this dark, divisive rhetoric we will call him out on that every single time.”', 'Donald Trump and Nicola Sturgeon have spoken for the first time since the US election. The president-elect called Scotland’s first minister on Friday for what aides described as “a brief introductory conversation”. According to a Scottish government statement, Sturgeon and Trump discussed “the longstanding relationship between Scotland and the United States”. “The first minister offered her congratulations and, reflecting on the letter she sent him following the election, expressed her belief in the values Scotland and the United States share.” Immediately following Trump’s shock election victory last month, and echoing other Scottish party leaders’ misgivings about the result, Sturgeon said she was “not prepared to be a politician that maintains a diplomatic silence in the face of racism, misogyny or hatred of any kind”. The US election result has particular significance in Scotland, where Trump’s heaviest overseas spending has taken place on two prominent golf resorts, in Aberdeenshire and in Ayrshire. He has had a volatile relationship with locals and with the former first minister Alex Salmond, as well as engaging in a lengthy legal wrangle over a windfarm development off the coast of his Aberdeenshire course.\\nAddressing the Holyrood chamber at first minister’s questions two days after the US election, Sturgeon described some of the views expressed by Trump during his campaign as “deeply abhorrent”, and argued: “There is no doubt whatsoever that many people feel economically alienated, but we must never allow those legitimate concerns to give a veneer of respectability to racism, misogyny and intolerance.” But she said that, while she regretted the result, she respected the decision of the American people and wanted to engage “positively and constructively” with the next US administration. Days later, she formally wrote to Trump to congratulate him on his victory and again emphasised the longstanding ties between Scotland and the US. Sturgeon stripped Trump of his honorary role as a Scottish business ambassador last year, after his attack on Mexicans and Muslims, describing his rhetoric as “obnoxious and offensive”.', 'Donald Trump will not give up his role as an executive producer of The Celebrity Apprentice, the reality TV show’s studio said on Thursday, confirming a continuing business entanglement of the president-elect but not its details. Trump’s name will appear in the credits of the show, studio MGM told Variety magazine on Thursday, after the name of show creator Mark Burnett and before that of the program’s new host, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trump hosted the show for more than a decade before his presidential campaign, during which NBC, the network that airs the show, broke ties with him over his claims that Mexican people are “bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and their rapists”.\\nA spokeswoman for MGM did not immediately reply to questions about the arrangement. The studio did not disclose to Variety any terms of the deal except that it would pay Trump’s fees, and that NBC would not. A spokesman for Trump’s transition team did not reply to a request for clarification. During a string of meetings last month to interview potential cabinet members of the next White House, Trump met with Ari Emanuel, his agent while he was on The Apprentice and the brother of Rahm Emanuel, former White House chief of staff for Barack Obama. Trump gave no details about that meeting, only telling reporters outside a New Jersey golf club that the meeting was “very good. Great guy. Great friend of mine.” Burnett has denied that he supported Trump’s presidential campaign, and said in October that he and his wife “reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign”. The producer also denied that he suppressed leaked unaired footage or audio from Trump’s time on the show.\\nA former contestant, Summer Zervos, is one of several woman who has accused Trump of kissing and groping her. Trump bragged about being able to grab and kiss women without consent in leaked audio from a 2005 appearance on Access Hollywood, near the peak of his fame from The Apprentice.\\nThe president-elect has refused to make a clean break from his sprawling and opaque business interests, instead exploring what legal loopholes could allow his daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to play roles of some kind in the government. He reportedly intends to keep a stake in his company, while formally handing control to his two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. He has so far declined to fully divest from the holdings, as the Office of Government Ethics has advised, and threatens to test the limits of US law on conflicts of interest. During the presidential election, Trump’s campaign falsely said that handing control to his children would serve as a “blind trust”. Since beginning transition work with the Obama administration, Trump has met with Indian business partners, his Washington hotel has courted diplomats, and his potential interests in Taiwan and Argentina come under scrutiny. Breaking with four decades of political tradition, Trump has also refused to release his tax returns, keeping secret the extent of his wealth or potential conflicts of interest in the US and abroad.', 'In a fitting end to a year in which he dominated TV screens and front pages, Donald Trump has been named Time’s person of the year. The annual cover on which the magazine recognises the person who “for better or for worse … has done the most to influence the events of the year” pictures the president-elect in his New York tower with the headline, Donald Trump: President of the Divided States of America.\\nThe editor-in-chief of Time, Nancy Gibbs, wrote in the issue: “So which is it this year: better or worse? The challenge for Donald Trump is how profoundly the country disagrees about the answer. “It’s hard to measure the scale of his disruption … For reminding America that demagoguery feeds on despair and that truth is only as powerful as the trust in those who speak it, for empowering a hidden electorate by mainstreaming its furies and live-streaming its fears, and for framing tomorrow’s political culture by demolishing yesterday’s, Donald Trump is Time’s 2016 person of the year.” In an interview accompanying the cover, Trump says he does not believe Russia interfered in the election, defends his claim of widespread illegal voting, and insists that despite his wealth he represents “the workers of the world”, who “love me”.\\nOn allegations made by the US government that Russia hacked the Democratic national committee’s emails, Trump tells Time: “I don’t believe they interfered … It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.” The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who was Time’s pick in 2007, was on the 11-person shortlist for 2016 compiled by the Time editors, as was the Trump associate and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Trump’s defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, the singer Beyoncé and Mark Zuckerberg, who previously occupied the cover in 2010, were also shortlisted.\\nDespite his ability to polarise opinion, Trump is far from the most controversial choice in the 90 years Time has picked its person of the year. Both Stalin and Hitler took the title in the late 1930s, with Stalin appearing again in 1942, and the Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini has also featured. Known until 1999 as man of the year, the magazine’s annual issue has occasionally stretched the definition of person, putting both “you” and “whistleblowers” on the cover in recent years. Last year’s pick was the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the sitting president, Barack Obama, appeared both as president-elect in 2008 and after securing a second term in 2012. Obama is also appearing on a cover this month in a joint interview with his wife, Michelle, for People magazine in which the first lady, asked how she had spent election night, said: “I went to bed. I don’t like to watch the political discourse; I never have. I barely did with him [Obama].” She told the magazine that, like her husband, she was prepared to work with Trump to prepare him for the presidency. “This is our democracy, and this is how it works,” she said. “We are ready to work with the next administration and make sure they are as successful as they can be. Because that’s what’s best for this country.”', 'Donald Trump has laid out a US military policy that would avoid interventions in foreign conflicts and instead focus heavily on defeating Islamic State militancy. “We will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn’t be involved with,” the president-elect said on Tuesday night in Fayetteville, near Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina. “Instead our focus must be on defeating terrorism and destroying Isis, and we will.”\\nTrump’s remarks came a few hours after Barack Obama delivered what was billed as the final national security address of his presidency. Speaking in Tampa, Florida, Obama did not mention Trump by name – but implicitly warned his successor to dispense with overheated rhetoric in favor of a nuanced approach to the war on terror, and to avoid actions that could give false legitimacy to Isis as the “vanguard of a new world order”. Obama told a room of service members at MacDill air force base: “Rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world, we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat, and we have to pursue a smart strategy than can be sustained.”\\nDuring the course of his campaign, Trump vowed to “bomb the shit out of” Islamic State and routinely declined to offer a counter-terrorism strategy by claiming that doing so would reveal the country’s plans before the enemy. He also suggested terrorists were streaming across the US border disguised as refugees, and proposed aggressive policies that included a ban on all Muslim immigration to the US. Trump, making the latest stop on a so-called “thank you” tour of states critical to his 8 November election win, introduced his choice for defense secretary, General James Mattis, to a large crowd in Fayetteville, near the Fort Bragg military base, which has deployed soldiers to 90 countries around the world. He vowed a strong rebuilding of the US military, which he suggested had been stretched too thin. Instead of investing in wars, he said, he would spend money to build up America’s aging roads, bridges and airports. But he also wanted to boost spending on the military. To help pay for his buildup, Trump pledged to seek congressional approval for lifting caps on defense spending that were part of “sequestration” legislation cutting spending across the board. “We don’t want to have a depleted military because we’re all over the place fighting in areas that we shouldn’t be fighting in. It’s not going to be depleted any longer,” he said. Trump said any nation that shared his goals would be considered a US partner. “We don’t forget. We want to strengthen old friendships and seek out new friendships,” he said. But the policy of “intervention and chaos” must come to an end. While US armed forces are deployed in far-flung places around the globe, they are only involved currently in active combat in the Middle East – Iraq and Syria for the most part. “We will build up our military not as an act of aggression, but as an act of prevention,” he said. “In short we seek peace through strength.” Trump used similar rhetoric during the election campaign when he railed against the war in Iraq. Unusually for a Republican, Trump not only loudly expressed his dismay at George W Bush’s 2003 intervention but falsely claimed that he opposed it at the time and accused Bush of lying about the presence of weapons of mass destruction. Trump has long expressed his skepticism about US foreign intervention in activities that he has labeled “nation building.” He told the Guardian in October 2015: “We’re nation-building. We can’t do it. We have to build our own nation. We’re nation-building, trying to tell people who have [had] dictators or worse for centuries how to run their own countries. “Assad is bad,” Trump added of the Syrian president. “Maybe these people could be worse.” In Fayetteville, Trump did not explicitly repeat his pledge to bar Muslims from coming to the US but maintained he would “suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed”. He described James Mattis as the right person for the job and urged Congress to approve a waiver to let him take on the civilian position of defense secretary. Under US law a military leader must be retired for seven years before becoming eligible for the post. Taking the microphone, Mattis said: “I look forward to being the civilian leader as long as the Congress gives me the waiver and the Senate votes to consent.” “We’re going to get you that waiver,” Trump replied, returning to the microphone. “If you don’t get that waiver there are going to be a lot of angry people.”', 'His arms are still absurdly muscular – his T-shirt sleeves straining over his biceps, Popeye-style – but Mark Wahlberg’s handshake is gentle. “Hey,” he says, slumped in his chair in a central London hotel, looking an unpromising mix of bored and glum. The glumness is because his wife and four children are flying back to their home in Los Angeles as we speak. Also, at the age of 45, he is only “just coming round to London”, he says in a tone that strongly suggests this acceptance of the city is, at most, at the mid-point stage. “The first time I came here, I just couldn’t …” he trails off, before citing the usual American criticisms of Britain: the food and the weather. “Back then, the only place I’d been besides Boston was New York, and I’d pretty much only eaten my mom’s cooking,” he concedes, sounding like Boston and mom’s cooking are all he still needs, really.\\nThis anecdote, while reinforcing Wahlberg’s image of the kid from the streets done good, also acts as a reminder of just how long he has been in the public eye, being shuttled around the world first by record companies, then film-makers while pining for the basketball courts back home. It hs been 25 years since he crunched his abs as Marky Mark with the unforgettably named Funky Bunch. Since then, he has made the tricky crossover from teenage heartthrob to respected actor and producer, and at first glance, Wahlberg now looks like a typical Hollywood A-lister. His gently feathered hair, which brushes his shoulders, looks like it was cut by a stylist who charges three figures, and his deep tan and muscles suggest a man whose time is his own. But Wahlberg has always been a more surprising prospect than appearances suggest. For a start, the reason he seems so bored is because, he says, right off the bat, “I never really like talking about myself,” which is not something you hear often from a celebrity. He perks up any time he can deflect the conversation to an anecdote about someone else in his life. One of those people, it turns out, is Donald Trump.\\nWe are meeting the morning after the first presidential debate and Wahlberg, while eager to watch the highlights, refuses to say who he will be voting for. “But I’ve played golf with Donald Trump,” he says, spotting an escape from this discussion about his political preferences. Obviously, I bite the bait. How was he, I ask? “He’s an OK golfer,” he says, and the faint praise is damning. “I’ve gotten to know him a little bit since, at various occasions. I’ve never met Hillary Clinton.” It turns out that Wahlberg and Trump met almost a decade ago at one of those weird celebrity golf events that always seem to be happening in California or Florida. What did they talk about? “He was very Donald Trump-like, talking about the things that he does, things that he has, business interests, properties, stuff like that. But he wasn’t ever mean or rude. I don’t think he asked me too many personal questions, or about what I do.” Perhaps Ivanka explained to her dad who Wahlberg is, because Trump has since invited him back to play golf at his own events. “Yeah, it’s a little crazy where we are now,” is all Wahlberg says about the election in which his golf buddy is barely a breath away from the White House.\\nWahlberg is in London, suffering the weather and talking Trump, because he is promoting his latest film, Deepwater Horizon, the true story of the 2010 oil-rig explosion and spill crisis, the worst ever in the US. Wahlberg plays Mike Williams, the heroic lead character based on a real person, alongside Kurt Russell as the gruff ol’ boss and John Malkovich, who hams it up enjoyably as the BP rep, evil to an almost southern gothic extent. It is a strikingly harrowing disaster film and Wahlberg is in classic Wahlberg mode: the blue-collar hero, standing his ground against, on the one side, Malkovich’s scenery chewing and, on the other, the pyrotechnic special effects. Wahlberg’s career is remarkable in two respects: first, the sheer range of films he has made. There are the intense dramas (The Basketball Diaries, Boogie Nights, The Fighter, Broken City, The Departed, We Own the Night), the comedies (I Heart Huckabees, The Other Guys, Ted, Date Night), the action movies (Transformers: Age of Extinction, Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon). Wahlberg sinks himself so deeply into a role that you can easily forget who you are actually watching, which is not something you can say of most big-name actors (on some level I’d forgotten that the same guy who played Dirk Diggler was also the one who larked around with a talking teddy bear). This relates to the second point about Wahlberg: it is rarely noted how excellent he is at being the calm centre of a movie, often surrounded by flashier performers, from Christian Bale smoking crack in The Fighter to Jack Nicholson being Jack Nicholson in The Departed to that talking bear in Ted – and neither competing with them nor being overshadowed. “I just do my thing,” he says, most comfortable with self-deprecation when talking about his acting. But then he loosens up as he switches to producer mode (he produced, among others, The Fighter and Deepwater Horizon): “I’m thinking about the big picture, not my individual experience as an actor. I’ve seen actors who are like: ‘Oh God, this is my moment,’ and I don’t think it services the movie. You have to put the movie first.” Largely, I suspect, for this reason, Wahlberg has a tendency to be overlooked by critics and accolades, which shine instead upon his co-stars. He was nominated for a supporting actor Oscar for The Departed, but he was almost completely ignored for The Fighter, even though he’d spent four years training as a boxer for the role; the awards instead went to his co-stars, Bale and Melissa Leo. Does that not bug him? “Well, I come from the real world and you’re only as good as the people around you,” he says. “That’s always been my philosophy. I don’t know if it’s because of my background in sports, but I want the whole team to be good.” It is partly this lack of look-at-me starriness that has helped him retain a relative kind of normality in the eyes of the public, and there is a loose, “hey-I’m-just-a-guy” attitude to him in person. Whereas fellow Massachusetts boy Matt Damon is covered in Hollywood glitter, Wahlberg – despite being a celebrity for far longer – still has a coating of grit. “Look, I live in a big house, I drive a fancy car,” he says. “But I still feel like I’m gonna end up where I came from and as long as I can go there with my head held high and I’m welcomed back with open arms, then I’m OK.”\\nWahlberg, who grew up in the working-class area of Dorchester in Boston, is the youngest of nine siblings. If you want to see how close this family is then allow me to direct you to their rather extroardinary reality TV show called - what else? - Wahlburgers, which you almost certainly have never watched. Ostensibly made to promote the family’s restaurant franchise, Wahlburgers, now in its sixth series, is a rather pleasing antidote to Keeping Up with the Kardashians because, with the exception of the shots of Wahlberg’s LA house – which is, indeed, big and fancy – there is little here that’s aspirational. Whereas the Kardashians go shopping on Rodeo Drive, the Wahlberg matriarch, Alma, hunts for bargain shoes at a store called Frugal Fannies. It is more than a little odd to see Wahlberg, an A-lister, on this shonky reality show, but, he says simply: “It was an opportunity for the family to spend time together.” He talks about his childhood fondly, with his dad, a truck driver, taking him to see Steve McQueen movies on weekends. The full picture, however, was more complicated, to put it mildly. Wahlberg was suffering from drug addiction by the age of 13 and, while still a teenager, racially abused a group of black schoolchildren and beat a Vietnamese man with a stick. He also assaulted another Vietnamese man, punching him in the face. He pleaded guilty to assault and battery and served 45 days in prison. He sums up that period of his life as one in which “a lot of things happened and I made a lot of mistakes. But you try to live in the moment and look to the future.” The good thing that came out of it, he says, is that he connected with his Catholicism. “Everybody goes to jail and gets on their hands and knees and says: ‘Please God, if you get me out I promise I’ll never do it again.’ And of course, by the time you’re out, you fall back into the same habits. But something just kept me wanting to go a little bit more into it,” he says. Catholicism is still a major part of his life. He has a daily prayer routine “which I absolutely cannot miss” and any movie shooting schedules must accommodate his weekly trip to mass. “Everything good that has happened to me in my life, whether it’s meeting my wife or the births of my children, happened when I started focusing on my faith,” he says. He grins: “I sound like I’m in the recruiting office, don’t I? Here, I’ve got some brochures for you.” You’d have to work hard to recruit a New York Jew, I say. “Jesus was a Jew,” he replies with mock solemnity, enjoying switching from talking about himself to teasing banter. “I got a lotta New York Jews with me on this trip. Where’s Mr Weinstein? Bring him in! He’s my bubelah!”\\nBut if finding religion is a common path trod by ex-cons, the other route Wahlberg took after leaving prison was a little more unusual: he became a hugely successful model. Back in 1992 he posed, in full muscular glory, with Kate Moss for Calvin Klein in one of the most celebrated campaigns of all time. Moss has since said she deeply regretted the shoot. “I had a nervous breakdown when I was 17 or 18, when I had to go and work with Marky Mark,” she told Vanity Fair in 2012. “It didn’t feel like me at all. I felt really bad about straddling this buff guy. I didn’t like it. I couldn’t get out of bed for two weeks. I thought I was going to die.” Wahlberg was only 21 with no experience of the fashion world at the time. Did he feel similarly exploited? “Well, for me it was different,” he says. “The frustration that I felt was that when we talked about doing that, I was doing my music and they were like: ‘OK, it will be about what you’re doing,’ but then it became just about [the image]. “But you know, I still signed up for it, it was what it was and I think there were pros and cons. And Kate’s had a good career,” he concludes, which seems a tad dismissive of an 18-year-old’s nervous breakdown, but, as Wahlberg says, he is not really one for introspection or reflection. There is a distinct smack of the guy’s guy about Wahlberg, the one who still raves about his mother’s bolognese and keeps his friends from home close. So close that two of them are on this trip to London with him. Does he always travel with his buddies? “Yeah! They may get fired for a short amount of time but they always come back. We’re not the most professional group,” Wahlberg says proudly. This part of his life was, of course, memorialised in the TV show and film Entourage, which he co-produced (“You take a swing and hope to hit a home run and sometimes you miss,” is how he sums up the widely panned film version.) But is it difficult when your life is so different from those of your friends that you can fire them? “Difficult?” he repeats, baffled. Yes, isn’t it awkward? “I don’t know, you’d have to ask them,” he shoots back, a little grumpily. He pauses for a few seconds: “No. Look, I think, my real friends are certainly happy for the success I’ve had. But I try to spread and share as much as possible.” On cue, one of his buddies comes back into the room with a salad and a drink for Wahlberg. Any remnants of Wahlberg’s boredom and glumness are gone. Instead, he becomes downright larky. “I have a major issue with adolescent behaviour with my friends,” says the Hollywood mogul, punching his patiently smiling friend in the shoulder, and I realise I am basically in Entourage. And suddenly, Wahlberg surprises me by being so unsurprising. Deepwater Horizon is released in the UK on 30 September', 'In April, Donald Trump pledged “at some point, I’ll be so presidential that you people will be so bored.” Despite being president-elect, it seems that particular pivot has yet to come. On the first day of his self-described “thank you tour”, Trump returned to his bombastic style on the stump at a half-full arena in Cincinnati. He bashed Hillary Clinton to chants of “lock her up” from the rowdy crowd while settling scores with the media and former rivals as well as announcing the nomination of former marine general James Mattis to be secretary of defense.\\nThe event came at the start of an unprecedented victory tour where Trump will hold campaign-style rallies across the country. Often, however, Trump still seemed to be fighting the campaign. He reminisced, “We did have a lot of fun fighting Hillary, didn’t we?” to chants of “lock her up” while criticizing conservative critics. The president-elect launched an attack on Evan McMullin, his independent, conservative third-party rival in the campaign: “What the hell was he trying to prove? I guess he wanted us to lose the supreme court.” Trump didn’t mention McMullin by name and simply called him “that guy”. The president-elect also expressed his displeasure towards Ohio’s Republican governor, former presidential rival John Kasich. Trump said of his win over Kasich in the Buckeye State: “We didn’t have much help at the top levels, and it turned out it didn’t matter,” and noted how Kasich eventually gave him a congratulatory phone call after the election. The Ohio governor didn’t vote for his party’s nominee and instead wrote in John McCain on election day. In a tweet, Kasich strategist John Weaver indirectly returned fire: “No tour, but thankful every day @JohnKasich shows us the #twopaths way with honor & integrity. #ItIsALongRoadWithoutATurn.” The president-elect also teased the crowd with his long-expected announcement that Mattis was his choice to head the Pentagon. “I don’t want to tell you to this, I refuse to tell you, don’t let it outside of this room. I will not tell you that one of our great, great generals, don’t let it outside, we are going to appoint Mad Dog Mattis as our secretary of defense, and we’re not announcing it until Monday so don’t tell it to anybody.” Trump also gave his usual tirade against “the dishonest media” and expressed his displeasure that it took television networks until after midnight on election day to call his win in Pennsylvania. Trump went on to boast of his win in the electoral college, but not the popular vote: “We won in a landslide. We didn’t have the press, the press was brutal.”\\nTrump began the rally with broad attacks on what he termed “globalism”. “There is no global anthem, no global currency,” he said. “We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.” Trump added: “Global is wonderful, but right now we want to focus on our national community.” The president-elect also cast blame for terrorist attacks on the admission of refugees into the United States. “These are threats that are stupidly created by our stupid politicians’ refugee programs,” Trump said. The venue was the same location where a packed house rained down boos towards the media at a Trump rally in mid-October. This time, the disdain for the press was far less visible in an arena that was half empty, in part because road closures due to the president-elect’s visit tied up traffic in the area. The rally happened as top staffers for every presidential candidate’s campaign met at Harvard’s institute of politics to discuss the campaign, resulting in fiery exchanges between former Clinton staffers and Trump aides. In one instance, Clinton’s former communications director, Jennifer Palmeiri, told Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway: “If providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician, I am proud to have lost. I would rather lose than win the way you guys did.” Conway was also asked about Trump’s recent untrue tweets about voter fraud. She said, “He’s president-elect so that’s presidential behavior.” If so, it means being presidential may not be so boring after all.', 'The reports are rolling in: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is dead. If you read the obituaries, most news outlets seem to agree that the cause of death was simple: the election of Donald Trump, who railed against the deal during his campaign. But the pundits have the story wrong. The real story is that an unprecedented, international uprising of people from across the political spectrum took on some of the most powerful institutions in the world, and won.\\nSure, Donald Trump – and Bernie Sanders’ – campaign focus on the TPP elevated US awareness about the pact, a wide-reaching international agreement negotiated by the Obama administration. But no single politician killed this deal. If not for the constant pressure from activists and civil society groups, the TPP would have become law long before the recent US election. But thanks to intense, creative and strategic organizing from the day the text was finalized in 2015, there was never a majority of support for the pact in Congress. That’s why it was never implemented. The TPP is a massive global deal that was negotiated in secret with hundreds of corporate advisers given special access while the public was locked out. It would have handed multinational corporations like Walmart, AT&T and Monsanto extraordinary new powers over everything from the wages we earn, to the way we use the internet, to the safety of the food we feed our children. Perhaps most shockingly, the TPP would have allowed corporations to sue governments before tribunals of three corporate lawyers, essentially creating an unaccountable, shadow legal system outside of our traditional courts to punish governments that pass laws that corporations don’t like. A simple agreement to lower tariffs and other anticompetitive barriers to trade wouldn’t have been so controversial. But big business couldn’t resist the urge to abuse the extreme secrecy surrounding the TPP negotiations to stuff the pact with a wishlist for policies they knew they could never pass through traditional means. That unchecked greed was the TPP’s demise. What emerged from the closed-door negotiations was more than 5,000 pages of policy so clearly against the public interest that it awakened a firestorm of opposition that swept the globe, and in the end, sent the TPP to its grave. While negotiations were still under way, tens of thousands of people joined mass protests in Japan, Peru, Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific Rim nations. They pushed back on the TPP’s worst provisions, held their leaders’ feet to the fire and dragged the talks out for years. This early wave of international resistance changed the game: it bought time for activists to organize an effective opposition in the US, which was seen as all-important in the global calculus of the Washington-led deal. If Congress did not ratify the TPP, it would die. In the meantime, an unlikely alliance was forming. Activists, farmers, labor unions, tech companies, environmentalists, economists, nurses, LGBTQ advocates, libertarians and librarians mounted an intense opposition to the “fast track” legislation that the White House needed to rush the final agreement through Congress. The coalition that formed grew from dozens, to hundreds, to literally thousands of organizations, many working together for the first time, ranging from Black Lives Matter to Doctors Without Borders to the Tea Party. We marched in the streets. We rallied outside the hotels and resorts that hosted the secret negotiations. Cancer patients protesting about the TPP’s impact on healthcare access engaged in civil disobedience and were arrested. Internet freedom activists mobilized thousands of websites for online protests that bombarded lawmakers with emails and phone calls. Academics picked apart leaked versions of the deal, and coordinated with advocates to launch a campaign to educate the public on its flaws. Hard-hitting activism and public outcry slowed the TPP down, and as a result, dragged it fully into the spotlight just as the US headed into a contentious election season. It wasn’t a coincidence that Donald Trump saw the TPP as a useful stump speech talking point. Widespread suffering caused by previous trade deals laid a strong foundation for skepticism, making President Obama’s devotion to the Wall Street-friendly deal, and Hillary Clinton’s previous support for it, a huge liability for the Democratic party. As more and more people learned about what the TPP really meant for them and their families, it became politically toxic, to the point that no major party candidate for president could openly support it. This was a sign that the TPP was on its deathbed, but with the threat of a last-minute push during the “lame duck” session after the election, we needed to be sure. So we targeted undecided lawmakers with protests and flew inflatable blimps outside their offices. We harnessed the power of music to draw huge crowds across the country to “Rock Against the TPP” concerts and teach-ins, taking our opposition to the TPP into the cultural mainstream. We tuned out the chorus of voices that told us that corporate power would always prevail in the end. And finally, we claimed our victory. Now more than ever, it’s crucial that Americans understand how the TPP was really defeated. An organized and educated public can take on concentrated wealth and power and win. With four years of new battles ahead of us, this is a story we must commit to memory, and a lesson we must take to heart.', 'The small town of Westbury in Tasmania is considering changing the name of its cricket ground to the Donald J Trump park in a gesture of friendship toward the US president-elect. Councillor John Temple suggested the name change at a Meander Valley council meeting this week, noting that Trump was “likely to be the greatest agent of change this century”. Despite the chortles of his fellow councillors, Temple assured Guardian Australia it was a genuine suggestion. He cited the importance of the Australia’s military alliance with the US and the relative exposure of Tasmania as an island, should anyone decide to attack.\\n“It is in our best interests to extend the hand of friendship to the new president of the United States, who is not a politician and will likely come at things from a different perspective,” he said. The response, Temple said, had been mixed. “The personal conversations I have had have all been positive,” he said. “I have seen things on Facebook calling me an idiot.” Temple said he suggested the cricket ground not because he believed Trump had any great affection for the sport, but because the oval, known for the giant stumps that serve as a gate to the grounds, happens to be opposite his workplace. According to local paper the Examiner, the extent of Trump’s interest in cricket is that he briefly followed former Australian test batsman Damien Martyn on Twitter. The Examiner noted Temple’s suggestion was followed by another question by councillor Bob Richardson, who sought official clarification on whether Trump had promised to “make America great again” or “make America grate again”. It’s presumed Richardson spelled the pun for the transcript. It is, Temple conceded, unlikely that naming an oval after Trump would induce the property mogul turned politician to visit the small town of 1,500. After all, there are so many other buildings bearing his name. If Trump did visit, he would be the most famous person to visit Westbury since 1954, when the Queen and Prince Philip drove through on their inaugural visit to Australia. According to Temple, some in the town still talk about it. It is anticipated a presidential visit would have a similar impact. There is precedent for renaming sporting areas in the Meander Valley council area, shire president Craig Perkins said. The Deloraine football ground changed its name to the Bendigo Bank football stadium after a particularly lucrative sponsorship deal. “Maybe if he [Trump] wanted to throw some dollars at the cricket club they would agree to change the name,” he said. Perkins said he had assumed Temple was joking and did not intend to pursue the suggestion, saying: “I would be surprised if that actually came to fruition.” But he said Trump was welcome to visit regardless. “If he wanted to come over I’m sure we could talk the cricket club into getting him in the batting line-up,” he said. “He wouldn’t be the starter, I don’t think.” Perkins said he had raised the idea with Trump on Twitter, but “he hasn’t replied yet”.\\nThe suggestion has been referred to the council’s workshopping committee.', 'I have only seen bits of The Walking Dead, that hugely popular American TV zombie drama which made a massive star of British actor Andrew Lincoln. But I am going off screen zombies generally: those shambling figures whose low-budget appearance makes them beloved of indie film-makers. Critics love to claim zombies represent undead consumerism. For me they are becoming a gurning cliche, and I wasn’t surprised to see the tiresome Jane Austen horror mashup Pride and Prejudice and Zombies has become 2016’s biggest box-office flop, losing $11.6m. And Forbes magazine this month carries the disturbing news that zombies played a part in the election of Donald Trump. It carries an interview with Jared Kusher, Trump’s super-smooth son-in-law, widely considered to be the incoming administration’s eminence grise. He masterminded the Trump campaign’s use of social media but also deployed traditional TV ads, targeting them much more carefully, identifying specific voter blocs. And when he wanted to hammer home his anti-immigration message, which TV show did Kushner choose? Well, it was … The Walking Dead. He apparently figured that people who thrill to the idea of battling sinister marauding monsters that look human, but aren’t really, will also be very sympathetic to building an enormous wall. Was he right? Was there a Walking Dead constituency for Trump? Maybe they’d better put some zombies in the White House for political balance. May’s shtick: Jam for some\\nLike celebrities who pick their own nicknames (such as Paul “The Guv’nor” Ince), politicians who try popularising their own catchphrases can find themselves on stony ground. John Major’s “back to basics” coincided with a flurry of sex scandals. Tony Blair’s New Labour tried us with the deeply annoying “big conversation”, that all-inclusive national debate which was abandoned after 9/11. And David Cameron gave it a go with his sensitive, volunteer-based “big society”, but later did not wish to discuss all those volunteer-run food banks. Theresa May is having more luck with her Middle England non-scroungers who are “just about managing”. BBC news announcers are doing her PR for her by always slowing down on pronouncing this supposedly zeitgeisty catchphrase so that we can fully appreciate it, in all its piquant buzzphrasey-ness, and the fact that it spells jam! The mingling of condescension and self-pity in this phrase is almost unbearable. I am just about managing not to lose my breakfast. Confessions of a water cutter As a sort-of regular swimmer, I am astonished by the new research from the Eindhoven University of Technology, which has found that it is better to swim with your fingers spread apart in the “rake” style. Since I was six, I have been swimming with fingers closed tight together, my hands each making a tense, shallow cup, on the commonsense grounds that this gives you a better push against the water. But no. Fingers apart in a claw gives you better drag and makes you up to 5% faster. This could be right. The historian Katherine Duncan-Jones once wrote a London Review of Books essay about the fact that she went swimming with latex socks on after an attack of athlete’s foot, and found herself very much impeded. The free individual movement of toes turns out to be vital to swimming. And perhaps it is the same with fingers. But it could be too late for me to change my ways, and I personally do the “rake” movement with my splayed fingers only after staggering out of the pool, clutching on the walls and locker doors, and finally making it to the cafeteria and clawing open a full-size tube Pringles.', 'Donald Trump’s unorthodox US presidential transition continued on Monday when he held talks with one of the most prominent supporters of leftwing Democrat Bernie Sanders. The president-elect’s first meeting of the day at Trump Tower in New York was with Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic maverick who endorsed the socialist Sanders during his unsuccessful primary battle with Hillary Clinton.\\nOver the past few days Trump has also held talks with Mitt Romney, who once branded him a “phony” but is now under consideration for possible secretary of state, Ted Cruz, whom he labelled “Lyin’ Ted” during the Republican primary campaign, and Democrat Michelle Rhee, the former schools chief of Washington, who is mooted as a possible education secretary. The celebrity businessman’s aides have characterised him as a deal maker who intends to cast the net wide for diverse talents. Barack Obama has called Trump “pragmatic”, not an “ideologue”, while former secretary of state Henry Kissinger said he would be a unique president because he “has no obligation to any particular group”. He is entertaining both loyalists and rivals, although his three appointments so far – Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Mike Pompeo for CIA chief and Michael Flynn for national security adviser – have been in the former category. At first glance Gabbard, who is from Hawaii and is the first Hindu member of the US Congress, seems an unlikely counsellor. She resigned from the Democratic National Committee to back Vermont senator Sanders and formally nominated him for president at the party convention in July, crediting him with starting a “movement of love and compassion”, although by then Clinton’s victory was certain. But the Iraq war veteran has also expressed views that might appeal to Trump, criticising Obama, condemning interventionist wars in Iraq and Libya and taking a hard line on immigration. In 2014, she called for a rollback of the visa waiver programme for Britain and other European countries with what she called “Islamic extremist” populations. In October last year she tweeted: “Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and must be defeated. Obama won’t bomb them in Syria. Putin did. #neverforget911.” She was then among 47 Democrats who joined Republicans to pass a bill mandating a stronger screening process for refugees from Iraq and Syria coming to the US. Media reports have suggested that Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon is an admirer of Gabbard. Last week, when 169 Democrats signed a letter condemning Bannon’s appointment by Trump for encouraging white nationalism, she was not among them. Trump, the former host of The Apprentice, continues to throw out hints and teases about his cabinet picks reminiscent of a reality TV show. “We really had some great meetings, and you’ll be hearing about them soon,” he said on Sunday. His other meetings on Monday included talks with Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin, former Texas governor and Republican presidential rival Rick Perry, and executives and anchors from major TV networks.\\nKellyanne Conway, Trump’s former campaign manager and still a key aide, told Fox News that Perry is a possible contender to lead the defense or energy departments while Fallin is being considered to head the interior department. Meanwhile there was no sign of an end to the war of words between Trump and the hit Broadway show Hamilton. Actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Vice-President Aaron Burr in the award-winning musical, directly addressed Vice-President-elect Mike Pence after Friday’s performance, expressing fears that his administration would not protect America’s diversity. Trump used Twitter to demand an apology. But Dixon told CBS’s breakfast show This Morning that he was delivering the message on behalf of the producers, creators and the cast. “We recognise Hamilton is an inherently American story, it’s told by the definition of the American community,” he said.\\n“We are men and women of different colours, creeds and orientations and the resonant nature of the show throughout the world demands we make statements when there are important issues facing us as a community. We wanted to stand up and spread a message of love and unity considering the emotional outpouring since the election. “Conversation is not harassment and I was appreciative that Vice-President-elect Pence stood there and listened to what we had to say.” Dixon said Pence was welcome to come backstage to have conversations with the cast about their concerns. He added that the show’s creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who played Hamilton as a member of the original cast, was involved in writing the message.\\nAsked how he felt about Trump’s demand for an apology, Dixon said: “There is nothing to apologise for … We welcome Donald Trump at Hamilton because I think the power of our show and the way we tell it is undeniable.” Trump tweeted nine times over the weekend. Two tweets were about his transition plans; the other messages complained about Hamilton, a skit on Saturday Night Live, Democratic senator Harry Reid and his recently settled fraud case over Trump University. The billionaire businessman will spend Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Jason Miller, a spokesman for the transition team, said Trump would get together with family and take a brief break from transition planning, “hopefully eating some turkey”. Vice-President elect Mike Pence is travelling for the holiday to Mississippi, where his son, a marine who is training to be a pilot, is stationed.', 'Donald Trump shakes up campaign Donald Trump has hired Stephen Bannon of the conservative website Breitbart News as campaign CEO and promoted pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager in his latest campaign shakeup. The moves represent a demotion for the Republican nominee’s current campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who has presided over a period of polling declines since taking control in June. Yesterday, the Guardian looked at how Manafort got a strongman elected in Ukraine. Trump said his new hires were “big people”. “I’ve known both of them for a long time. They’re terrific people, they’re winners, they’re champs, and we need to win it.” Trump tweeted the changes did not represent a “pivot” in his approach; he also denied reports that he is being advised by ex-Fox News chief Roger Ailes. Donald Trump appoints Breitbart chief in shakeup that demotes Paul Manafort California wildfire forces evacuation of 80,000 An intense wildfire fanned by strong winds and 100F (37C) temperatures is tearing through rural communities outside Los Angeles, unleashing fire tornados and forcing the evacuation of more than 80,000 people. The so-called Blue Cut fire is 60 miles east of LA, and has already scorched 9,000 acres. “There is imminent threat to public safety, rail traffic and structures,” said California’s governor, Jerry Brown. He said an estimated 34,500 homes and 82,640 people were being affected by the evacuation warnings. Blue Cut fire scorches 9,000 acres and forces evacuation of 80,000 in California Trip to the bottom The largest migration on Earth is very rarely seen by human eyes, yet it happens every day. Billions of marine creatures ascend from as far as 2km below the surface of the water to the upper reaches of the ocean at night, only to then float back down once the sun rises. This huge movement of organisms – ranging from tiny cockatoo squids to microscopic crustaceans, shifting for food or favourable temperatures – was little known to science until relatively recently. “The deeper we go, the less we know,” said Nick Schizas, a marine biologist at the University of Puerto Rico. Oliver Milman takes a trip to Bermuda to ride to the bottom of the sea in a (very hot) submersible. The deep ocean: plunging to new depths to discover the largest migration on earth\\nBiles sweeps the floor, and a boxer claims corruption As the astonishing Simone Biles won her fourth Rio gold, on the floor exercises, incendiary claims of corruption were being levelled at Olympic boxing after Irish world champion Michael Conlan accused Aiba, the amateur sport’s governing body, of corruption “from the core right to the top” after losing in the bantamweight quarter-finals to the Russian Vladimir Nikitin. “They’re fucking cheats,” he shouted into the ringside microphone. And the father of US boxer Gary Antuanne Russell claimed the fix was in when he lost his fight to Uzbekistan’s Fazliddin Gaibnazarov. “He got robbed,” shouted his father, Gary Russell Sr. An unnamed official added his opinion: “As predicted, the corruption is alive and well and the decisions speak for themselves.” Meanwhile, Brazil knocked the US out of women’s beach volleyball and China bemoaned its disappointing medal tally while Britain celebrates its surprisingly robust haul. Here is our daily Rio briefing for Day 12. Olympic boxing corruption alive and well, says official as rows continue Putin ‘conflicted’ over Trump Last December, Russian president Vladimir Putin described Donald Trump as “a colourful and talented man”. In June, he said: “Mr Trump has declared that he’s ready for the full restoration of Russian-American relations. Is there anything bad there? We all welcome this, don’t you?” Despite reports of potential links between the two men, these are the only public comments Putin has made on Trump. So, is Putin hatching a cunning plan to put Trump in the White House? Shaun Walker in Moscow reports. Putin’s praise for Trump may mask ‘conflicted’ feelings, Kremlin watchers say Death penalty: a subject no one wants to touch in 2016 Neither presidential candidate is keen to address the topic, despite waning public support for it. Donald Trump has voiced support for capital punishment on at least two occasions; Hillary Clinton only talks about capital punishment when pressed, and then clumsily. Unlike most of her own party, Clinton supports execution in the case of terrorists. The best policy may be silence. “Why bring it up if it’s going to stir the pot, if you don’t have to?” says Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, professor of public policy at the University of Southern California. Politics and the death penalty: for Clinton and Trump, safest stance may be silence Ford to mass-produce driverless car The auto manufacturer has announced it will produce a fleet of driverless cars for ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, by 2021. Mark Fields, Ford’s president and chief executive, said the next decade would be “defined by automation of the automobile” and the switch to driverless travel would affect society as much as the introduction of the assembly line did a century ago. The company said its new cars would be fully automated. Ford to build ‘high volume’ of driverless cars for ride-sharing services Film director’s rape charge complicates hotly anticipated release Nate Parker, the director of the fall’s most anticipated film, the slavery drama The Birth of a Nation, may have clouded the release of his film by electing to discuss the circumstances in which he was tried for rape while at college in 1999. Parker granted two interviews with the Hollywood trade papers in which he described how he and Jean Celestin, a fellow student at Penn State University, were charged with raping a female student while she was unconscious. Parker was acquitted of the charges in 2001; Celestin was initially found guilty and later granted a new trial that was never held.

Fashion’s greatest pop hits – from Gaga’s meat dress to Grace Jones’s Armani suit', 'Nigel Farage is anticipating an invitation to Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th president of the United States, sources have indicated, as it was confirmed the interim Ukip leader is poised to launch an eighth bid to become an MP. While the UK government plans to invite the president-elect to meet the Queen at Windsor Castle, the outgoing Ukip leader hopes to fly to Washington to see Trump being sworn-in on 20 January. His presence at the event would, Ukip sources said, be further evidence of Farage’s close relationship with Trump, who earlier this month defeated Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election.\\nIt would also further irk No 10, which has rejected Farage’s offers to act as a go-between with the Tump administration. Farage and his Ukip colleagues were the first British political figures to meet Trump following his election after supporting the billionaire during his campaign. Asked if Farage expected to attend the inauguration, a source close to the MEP said: “Trump’s personal loyalty is such that, whether No 10 like it or not, the relationship between Trump and Farage is unlikely to wither on the vine.”\\nThe inauguration, which marks the formal transition of power from Barack Obama to Trump, will take place on a stage on the steps of the US Capitol building. Up to 1m tickets are sent out for the event that are colour-coded to denote how close guests will be to the stage: blue, yellow, orange, purple or silver. Obama will be expected to attend the ceremony before being escorted from the White House by Trump and his wife Melania. The event is likely to be held amid demonstrations over sexist and racist comments made by Trump during his controversial and often inconsistent election campaign. Trump’s transition team has rewarded loyalists with posts in the new administration, rather than trying to unite the Republican party or appoint people based on their experience or qualifications. Farage and fellow Brexiters Arron Banks, Andy Wigmore and Raheem Kassam pulled off a PR coup by flying to Washington last Saturday to be photographed with the president-elect in front of his gold and diamond-encrusted elevator. May’s attempts to woo Trump have so far reportedly fallen flat. The president-elect left civil servants befuddled during a 10 minute phonecall with the prime minister by extending an unusual and un-presidential invitation to May.\\nDowning Street refused to deny a leaked transcript revealing that Trump told May: “If you travel to the US you should let me know.” Rather than a formal reassurance from both parties of the “special relationship” between the US and the UK, the leaders’ first dialogue has been compared to a casual invitation to a friend, rather than a state visit. The government plans to invite Trump for a state visit next summer, which will allow the prime minister to steal a march on Farage, Whitehall sources said. Meanwhile, Farage’s office confirmed he would stand for parliament again if the South Thanet election was re-held, going back on a previous pledge to retire from frontline politics. Police are investigating whether the Conservatives broke spending rules in the Kent seat at the last general election, when the party successfully fought off a challenge by Farage. The probe could lead to the result being declared void. A spokesman for Farage said he was “happy to confirm” that in the event of a byelection in South Thanet he would stand again.', 'Donald Trump, the Kool-Aid Man given human form, is America’s next president despite his historically abysmal approval rating prior to taking the oath of office. That must hurt his feelings, though you might assume he doesn’t have any, since he spends most of his waking hours tweeting insults at people beneath him on the social pecking order — all while wearing a suit multiple sizes too big for his ample frame. Well, you’re wrong: Orange Hillbilly Jesus has feelings! He has so many feelings, as you will discover if you watch OBJECTified: Donald Trump, a new special presented by OBJECTionable TMZ founder Harvey Levin, which aired on Fox News Channel Friday night. He has so many feelings that you might even forget that he’s an unrepentant demagogue and crypto-fascist pig. If you haven’t tired of the fawning puff pieces, the stream of photo galleries of Melania’s dresses and the pundits pretending that an anti-semite being White House chief of staff is normal, I highly recommend seeking out this program. Levin does a remarkable job acquiescing to the idea that Donald Trump is actually not the Gollum David Duke has been molding out of clay for the last decade and has finally figured out how to breathe life into, but a real person with his own ideas about America. Trump’s sober as a church mouse because his brother Frank died of alcoholism. This is legitimately, unmistakably sad and not open for mockery. But I also must admit the irony of the fact that I’ve been drinking way more since Trump was elected. The Donald can claim he’s doing us a service denouncing alcoholism, but my liver begs to differ. Trump is also a doting, overbearing father, which we discover from photos of his kids posing with their dad on red carpets and sitting still for staged photos of them answering fake phone calls and typing fake emails. Just like in the sitcoms we love! You know, Kevin Can Wait, Man With a Plan, and whatever else is on CBS right now at this very moment. In between the shock-and-awe moments of hagiography, Levin (who I should point out has made a career of tarnishing the reputations of celebrities and is now gleefully propping up Herr Trump as though he’s the dad from Full House) takes us through an MTV Cribs-esque tour of president-elect Trump’s office, telling the story of his life through the various trinkets and baubles he’s collected in his 70 years on this planet. Is there a more American concept than some inveterate psychic leech pretending like he’s making keen observations about a world leader through the shit he’s purchased or collected through a lifetime of unrepentant pirate conquest? There are school yearbooks, family photos, gold-plated bullshit as far as the eye can see, and the chair from the Apprentice. Our next commander-in-chief brags about his record in military school, which Levin doesn’t question for a second, despite numerous conflicting reports as to his conduct. This is the guy who helped bring down Ray Rice and now he’s tossing softballs to a leader who advocated for a national registry of Muslims. Trump proudly displays a letter from disgraced former president Richard Nixon from 1987 declaring his appearance on the tabloid talk show Donahue as evidence that he would make a fine public servant. There are numerous photos of Trump with black people — Samuel L Jackson, Oprah, even Spike Lee — to prove he’s not as racist as he seems. Oh, there’s Trump singing Take Me Out to the Ballgame at a Cubs game. That the Cubs and Trump both defied hundreds of years of orthodoxy and good taste to win big in 2016 is no coincidence. We are treated to multiple photos of our next president enjoying the company of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady — maybe the only man in this country with less public respect than Donald Trump. “I think Tom is totally innocent. I think Tom is, first of all, he’s such an honorable guy and I’m with him all the way,” Trump says of Brady. If this chief executive thing doesn’t work out, he might find himself in the chair opposite Stephen A Smith on ESPN’s First Take. I would enjoy Trump’s poisonous schtick far more if it was directed towards the question of whether or not the Miami Dolphins’ Ryan Tannehill is an elite quarterback rather than whether or not women should be given the right to choose. This is where we are as a nation, and I cannot think of a better man to usher us into oblivion than Harvey Levin. He has made a fortune taking advantage of the prurient interests of a clinically depressed country and now he’s humanizing a politician who made his name questioning the legitimacy of the sitting president, then labeling Mexican immigrants as rapists. Levin doesn’t seem bothered by his role in giving agency to a public figure who has gone on record advocating for famous people not waiting for consent from women. Ambition knows no boundaries. Ego is limitless in our new reality. To his credit, Levin asks Trump about why he maintains a table full of magazines featuring his cartoonishly tan face on the cover in his office. Trump responds: “It’s not ego. I love doing it. I just have fun.” What’s truly fun about this? What pleasure does he derive from his obsession with collecting his press clippings, even if they’re overwhelmingly negative? When he was booed walking to his polling place, did he get an illicit thrill from the anger? He claims in this show that he doesn’t subscribe to the notion that all press is good press, so how must he feel when more than half the nation thinks he’s reprehensible? The only reasonable response I have to this idea is that he must truly believe he is some messianic martyr who must suffer for our sins of government assistance programs, equality, freedom of the press, and social justice. “I’ve won enough for myself. I wanna win for the country. I hate, Harvey, what’s happening to our country,” he tells Levin in a moment of faux transparency. Even in these staged scenes of humanity, Trump cannot help but fall back on his tired campaign slogans. He wants to win for us this time! What a magnanimous fellow. I can’t win for myself, I guess. Watching this nonsense, I feel as though I’m an audience to a Tony Robbins-esque motivational speech. Believe in yourself as much as I believe in you, he might say. The only one holding you back is the man staring you down in the mirror. Trump simultaneously reinforces our latent inferiority complex, while also propping up our fragile self-esteem like a classic abusive husband. “I always tell people never, ever give up. Never quit. Always do something you love. You’ll have so much more success if you keep going. Even against odds,” he says when Levin asks him about his empire. Trump could have walked away when the media chattering class assumed his campaign was as moribund as Bernie from the film Weekend at Bernie’s — a movie that was popular in the last decade where anyone thought Donald Trump wasn’t a total scumbag. He stuck with it. He kept hustling, like the carney that he really is. No con can truly be abandoned. The illusion is paramount. That Donald Trump never drops the facade, even in the context of a program like this, is a testament to his commitment to the fraud. Over the credits for this farcical show, Levin lobbies for more time with our future leader. He just needs 45 minutes to wrap up, but Trump has a date with a person who will do even more to legitimize his rise to power: Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon. “Are you friendly with him at all?” Trump asks. “I don’t really know him,” Levin responds. Harvey might have good reason to not know Fallon, since his wealth is built on exposing the dark side of celebrities like him. The thing is, what Donald Trump values more than anything is access, social standing, and who you know. That Levin is not tagging along to the Tonight Show with Trump is anathema. The White House is now the Playboy Club — a den of iniquity for the rich, the famous, and the connected. If you voted for Donald Trump and thought he was one of you, you have four years to regret your decision.', 'Americans trying to unpick the phenomenon of Donald Trump have turned to a late left-leaning academic, who predicted that old industrialized democracies were heading into a Weimar-like period in which populist movements could overturn constitutional governments. In 1998, the late Stanford philosopher Richard Rorty published a small volume, Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America, that described a fracturing of the leftwing coalition that rendered the movement so dispirited and cynical that it invited its own collapse.\\nIn the days after Trump’s electoral college victory over Hillary Clinton, passages from Rorty’s book went viral, shared thousands of times on social media. Rorty’s theories were then echoed by the New Yorker editor David Remnick in an interview with Barack Obama and essay on his presidency, and taken up across the internet as an explanation for Trump’s success. In the book, Rorty predicted that what he called the left would come to give “cultural politics preference over real politics”. This movement would contribute to a tidal wave of resentment, he wrote, that would ricochet back as the kind of rancor that the left had tried to eradicate. Rorty suggested that so long as “the proles can be distracted from their own despair by media-created pseudo-events, including the brief and bloody war, the super-rich will have little to fear”. But as democratic institutions began to fail, workers would begin to realize that governments were “not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or jobs from being exported”, Rorty wrote. They would also realize that the middle classes – themselves desperately afraid of being downsized – would not come to their rescue. “At that point,” Rorty wrote, “something will crack.”\\n“The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for – someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots.” Rorty said “nobody can predict” what such a strongman would do in office, but painted a bleak picture for minorities and liberal causes. “One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past forty years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out,” he wrote. “Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion.” Intolerance and “sadism” would “come flooding back”, he continued. “All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet.” Rorty, a hero of the old left, hoped his peers would abandon what he perceived as anti-Americanism and return to a more pure-hearted, pragmatic view of liberalism. But he did not hold out much hope. Ultimately, he wrote, the so-called strongman would be powerless to do anything but “worsen economic conditions” and “quickly make his peace with the international superrich”.\\nTrump appears to have already fulfilled this prediction, filling his transition team with lobbyists, including for the oil, telecoms and food industries. He has named a Republican loyalist to be his chief of staff, and a far-right nationalist – himself a former Goldman Sachs executive – as his “chief strategist”.\\nRorty was not the first or last academic to predict the tectonic shifts of politics caused by technology, globalization and liberal movements. His ideas about voters turning away from the world, against “elites” and scapegoated minorities, were echoed by the historian Samuel Huntington in 2004 and by Noam Chomsky in 2010. In 1994, the historian Edward Luttwak noted “the completely unprecedented personal economic insecurity of working people”. Writing in the London Review of Books that year, he saw opportunity for “a product-improved fascist party” that would dedicate itself to “broad masses of (mainly) white-collar working people”. This year, however, Luttwak wrote a May op-ed in the Wall Street Journal urging calm at prospect of a Trump presidency, which he said would not be as extreme as his rhetoric.', 'Donald Trump has renewed his fight with the American media, criticizing the New York Times, ducking reporters to visit a restaurant and turning to Twitter as a means of direct communication. The US president-elect even appeared to allude to his reality TV show The Apprentice as he denied reports that his transition process is in turmoil and plagued by infighting. Trump waged an unprecedented one-man war against the media during his election campaign, banning some organisations from his rallies and regularly inciting his supporters to boo and jeer reporters. He used Twitter, on which he has more than 15 million followers, to berate his critics and throw out often incendiary statements.\\nNot even his elevated status as president-elect appears to have changed his habits. Whereas Barack Obama gave his first press conference three days after his election in 2008, Trump is yet to do so, instead giving a primetime TV interview and unleashing a barrage of tweets, yet again taking the US presidency into uncharted waters. “Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,” he posted on Twitter late on Tuesday. “I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!” His reference to “the finalists” seemed to deliberately evoke The Apprentice, in which contestants battled each other for a chance to work at his business and he told those who fell short: “You’re fired!” The Twitter storm resumed early on Wednesday morning when he denied media reports that his three adult children – Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka – would be receiving security clearances, raising potential conflicts of interest. “I am not trying to get ‘top level security clearance’ for my children. This was a typically false news story.” And then he singled out the New York Times, which during the campaign revealed how he may have avoided paying taxes for 18 years and which endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. This week the paper has reported on disarray in the transition and said that, while the presidents of Egypt and Israel got through to Trump quickly by phone, UK prime minister Theresa May had to wait 24 hours.\\n“The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition,” Trump tweeted. “It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.” He added: “I have recieved [sic] and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.” His decision to mention Russia first will not have escaped critics of Trump’s apparent admiration for president Vladimir Putin. The New York Times pointed out that it had reported that Trump had taken calls from the leaders of Egypt, Israel, Russia and Britain, but said they had been “conducted haphazardly” and without the state department guidance that is typical for such conversations. Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip style was met with criticism. David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush, tweeted: “It will never stop being insane that the president-elect of the United States foams at his critics on Twitter.” It is fine to publish a list of foreign leaders who called to congratulate him, Frum added: “But to toss names out there in a Twitter rage to answer a perceived media slight?! When does President Trump compromise an important secret?” Further concerns were raised about Trump’s handling of the media when he broke with protocol on Tuesday night, going out to dinner at a steakhouse after his transition team had told journalists he would not be out in public the rest of the day. Trump reportedly received a standing ovation and cheers on arriving at 21 Club in midtown Manhattan.\\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association said it was “unacceptable” that Trump was traveling without a regular pool of journalists to inform the public of his whereabouts. A protective pool of journalists is supposed to join the president or president-elect’s motorcade to record their whereabouts and be on hand in the event of breaking news. The Trump team has said it plans to respect the traditions of press access at the White House. Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents Association, insisted: “The time to act on that promise is now. Pool reporters are in place in New York to cover the president-elect as he assembles his new administration. It is critical that they be allowed to do their jobs.” On Wednesday, Jason Miller, a spokesperson for Trump, admitted that there was room for improvement. “Last night probably was an example where there could have been a little bit better communication,” he told reporters. “But again, our goal going forward is to get you guys the best information in a timely fashion. “But I would also say – would also stand up for the president-elect and say that, for some in the media, unless they’re actually sitting at the table, seeing if he’s getting the chicken or the fish, that they will never be happy. And there always needs to be some kind of balance for respecting some degree of privacy. But to your initial point, we do think that there will be improved communication and our goal is to make sure that something like last night doesn’t happen again.” Asked when the billionaire businessman would do a press conference, Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, replied: “Shortly, I would say. Some time soon. But obviously he’s meeting with – talking to heads of state and possible members of his cabinet and senior team, filling out his senior leadership team. A lot of activity going on upstairs.”\\nOn a conference call with reporters Wednesday night, Miller and RNC strategist Sean Spicer announced that landing teams would be deployed in the coming days to start the transition process and noted that all of those joining landing teams would sign a pledge to not serve as a lobbyist at the federal and state level for the next five years. They also noted several of the meetings that the president-elect had held with potential cabinet members on Wednesday, including senator Jeff Sessions, general Mike Flynn, representative Tom Price, representativeMike Pompeo and charter school leader Eva Moskowitz. They added that Trump is expected to meet Thursday with governor Nikki Haley, governor Rick Scott and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, among others. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich said the media would have to adapt to Trump’s “hands-on CEO” style. “It probably confuses the traditional political press because they apply traditional standards and you can’t do that with Trump,” he told Fox News. Gingrich added that he was “100%” sure he did not want a cabinet post as transition talks continued at Trump Tower, where the tycoon’s second wife, Marla Maples, was spotted on Tuesday afternoon.\\nThe departure of former US representative Mike Rogers as a national security adviser followed the removal of New Jersey governor Chris Christie as head of Trump’s transition team in favour of Vice-President-elect Mike Pence, who did not sign a memorandum of understanding with Barack Obama’s White House until Tuesday night. The appointment of Steve Bannon, a media executive accused of far-right ties, and the role of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner have fuelled discontent. On Wednesday Bernie Sanders, the leftwing Democrat who ran against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary, called the appointment of Bannon “totally unacceptable”. “In a democratic society we can disagree all we want over issues, but racism and bigotry cannot be part of any public policy,” Sanders aid. “The appointment of Mr Bannon by Mr Trump must be rescinded.” Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani appears to be haggling for the prize job of secretary of state. But the transition team is reviewing Giuliani’s paid consulting work for foreign governments including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, the Associated Press reported. He is also under scrutiny over speeches he made on behalf of the Mujahideen-e Khalq, a fringe Iranian dissident group. The group, which operates in exile, was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US state department in 1997 for its long and bloody history, including its involvement in the killing of Americans in Iran in the 1970s. Speaking fees paid by several MEK front groups to Giuliani and other politicians potentially broke laws on Americans receiving money from designated terrorist organisations. Another visitor to Trump Tower on Wednesday was current New York mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. He said he wanted to give Trump a feel of concerns everyone is feeling about his presidency. “I talked to him about concerns of potential deportations, I gave him the perspective of the NYPD [New York police department],” De Blasio said, describing New York “the ultimate city of immigrants.” There are more than 900 Muslim members of the NYPD, the mayor said, and citizens rely on their willingness to protect the city. “I let him know that so many New Yorkers were fearful and that more had to be done to show that this country can heal, that people be respected.” De Blasio added: “Even though I have very real differences with the president-elect, he is a New Yorker, I do think he loves this city.”', 'Two former Nato chiefs have called for an extraordinary summit soon after Donald Trump’s inauguration to reassure traditional allies that the US will still come to their defence. Former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen and his predecessor Jaap de Hoop Scheffer also warned the US president-elect against making a hasty deal with Vladimir Putin that would cede Crimea and eastern Ukraine as a Russian sphere of influence.\\nThey argue it would set a precedent for further expansionism in Russia’s “near-abroad”. “If we accept the annexation of Crimea we will have given up on the rule-based order and it would have consequences elsewhere in the world,” Rasmussen told reporters in a call organised by the Atlantic Council thinktank. During the election campaign, Trump said the people of Crimea appeared to want to live under Russian rule and said he would look at whether the US would recognise Moscow’s 2014 annexation of the peninsular. He also told the New York Times that allies would have to reimburse Washington for their protection or be told: “Congratulations, you will be defending yourself.” Scheffer raised fears that Trump would turn campaign rhetoric into administration policy in a grand bargain with Putin, ceding Crimea and eastern Ukraine to Moscow, in return for non-interference in the Baltic states. “In accepting the annexation of Crimea, it would be the first time since the second world war that borders have been changed by sheer force,” Scheffer said. “Such a deal would be considered by Russia and President Putin as a political alibi to expand his sphere of influence in what he qualifies as his ‘near abroad’. I think it would set a very bad precedent and might create in the Kremlin the wrong impression that if you wait long enough, Nato and the European Union and the Americans are finally giving in.” On his farewell tour of Europe, Barack Obama has offered reassurance to nervous allies that Trump is committed to Nato despite disparaging remarks about the pact. President Obama, who is meeting foreign allies in Berlin on Thursday, said “one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America’s commitment to maintaining a strong and robust Nato relationship, and a recognition that those alliances aren’t just good for Europe, they’re good for the United States, and they’re vital for the world.” However, the former Nato chiefs said that such reassurances would be more effective if they came from Trump himself. “I think it’s important to organise a Nato summit very soon after Mr Trump’s inauguration as the new American president,” Rasmussen said. He added that at such a summit the new president would reaffirm US commitment to defend all Nato allies, and those allies would promise to do more to honour existing pledges to spend 2% of their national income on defence. The alliance should also commit itself once more to supporting Ukraine independence and sovereignty. Scheffer said Trump appeared from his campaign to be a man “who does not like alliances”, adding that he should act fast to reverse that impression. “It is very important to come out for Nato as strongly as possible in the form of a summit,” Scheffer said, though both he and Rasmussen said such a meeting should be left until Trump appointees for top cabinet posts had been confirmed by the Senate. A lack of clarity, Rasmussen said, “could lead to miscalculation by potential aggressors”. “I’m concerned that President Putin might be emboldened already,” he added.', 'It was a touchstone of the Hillary Clinton campaign to paint Donald Trump as an alarming figure who was far from a positive role model for children. One campaign ad, called “role models”, which was viewed more than a million times on youtube, featured young children watching some of Trump’s most controversial and profane comments - including calling Mexican immigrants rapists and mocking a reporter with disabilities - with impressionable expressions. In the wake of Trump’s victory, parents have tried to turn a divisive and bitter election into a learning curve – by getting their children to write positive letters to the president-elect and mailing them to Trump Tower. A Facebook group called “Dear President Trump: Letters from Kids About Kindness” was set up the day after the election by Molly Spence Sahebjami. Sahebjami’s idea was for children to write letters to Trump “about the importance of being kind to other people, even if they’re different than you are”. The mother, a resident of Seattle, where voters overwhelmingly supported Clinton, said she knew many others who disapproved of Trump’s caustic language in the course of the campaign. She told the Washington Post that she decided to set up the group after her son, who goes to kindergarten, expressed concern about things Trump had said about Muslims because the family were of Iranian descent. “[Children] don’t know anything about the issues, like manufacturing jobs,” Sahebjami said. “But they know – at least where I live, it’s really prevalent [for kids] to say, ‘Oh, he’s the mean one’.” She added: “So I said to [my son], ‘Well maybe we should write a letter to him and we can show him. Why don’t you talk to him about why it’s important to be kind?’” Her son’s letter read: “Dear President-elect Trump, please be a good president. Be kind to all people. Some people in my family are a special religion and they are not bad guys.” While the Facebook group is closed to prevent negative comments, members can add other members, and more than 10,000 people have now joined. They have been encouraged to take pictures of their children’s letters and share them on social media using the hashtag #kidsletterstotrump. “DEAR MR TRUMP Be kind please FROM A Littel Boy TOMMY,” read one letter. Another, from a 13-year-old girl, stated: “Dear Donald Trump. Congratulations! To be honest you were not my first pick. I just wanted to tell you that I didn’t like the way you campaigned. You made women (including myself) feel bad, you discouraged people who weren’t like you. However, I am going to put those feelings aside and I hope that you will prove me wrong.”\\nAn episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live last week also opened with a comedic segment where children were asked about their thoughts on Trump. “We’ve heard from pundits, surrogates, experts and anchors, but we haven’t yet heard from kids. So, this afternoon we went out on the street just outside our theatre to ask children to give us their thoughts on our next president,” Kimmel said.\\nThis week, a new social media craze, called the #TrumpsComingChallenge, saw videos posted online by high school students who film each other yelling “Trump’s coming!” before everyone runs away screaming.', 'Japan, one of the US’s closest allies, allowed itself a cautious sigh of relief after its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described Donald Trump as someone in whom he had “great confidence” after they met in New York on Thursday. Abe, the first foreign leader to meet the president-elect, said he had come away from their 90-minute meeting confident that he could trust Trump, despite the property billionaire’s campaign criticism of Japan’s contribution to bilateral security ties.\\nA Japanese government spokesman said Abe’s relationship with Trump had got off to an “extremely good start”. Photographs released by the Japanese government showed that the president-elect’s daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and retired general Michael Flynn, touted as his national security adviser, also attended the meeting. White House press pool reporters and photographers covering the president-elect were not allowed into the meeting or to take photographs. The Guardian and other media are choosing not to use the Japanese government photographs since they were not taken by the independent media outlets that would normally be expected to record such events. While neither side revealed details of the discussions, Abe told reporters at Trump Tower in Manhattan: “We were able to have a very candid talk over a substantial amount of time, and in a very warm atmosphere. “I will not go into details or specifics about today’s discussions with president-elect Trump, but I do believe that without confidence between the two nations, our alliance would never function in the future.” Abe thanked Trump for meeting him while he was shaping his cabinet ahead of his inauguration as US president. “Despite his extremely busy schedule, because of decisions to be made vis-a-vis appointments or other related business, he was kind enough to receive me,” he said. “I renewed my conviction that together with Mr Trump I will be able to establish a relationship of trust. “As an outcome of today’s discussions, I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence.” During his presidential campaign, Trump set alarm bells ringing in Japan and South Korea after suggesting those countries – Washington’s closest allies in the Asia-Pacific – were not paying enough towards their own security. Trump hinted that the US could disengage militarily from the increasingly tense Asia-Pacific region by pulling tens of thousands of troops out of Japan and South Korea. He has, though, denied saying he would be comfortable with Seoul and Tokyo developing their own nuclear deterrents to counter threats from China and North Korea. Abe’s upbeat assessment of Thursday’s meeting will have reassured officials in Japan, although he refused to say if he had secured specific promises from Trump on Japan’s security. “I conveyed my basic views on various issues to Mr. Trump, but with regard to more of the specifics or details, because [he] has not assumed the office as the president of the United States and today’s discussion was an unofficial discussion, I’d like to refrain from touching on details,” Abe said, adding that they had agreed to meet again to discuss bilateral issues in more detail. Their meeting will almost certainly have touched on another area of concern for Japan: Trump’s election promise to rip up what he has called a “disastrous” regional free trade agreement. Abe did not comment on speculation that he had used his time with Trump to try to persuade him to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation free trade pact, excluding China, that would fall apart without US participation. Abe has pushed Japan to support the deal in the face of strong opposition from the domestic farming lobby, but Trump, whose “America first” protectionist message resonated with many voters, has given no indication he is reconsidering his vow to pull out of the deal as soon as he takes office on 20 January. Ahead of the meeting Japanese newspaper editorials had voiced concern over Trump’s stance on TPP, which already appears dead in the water after the Obama administration conceded it would not ratify it before the White House transition. The Asahi Shimbun said: “The global economy has fallen into low growth and is plagued by international economic friction. The world economy could plunge into a real slump if Trump’s actions, remarks and policy were to further instigate anti-globalism following Britain’s decision to walk out of the European Union.” Even before Abe arrived in New York, Chinese media poured cold water on the meeting, describing it as a last-ditch effort by a terrified Japan to elicit security guarantees from Trump.\\nThe Communist party-controlled Global Times, which sometimes reflects government views, claimed that Abe was in a “panic” over Trump’s unexpected victory last week, and now had “no choice but to curry favour with him”. Trump’s victory had come as such a shock to Abe that his advisers “hastily went out to build contacts with the Trump team”, the newspaper said in an editorial on Friday. Japan would be the biggest loser if Trump pushes ahead with his campaign pledges to pull troops out of Asia, the nationalist Chinese tabloid added. To avoid this, “Tokyo is prepared to humble itself if necessary”. The editorial continued: “After the Trump-Abe meeting in New York, Japan may publicise the results and show off to the world how firm the US-Japan alliance is. “But the divergence over Asia-Pacific policies between the US and Japan, or even the different opinions between Abe and Trump, will never be papered over.”', 'It has been a week since Donald Trump won the majority of electoral college votes and became president-elect of the US (and a week since he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton). It has been a week of endless questions and limited answers – how? why? And, perhaps most important of all: what now? More specifically, some have wondered whether Donald Trump would have been defeated if he had faced a different Democratic candidate: Bernie Sanders. On Wednesday, CNN journalist Wolf Blitzer asked Jane Sanders, wife of the former candidate for the Democratic nomination, if her husband would have had a better chance of beating Trump than Clinton. “Absolutely,” she replied, “but it doesn’t matter now.” There’s mixed evidence for that certainty. In the primaries, Sanders gained more votes than Clinton in Wisconsin and Michigan. Those are important states. Wisconsin, a formerly Democratic state, was narrowly won by Trump in the presidential election on Tuesday. In Michigan, the race was even closer, with Trump winning by just 11,837 votes (which represents 0.25% of all votes cast there). If Clinton had won just 109,000 more votes in those states (plus Pennsylvania where she also narrowly lost), we would be calling her, and not Trump, president-elect. But that is a big “if” for a number of reasons. Perhaps Sanders would have won Wisconsin and Michigan but lost Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota and New Hampshire – states that were only narrowly won by the Democratic party in the presidential election. It’s true that Sanders won all of those states except Nevada in the primary season but there’s a much larger caveat here: voting behavior in the primaries is different to voting behavior in the presidential election.\\nIf we can’t rely on primary vote counts to gauge Sanders chances, we’re not left with much else besides polling – a deeply flawed analytical tool. Nevertheless, it’s understandable why one of those polls is now being widely circulated. It found that in a race between Sanders and Trump, Sanders would have won with 56% of the vote. The national poll, which spoke to 1,600 registered voters two days before the general election was conducted by Gravis Marketing. Even more than most polls, that one is deeply flawed because it asks individuals to consider an alternate reality where Sanders was a nominee. Considering completely hypothetical and consequence-free choices encourages some unrealistic answers in surveys – otherwise 27% of US adults would waterboard someone suspected of terrorism. Slightly better then is polling which regularly asks a far less hypothetical question: “Do you have a favorable opinion of candidate X?”. The answers to that question are crucial in understanding why 2016 was no ordinary election year: Clinton and Trump were two of the most unpopular candidates US voters have ever been told to choose between. That dislike seemed to endure right up to the end of election season.\\nThe story for Bernie Sanders though looks very different (the strength of that feeling might explain why, in Vermont, Sanders’ home state and one he has served as Senator since 2007, 18,183 voters decided to write his name into their ballot as their presidential choice):\\nMore accurate perhaps is polling that asks about broader attitudes rather than people (if we had more such polling in the lead up to the election, perhaps the campaigns would have been more focused on policies). One such attitude seems important in this election: trust in government is at a historic low according to research by Pew Research Center and 81% of likely voters said that federal government was corrupt according to a survey by Rasmussen Reports in February. (It should be noted that trust in mass media is at a historic low too). Although Bernie Sanders has 34 years of political experience under his belt and Donald Trump has zero years, both candidates campaigned as outsiders and used anti-corruption rhetoric regularly in their speeches. That’s potentially important for votes because more Americans identify as Independent today than at any time in the last few decades. In 2015, Gallup found 42% of US adults said they were independent, compared to 29% who said they were Democrat and 26% who said they were Republican. There is one major drawback to all of these numbers though: they were collected before Donald Trump won a US presidential election – in the face of even the most trusted predictions. Everything is different now, and if Sanders were to test the numbers by competing against Trump in 2020, he will probably be doing so in a very different set of circumstances. • This article was amended on 16 November 2016. An earlier version said Sanders had won several named states in the primary season except Colorado. He won those states except Nevada. In addition, the question put to Jane Sanders by Wolf Blitzer was clarified.', 'In March 2016, Donald Trump gave a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). He was forthright about his support for Israel should he become president. He was particularly strong on Iran, and on the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by Obama, saying straight off: “My No 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran”. But dismantling the deal with Iran will not be so easy. In addition to Iran and the US, there are four other signatories – the UK, France, China and Russia, all of whom are convinced that the deal is important and valuable. Even Saudi Arabia seems recently to have come round to the idea that it’s better to have the deal than to lose it. If Trump acts against the deal (or even if he just sits back and allows Republican hawks to enact new sanctions legislation) it is to be expected that the Iranians will walk away from it and revert to their previous policy: enriching uranium that could someday be used to create a nuclear weapon. That would be bad for Israel and everyone else, and would also make Trump look bad. Some missed it at the time, but there was another strand to Trump’s Aipac speech – a hint of something else. He said the deal was bad – “… and we got absolutely nothing in return”. A little later he said that at the very least, he would enforce the deal “to hold Iran totally accountable”. It has to be the working assumption, for now, that a Trump presidency is worse for the prospects of the nuclear deal than a Clinton presidency would have been. But it may not necessarily turn out that way. Trump has suggested that he might work with the Russians to destroy Islamic State in Syria, which would in effect mean working with Iran too. In the Aipac speech and repeatedly elsewhere, he has stressed his self-image as a dealmaker, and also his desire to put America first, and (one of his strongest campaign messages overall) to correct allegedly unbalanced international trade arrangements that disadvantage the US. Might he seek a new deal with Iran, with a major trade element, in return for not tampering with the nuclear agreement? Trump would present such a deal as creating new jobs and benefiting US industries. It would give the US the benefit from the nuclear deal that Trump claims Obama failed to secure, putting Trump ahead of Obama on his own ground by positive action. The idea fits well with a whole range of Trump’s declared priorities, and if successful, would make him look good.\\nTo make this happen, or indeed to come up with any Iran policy with any chance of success, Trump will need good foreign policy advice. It’s not easy to see where that might come from. One candidate spoken of as a possible secretary of state under Trump has been John Bolton, whose favoured policy toward Iran has been to bomb the country. Others mentioned have been Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani. All three of these candidates have something in common: they have spoken in support of the MKO, an exile opposition group (also referred to with an alphabet soup of other acronyms – MEK, PMOI, NCRI, etc). The MKO pays public figures to support them against the Iranian regime. The MKO is a bizarre organisation. As it is today, it resembles a kind of religious cult, brainwashing its adherents, taking their money and property, and separating them from partners and families. It was removed from the state department’s list of terrorist organisations in 2012, but prior to that perpetrated bombings and assassinations within Iran. It originated in the 1960s as a violent Marxist-Islamic group opposed to the Shah; in the 1970s, it killed US servicemen in Iran, among others. It gave significant armed support to the revolution in 1979, but lost out to Khomeini’s supporters in a bloody power struggle thereafter, was forced into exile, and later was based in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Because it fought on Saddam’s side against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war, it has since then been completely discredited with ordinary Iranians in Iran. No one with any claim to sound judgment, let alone high office, should have given the MKO their backing.\\nAnother possibility in the air for secretary of state is Bob Corker, Republican senator and chairman of the Senate committee on foreign relations – strongly conservative, but an altogether safer choice. The coincidence of Trump’s election and Leonard Cohen’s death prompted me (and not only me) to recall lyrics from Cohen’s song The Future: “Things are gonna slide – slide in all directions … ” It’s important for the Middle East as a whole that, with so much else on the slide, the Iran nuclear deal is not.', 'Donald Trump will retain America’s commitment to the Nato alliance, Barack Obama has said, seeking to reassure a jittery world of continued American leadership. The Republican was often critical of Nato during the presidential election campaign, branding it “obsolete” while praising the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, a source of alarm in foreign capitals. But speaking in the White House before heading to Europe on his final foreign trip as president on Tuesday, Obama said Trump indicated when they met last week that he would not pull out of the decades-old alliance. “There is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world,” he said. “That will continue. In my conversation with the president-elect he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships and so, one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to Nato and the transatlantic alliance. Obama added: “I think that’s one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage during this trip is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America’s commitment to maintaining a strong and robust Nato relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren’t just good for Europe, they’re good for the United States, and they’re vital for the world.” The president touched down in Athens, Greece, on Tuesday morning on the first stop of his week-long trip, which will also take in Germany and Peru. He will meet more than a dozen foreign leaders seeking reassurance about what a Trump presidency means for global security.\\nIn a uniquely rancorous election, Trump lost the popular vote but won in the electoral college, sparking protests in major cities and fears from rights groups that he will unleash forces of sexism, racism and homophobia. His appointment of Steve Bannon of the rightwing website Breitbart News as chief strategist did nothing to quell their concerns. Obama, his legacy suddenly at risk, suggested that the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate agreement would be harder to unravel than the Republican’s campaign rhetoric implied. He has also advised Trump that gestures matter and he should start building bridges now in a divided nation. “I did say to him that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns that it’s really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign. And I think that’s something that he will want to do but this is all happening real fast.”\\nHe declined to comment on Bannon’s appointment for the sake of smooth transition. “The people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next president, the 45th president of the United States, and it will be up to him to set up a team that will serve him well and reflect his policies. Those who didn’t vote for him have to recognise that that’s how democracy works, that’s how the system operates.” Obama was a fierce critic of Trump during the campaign, accusing him of offering slogans, exploiting fear and being “unfit” and “woefully unprepared” for the job. He mockingly asked how a man who had his Twitter account taken away by his aides could be trusted with the nuclear codes. He warned that tolerance was on the ballot. Yet last week, he had to welcome Trump to the White House, determined to oversee a peaceful and orderly transition. “We had a very cordial conversation,” he recalled. “That didn’t surprise me to some degree because he’s obviously a gregarious person, I think he likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate. “What’s clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive and I said so to him. To the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, that connection he was able to make with his supporters, that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that’s powerful stuff. “I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer hard and set policy prescriptions than another president might be arriving with. I don’t think he is ideological. I think ultimately he is pragmatic in that way and that can serve him well as long as he has good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction. “Do I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course I’ve got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues.”\\nThe president said he believed Trump would come to realise the reality and gravity of the presidency. “I think the learning curve always continues,” he said. “This is a remarkable job. It is like no other job on earth and it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues. That is truer now than it’s ever been … Regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up.” Obama warned that there were “certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well, unless he recognizes them and corrects” them. Many regard Trump as the living repudiation of everything Obama stands for, but the president sought to find elements of consolation. The outgoing commander-in-chief said: “Campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognises that. I think he’s sincere in wanting to be a successful president and moving this country forward and I don’t think any president ever comes in saying to themself, ‘I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country’. “I think he’s gonna try as best as he can to make sure he delivers, not just for the people who voted for him but the people at large.” Obama also admitted that Democrats need to engage in “some reflection” about the way forward after last week’s shattering defeat which left Republicans in control of the White House, House and Senate. “I believe that we have better ideas, but I also believe that good ideas don’t matter if people don’t hear them,” he said. “We have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere.”', 'I was marching up New York’s Fifth Avenue on Saturday afternoon behind a woman carrying a sign that read: “Keep your tiny hands off my pussy.” We were heading towards a looming tower with tinted windows where the president-elect lives and I thought to myself: this is absurd. We should not think of any of this as “normal”. Nor should we consider it normal that one of the president-elect’s team appeared to hint that the Senate minority leader might face legal consequences for saying Donald Trump has emboldened bigotry; nor that they’ve refused to rule out jailing Hillary Clinton; nor that he plans to “immediately” deport three million immigrants; nor that he’s hired a documented racist, Islamophobic, antisemitic demagogue to help him run the White House; nor that he’s taken to Twitter to spread lies about the New York Times for reporting on him. So let’s not. Let’s not accept any of this as a new normal. Let’s resist normalization at every step – in our minds, our words and our actions. We begin by giving hell to anyone who tries to normalize the racist, misogynist, xenophobic bully who will soon be president. In the primaries, it was disgusting when Republicans like Chris Christie endorsed him, folding his racism and hatred into normal Republican political discourse. News media normalized him when they let him phone into their shows and asked him softball questions. Entertainment media normalized him when NBC invited him him to host SNL and had Jimmy Fallon mess up his hair. Now, it’s not just Republicans doing this: Oprah Winfrey, lobbyists, unions, businesses, traditional media companies, social media companies and many Democrats seem to want to act like Trump can be folded into normal business.\\nEven President Obama, who just a week ago said Trump shouldn’t have the nuclear codes, is trying to normalize his successor. Reject this. Anyone doing this is telling us to look past massive bigotry, Islamophobia, antisemitism and a culture of sexual predation. These people are not our friends. Resist their urge to make you complicit in your name. We must look closely at people who have claimed to be our political friends under false allegiances. As a gay man, I must take a hard look at the fact that Apple CEO Tim Cook, who hosted a fundraiser for Paul Ryan, and Peter Thiel, who destroyed Gawker in his war against a free press and who backed Trump, are now the two most powerful gay men in America. I have long been critical of “Gay Inc”, but it will now more actively be tied into systems of oppression against transgender people, Hispanics, Muslims, immigrants, Jews, black people and women. Gay rights will now likely fold into white male rights. These people are not our friends. Each of us also must know our own values, and what you are and are not willing to do in the name of normalization. Will you be silent if only rich women can access abortion (or no women can access it)? If the poor lose health coverage? If millions of Hispanic people are surveilled and their families broken apart? What about if water and air standards vanish and lead to the kind of catastrophe faced by the people of Flint? If Giuliani’s aggressive 1990’s New York stop-and-frisk policy is unleashed on the whole nation? Will you speak up? What laws will you break and not break? If you’re white and/or a citizen, will you risk going to jail to stop the violent deportation of a neighbor? You have to take stock of these questions, and answer them for yourself, because the people who will tell you to be obedient and to not question authority are not our friends. We have seen what Trump and his ilk think of an American-born Hispanic judge, a free press and the Voting Rights Act. He has threatened to sue the New York Times and his political opponents. If the justice department is run by Giuliani, which is a possibility, it is unlikely that he will be too eager to investigate the reported rise in hate crimes in the past week. So have no faith in the coming government and no faith in any media which cozies up to this man’s administration for access. Don’t assume you’ll be able to rely on social media to disseminate information as you have. Resist and accept that the world, and how it operates, is going to be fundamentally different.\\nFinally, we must let go of the normalizing idea that we are going “to get through this”. Many of us are not. If Trump has his way, some women (likely women of color) who can’t afford safe abortions will die having illegal ones. Black Americans, who will likely be more policed, will risk being killed more often by cops. If Obamacare – or Medicare, which Paul Ryan wants to make private – is rolled back considerably, many will likely die without proper healthcare. All of this will disproportionately harm people of color. Not all of us are going to get out of this alive or unharmed. But we can resist, fight for each other, witness one another and love one another. It’s going to take a more radical notion of love than we commonly hold – the kind of radical love Martin Luther King was jailed and died for expressing – and it will require never accepting that any of this is normal.', 'There was a widespread belief that once Donald Trump was president, his mode of communication would change. He would think first, speak later. And if he could not bring himself to do that, his wiser aides (or his son-in-law) would ensure that whatever device he used for his quickfire utterances was safely locked up. Like most forecasts about Trump, this was wrong. Whereas George W Bush – probably the first US politician to reach the presidency in the mobile phone age – was told in no uncertain terms to give it up, and his email habit, too, Trump has either not been so advised, or has treated the warnings with the same disdain he treats so much else. He has carried on with his tweets and gaffes, and in doing so he has earned almost universal disapproval from the political and especially the diplomatic establishments, which regard such heedless commentary as, first, ill-advised in the extreme and, second, plain crass.\\nIt is certainly risky. Trump is not a private individual now, if he ever was, and the words of a president have in the past been assumed to carry weight, even if they sometimes used language only the cognoscenti would understand. But is saying what you mean and meaning what you say really such a bad thing? Might there be merit to communicating unmediated, not just with your domestic public but with the world?\\nThe Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, – no mean user of social media herself – may have been flippant when she rejected Theresa May’s offer to be a “bridge” between the EU and the new US president, saying :“I don’t think there is a necessity for a bridge. We communicate with the Americans on Twitter.” But she was not wrong. It could be argued that in this age of instant communication, when everyone is free to “like” something or not, most politicians have missed a trick. Their reluctance to venture very far into the Twittersphere, other than for routine diary items, may have saved them and their countries needless trouble. But has it left them perhaps more detached from the real world than is wise? Diplomacy itself might benefit from more straight talking. The harsh words Trump and the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, exchanged during their first, curtailed, phone call, could well have pre-empted misunderstanding further down the line. Time, if not temper, was saved. The UK sometimes takes a perverse pride in being known as “perfidious Albion”, while Sir Henry Wotton’s famed quip about an ambassador being “an honest gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country” only reinforces the notion of diplomacy as a dark art. But what has this image achieved, other than to foster suspicion? Even today the British are renowned for their “drafting” skills. But this can come back to bite you. The UN security council resolution 1441 on Iraq may or may not have given the green light for war; its deliberate ambiguity is how it avoided a veto. But it precipitated a whole new dispute about the need for a “second resolution”. Why not have the disagreement first time around?\\nAnd already, despite all the criticism, it is possible to observe a Trump effect rubbing off on international discourse. We are hearing a new immediacy and outspokenness that used to be exclusive to the likes of Nigel Farage. The tropes of social media are suddenly apparent on the world stage, not least in the image of the Swedish deputy prime minister showing herself surrounded by seven female colleagues as she signed a climate bill. This apparently mocked the image of Trump surrounded by seven men as he signed the Mexico City policy on reproductive rights. Some of the EU discussion about Brexit has also been what would once have been termed only “free and frank”. The bill authorising the UK government to invoke article 50 is just 137 words long. But why waste words, on legislation or anything else? We may be witnessing the end of spin. If so, I will cheerfully deploy the new directness to say good riddance. Spin, and the degradation of language it entailed, is a large part of the reason people distrust politicians. They do not like politicians using words in ways ordinary people would not use them. Perhaps it takes the recklessness of Trump to yank language, politics and people back on to the same page, opening the way for a plain-speaking in public life that is less risky and rude than his is, but equally\\xa0direct.', 'In the end, it took less than 24 hours for Silicon Valley to start making nice with President-elect Donald Trump. For a full year, the tech industry had collectively railed against the xenophobic, bigoted, and anti-science tenor of candidate Trump, displaying a political consensus so strong that the only public outlier – PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel – became the target of a shunning campaign from industry insiders. Even the generally apolitical Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg rebuked Trump and his supporters’ “fearful voices talking about building walls”.\\nBut on Wednesday night Zuckerberg had a new message. “Feeling hopeful,” read the tag on a photograph Zuckerberg shared of himself and his infant daughter watching the election returns. In the caption, he wrote that “creat[ing] the world we want for our children” was “bigger than any presidency”. The accompanying emoji displayed wide, happy eyes and an eager grin. Zuckerberg was not alone in his change of tune. “We in the tech community are willing to work with President-Elect Trump to help those Americans who need it most,” tweeted venture capitalist and erstwhile Trump critic Chris Sacca. “The door is open.” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who said in October that Trump’s behavior “erodes democracy”, chimed in with a note of conciliation: “Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.” Perhaps Silicon Valley can do business with a businessman in the White House after all. Immigration, trade and regulation Trump made various statements during the campaign that suggested a Trump presidency would pose a direct threat at the tech industry. For an industry reliant on immigrant talent, his xenophobia was anathema. He called out Zuckerberg over the industry’s hiring of foreign workers on H-1B visas. He told Apple that it would have to build its products in the US, then called for a boycott when the company stood up to the FBI in its quest to force the company to unlock one of the San Bernardino shooters’ iPhones. He hinted that he might go after Amazon for its growing monopoly in online retail, telling Fox News that Bezos has “a huge antitrust problem”. He vehemently opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was supported by a large coalition of tech industry lobbying groups, who wrote in a letter to congressional leaders that the trade deal would “keep borders open to the free flow of data, provide a strong and balanced intellectual property framework, prohibit data localization requirements and other barriers to digital trade, and protect trade secrets, among many other benefits”.\\nHe also displayed signs of a dismayingly poor understanding of how technology actually works, with bizarre debate comments on cyber warfare and his statement that the FBI “can’t review 650,000 emails in eight days”. (You can, with software.) Yet despite his antagonistic exchanges with the technology world, Trump has also put forward decidedly pro-business ideas that could be quite welcome in techno-libertarian Silicon Valley. Trump’s transition website states that “regulatory reform is cornerstone [sic] of the Trump administration” and promises a moratorium on new regulations, a review of old ones, and the cancellation of many executive orders. He has also promised to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%. What’s not to like for corporations? Rebecca Smith, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, suggested Trump should fulfill his “signature campaign promise” to assist working people by taking on “corporations passing risk away from themselves and onto the back of workers and illegally calling them self-employed or independent contractors” – a practice at the core of of successful gig economy companies like Uber and Handy. But that approach – which would involve serious regulatory action by the Department of Labor – does not seem likely from any Republican administration, Trump’s rhetoric notwithstanding.\\n“Under the Trump administration, the argument of contractor v employee falls more on the Uber side than it does under a Clinton administration,” said Tim Wilson, a venture capitalist with Artiman. Wilson anticipated both opportunity and potential danger under a Trump administration. Trump’s apparent eagerness to set off a trade war with China could be damaging to consumer electronics companies like Apple, which rely on China’s manufacturing infrastructure and workplace, as well as the global supply chain of minerals. “Apple can’t manufacture a phone overnight in the United States,” he said. “This is a dangerous game to play.” New tech opportunities? Still, other Trump promises might create new markets ripe for Silicon Valley’s favorite form of disruptive innovation, such as his plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, some of whom form the bulk of the country’s agricultural labor force. That might create opportunity for the “agtech” sector, Wilson said. “If they really are serious and farm labor gets threatened, then anything that automates labor is something that is going to uptrend,” he said. Clean energy technology may be a loser, though, Wilson said, given Trump’s enthusiasm for fracking, coal, and fossil fuels. “The value proposition of anyone trying to reduce carbon dioxide is going to be hurt,” he said.\\nEven if Trump ends up being good or at least tolerable, for the tech industry, many people who work in the industry are feeling less sanguine about the future. Catherine Bracy, a former director of Code for America and co-founder of the TechEquity Collective, questioned how people in the realm of “civic technology” could continue doing their work under Trump. “What does it mean to be building tools that make an authoritarian dictator government more efficient?” she asked. “How do you continue to do your work to make it easier for people to do their immigration paperwork when Trump is threatening to deport DREAMers [children of undocumented immigrants]?” ‘It means they don’t care about us’ Bracy expressed dismay at the new, conciliatory tone of tech industry leaders, as did Leslie Miley, the director of engineering at Slack. “Chris Sacca is striking a softer tone,” he said. “Well – you don’t have to worry about stop and frisk, you don’t have to worry about being deported, you don’t have to worry about being Muslim.” “They’re all white men who are saying that,” he added. “They have nothing to lose.” Miley, who is black, suggested that the Trump presidency might cause Silicon Valley to lose highly skilled workers – not only by stopping them from immigrating here, but by causing some to emigrate elsewhere.\\n“For myself, I am reconsidering what my role is in the United States,” he said. “I am exploring all of my options because I don’t like living in fear, and right now I am living in fear. Living in a country that I’m afraid of is not something I want to do. Maybe that feeling will subside, maybe it will change, but today, that’s how I feel.” Of course, in addition to highly skilled H-1B visa immigrants, the tech industry also relies on an industry of service sector workers, many of whom are immigrants as well. “My whole team is worried,” said Adriana Floros, a 35-year-old Mexican immigrant who works in the cafeteria at Intel. “[Trump] is going to make things horrible for all the Latinos. I’m a resident, but I’m worried that if something happens they will take it away.” Floros said said that she had overheard several Intel employees cheering the Trump victory at work. “They were really happy and I felt terrible,” she said, “because what it means for me is that they don’t care about us.”', '“I’m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words.” This is one of Trump’s many infamous lines that make him as quotable as Oscar Wilde - for polar opposite reasons. If only Wilde were still alive to encapsulate in one catty sentence a situation that has left the most loquacious among us dumbfounded. Just as Dolly Parton famously remarked how expensive it was to look that cheap, perhaps there’s an uncomfortable truth in this: it actually does take someone highly educated to pretend to be that stupid. Donald Trump used many rhetorical linguistic devices to tap into the raw emotions of potential voters - and it worked. In this election, every lexical rule got tossed, twisted and trumped. Here are some of the language mechanisms he used: Braggadocio Trump relied heavily on superlatives to ramp up an emotional response to his grandiose claims. Things weren’t big, they were “yuuuuuge”. He wasn’t just going to make things great again, they’d be “amazing”, “tremendous”, “the best”. He wasn’t just going to win. He was going to “win so much, you’re going to be sick and tired of winning”. It’s the aspirational language of the American dream that has, superlative by superlative, slowly transformed into a nightmare. Binaries The divisive “us and them” rhetoric was used to full hateful effect by Trump. Either you’re part of the crusading Judeo-Christian west, or part of terrorist, destructive Islam. Either you’re a “criminal alien” or a hard-working, hard-done-by American. You’re “legal” or “illegal”. That “us and them” rhetoric of the campaign trail seemed to be diluted by the time he called for unity in his victory speech, though. Hyperbole In addition to personal boasts, Trump was prone to exaggeration and dramatisation. “The whole world is blowing up,” Trump would claim when discussing one country, Syria. When introducing Reince Priebus in his victory speech, he was described him as a “superstar” three times in two sentences - a bold claim for a man few have heard of outside the Washington bubble. Euphemisms Trump could play something down, as well as up. His most infamous euphemism, of course, was “locker room talk” - a supposed justification for admitting to “grabbing women by the pussy” without their consent. Half-finished sentences\\nListen to Trump in this clip. “They’re trying to justify i ... can you believe i … I have the best wo ...” This stuttering, interrupted form of speech is a hallmark of his seemingly off-the-cuff delivery. It mimics natural conversation patterns. Feeling less scripted, it has been designed to appear authentic, trustworthy and passionate, rather than scrutinised and autocued by a hundred advisers. Grammatical maturity Presidential candidate language has declined in complexity, according to a common algorithm called the Flesch-Kincaid readability test. It crunches word choice and sentence structure then gives grade-level rankings. George Washington’s language reached graduate-degree levels. Abraham Lincoln’s was 11th-grade. And Trump’s? Right down to fourth grade. Was he really saying “bigly” like a fourth grader or “big league”? The answer seems to be both. Repetition Trump punctuates his speeches with repetition. It hammers the point home when the crowd is rambunctious and words risk getting lost. But it’s also a delaying tactic, giving him time to select his next choice of words. On his news nemesis: “That’s wrong. They were wrong. It’s The New York Times, they’re always wrong. They were wrong.” The repetition isn’t always at the end of the sentence; sometimes it’s brought to the beginning for emphasis, a technique called anaphora. “I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting.” Or even book-ending repetition in a sentence like this from his victory speech: “Tremendous potential. I’ve gotten to know our country so well — tremendous potential.” Verbs Their most commonly used verbs revealed much about the tone of their campaigns; Clinton’s included “hope”, “support” and “try”. Trump’s were full of mansplaining and more binaries: “tell”, “lose”, “win”, and “stop”. Sexist and racist language Trump pejoratives “bad hombres” and “nasty woman” have become so infamous that they’re already being parodied and reclaimed on merchandise. Nomenclature What people were called mattered more than ever in this election. What they weren’t called was even more significant: Michelle Obama’s refusal to even utter Trump’s name, while roasting him robustly, spoke volumes by declining him the dignity of an identity in her speech. Hillary’s tactic was to keep it on first name terms. Trump’s name became handy for punning purposes (“love trumps hate”) and also an aptronym, for being synonymous with a fart. Hillary’s tripartite Presidential initialism, HRC, moved her maiden name to her middle name. It’s the Rodham that said: I am my own woman, not just his wife. Unfortunately, it just wasn’t enough. Gary Nunn is a regular contributor to Mind your language @garynunn1', 'Donald Trump appears to have softened his stance on a range of sweeping campaign pledges, saying in his first interview since his election as US president that he might not repeal Obamacare and that prosecuting Hillary Clinton over confidential emails was not a priority. The president-elect, who had said he would “immediately repeal and replace” Obamacare after taking office, told the Wall Street Journal he might instead seek to reform the policy, keeping the ban on insurers denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. He said he would also look to retain the provision that allowed young adults to be insured on their parents’ policies, adding that he had been convinced of the virtues of the two points in his meeting with Barack Obama on Thursday. Trump and his family also filmed an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes to be broadcast on Sunday. The president-elect said he would amend, or repeal and replace Obamacare without any gaps in healthcare provision. “It will be just fine. It’s what I do. I do a good job and I know how to do this stuff,” he told Lesley Stahl. Having called Clinton a “nasty woman” and “crooked” during the campaign, Trump struck a conciliatory tone towards his former opponent in both interviews. The Wall Street Journal asked about campaign promises to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue criminal charges against his Democratic rival over her use of a private email server to conduct official business as secretary of state.\\n“It’s not something I’ve given a lot of thought, because I want to solve healthcare, jobs, border control, tax reform,” Trump said. The statement may anger the president-elect’s core supporters, many of whom chanted “lock her up, lock her up,” at campaign rallies. He told 60 Minutes the call in which Clinton conceded the election was “lovely”, adding: “It was a tough call for her, I can imagine ... She couldn’t have been nicer. She just said ‘congratulations Donald, well done’.” “She’s very strong and very smart,” he said, adding that Bill Clinton had also called. “He couldn’t have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he had ever seen,” Trump said of the former president. The Republican party’s shock victory has led to protests in some cities and on university campuses, and there have been allegations of racist and Islamophobic attacks. Trump told the Wall Street Journal he wanted to soothe the febrile public mood. “I want a country that loves each other,” he said . The best way to do this was by creating jobs.” Asked whether the tone of his campaign had gone too far, he said: “No. I won.” The vice president-elect, Mike Pence, will play a key role in his administration, serving as a liaison with Congress, Trump said. On Friday Trump put Pence in charge of his transition team, while his daughter, Ivanka, her husband, Jared Kushner, and his sons Eric and Donald Jr joined the executive committee. The PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Stephen Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News who directed Trump’s campaign, are also on the committee. On foreign policy, Trump described resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict as “the ultimate deal … As a dealmaker, I’d like to do … the deal that can’t be made. And do it for humanity’s sake,” he said. On Syria, he said his focus would be on fighting Islamic State rather than getting rid of the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad. “Russia is now totally aligned with Syria, and now you have Iran, which is becoming powerful, because of us, is aligned with Syria … Now we’re backing rebels against Syria, and we have no idea who these people are,” he said. He said had received a “beautiful” letter from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and would speak to him soon. Protesters across the US have been preparing for a weekend of demonstrations in response to Trump’s election, as other activists began work on plans to disrupt his inauguration in Washington early next year. Rowdy protests against Trump and a campaign that was widely criticised as divisive have spread to cities all over the country following his victory on Tuesday, leading to dozens of arrests and a complaint from Trump on Twitter about “professional protesters” in one of his first public remarks as president-elect. Early on Saturday morning a man was shot at a protest in Portland, Oregon, where police also reported that “burning projectiles” had been thrown at officers. Portland police announced 25 arrests and described the situation as a riot. More than 10,000 people have signed up to attend a march at midday on Saturday from New York’s Union Square to Trump Tower, the future president’s home and corporate headquarters. “Join us in the streets! Stop Trump and his bigoted agenda,” the organisers of the said in a Facebook post. The Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan said on their website they would be holding a “victory parade” in North Carolina next month. There have been reports of racist and other discriminatory attacks following the election. The Southern Poverty Law Center has logged more than 200 such incidents since Wednesday. Richard Cohen, the organisation’s president, told the New York Times: “I don’t think there’s any question that there’s been an increase.” In Europe, politicians expressed deep misgivings about the Republican’s victory and attacked Theresa May’s hopes that the result would lead to a good trade deal for Britain as delusional. Axel Schafer, a senior German politician, told the Times: “Even before Tuesday the chances were rather low, now the hope for this kind of deal seems delusional ... With a more inward-looking Trump administration, it is in United Kingdom’s own interest to seek close cooperation with their EU partners in this field.” Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said Trump needed to learn “what Europe is and how it works.” “I think we will waste two years before Mr Trump tours the world he does not know,” he said. Boris Johnson, the UK foreign secretary, described the EU’s reaction as “whinge-o-rama”. He said on Saturday he would not be attending an emergency European foreign ministers’ meeting to discuss the election result. A Foreign Office spokesman told the Press Association: “There is a regular foreign affairs council meeting on Monday where a range of issues can be discussed in the normal way. “We do not see the need for an additional meeting on Sunday because the US election timetable is long established. An act of democracy has taken place, there is a transition period and we will work with the current and future administrations to ensure the best outcomes for Britain.” The former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers struck a cautionary tone in an interview with the BBC’s World At One. “We’re getting back into a world which is quite dangerous,” he said, raising the prospect of the US going to war with Russia or China.', 'Despite a lack of political experience, business magnate Donald Trump swept to an improbable victory in the US presidential elections. It is clear that despite a series of controversies, his message resonated with a huge number of American voters in key states, and revealed deep anti-establishment anger and discontent.\\nWe spoke to six Trump voters about why they voted for the Republican candidate, and why they think he’ll make a good president. ‘I don’t want the Clinton legacy continued in the White House’ Trump is a self-made man. Regardless of getting a hefty loan from his father, he used that money to make a name and legacy for himself. I hope that Trump’s experience as a businessman will enable our country to operate more effectively when it comes to managing our money. I want to change America to serve the people instead of a political system that wants to serve itself. My life won’t change much, except I will have more hope that my government is trying to make our country strong instead of pandering to its own liberal interests. My main hope is that he will help balance our budget, and secondly that he will help our economy to remain strong.\\nI don’t want the Clinton legacy continued in the White House. We impeached one Clinton, and there is too much scandal that revolves around the other. Why would I want that legacy in my government? He may say controversial things, but at least he tells you what he thinks. I certainly disagree with anyone that has behaved in a racist or sexist way. However, I feel like I know where I stand with Trump. He says what he thinks, right or wrong, and I know what I’m dealing with. I’m so tired of the media and Democrats bellyaching about Trump getting voted in. It’s what the people wanted! It’s pretty sad when all you hear is gloom and doom on the news, which I thought was supposed to be a balanced representation of the two sides. Surprise! There is a whole other part to this country outside of your newsroom walls that actually thinks differently from the mostly liberal ideas that most news outlets put out there. We are middle America, we are the hardworking people who are holding this country together with our roots, and we are ready to have a country that keeps its cheque book in balance like we do with our private bank accounts. – Rachael, 34, Indiana, small business owner ‘He knows how to make deals, deals that will make America prosperous again’ I was a Democrat for 39 years, but my children and grandchildren need an America that is out of debt. All that Obama did was double the debt since he took office. I will feel a whole lot safer than I ever would with Hillary. The biggest question is to ask why he kept sending troops and flooding us with Syrian refugees that are not vetted for the proper amount of time with the possibility of terrorists mixing in and coming to our homeland? My great nephew is still asking that question as he did two tours in Afghanistan. He got out because he felt the president didn’t care about him or his comrades. We have the greatest veterans in the world; I am one of them. The last two presidents didn’t care about what happened to us. Obama created jobs, but minimum wage jobs. You can’t support a family on a minimum wage. Our manufacturing plants are gone, the coal industry is gone from my area and Hillary would just shut it down the rest of the way. Obamacare is a failure. Thank God I don’t have to use it. But there are families that need it and if they can’t afford it they get fined. That in itself is the mindset of a dictator. Hillary was going to expand it and make it available for illegals too. I believe Trump will be a good president because he knows how to make deals, deals that will make America prosperous again. We need to bring our nation together. I like the fact that all three branches are controlled by the same party, now we can get down to the business of straightening out our country, taking care of our people, our veterans, getting the economy moving again and repealing Obamacare. – Nate, 58, Pennsylvania, retired from the federal government\\n‘I want conservative laws’ I cried when I left the polling location because I don’t like Trump at all. I was deeply saddened to vote for him. His personality, his mannerisms and his inexperience repulse me. I wish there had been another conservative choice without simply throwing away my vote. I know if I travel outside of the US I will be deeply disliked because of him. However, he is only a four-year investment and I am trusting in the checks and balances of our country to prevent him and his poor-judgment from damaging the country too much. Hopefully Trump will not affect my daily life. I personally do not have a gun but I strongly support the right to bear arms recognising it as a right that ensures protection from government tyranny. I am also against abortions. Trump has the opportunity to elect a supreme court member, maybe even two or three members considering the current health and age of some justices. Justices serve for a lifetime and I do not want the justices to be liberal. I want conservative laws therefore conservative justices. I can deal with a somewhat low four years, but I couldn’t deal with a supreme court that swings liberal and I couldn’t deal with losing gun rights. I hope the years fly by and that he will do as little damage as possible. I am deeply saddened by these options and I am not proud of our president in the least. – Andrea, Florida ‘Trump is exactly what you get, with Hillary you can’t know what’s real’ I couldn’t decide who to vote for until the day before voting. It was one the hardest decisions I have ever made. I decided on Trump for one reason: no-fly zones. Hillary guaranteed full scale war with Syria on day one. I mean how do you expect to initiate a no-fly zone over a sovereign nation? That would then in turn guarantee a conflict with Russia, which will assuredly lead to war. I know Hillary would have been business as usual as we spiralled ever closer to a full-scale nuclear war with Russia. Four years is a long time but there is always impeachment, and the next election. It’s a risk but one the American people are willing to take. I’ve previously voted Al Gore, Bush, Obama, Obama, and now Trump. I hope for a sincere shake-up and a breath of fresh air. Trump is a slimy scumbag, who wears it like a badge of honour. But Trump is exactly what you get, Hillary is a phantom and you can’t know what’s real about her. Fainting in New York saying it was heat when it was a mild day, then saying it was pneumonia finally. Lying straight-faced about her emails. Countries may be laughing at us but it took some balls to elect Trump last night. I don’t think a single person who casted a vote for him felt good about it. I sure didn’t, but felt like there was no other choice. It was either Trump or guaranteed war. I think Trump knows he is under-qualified but I sincerely think he will fill his cabinet with people who perform their functions effectively. His legacy is banking on this and right now it isn’t secure because the whole world, even Americans, are laughing when they say Trump won. It’s sincerely hard to believe. I feel Hillary would have been business as usual, she would have had nothing but political favours. – Paul, Ohio, software engineer ‘Obama has put a wedge between the people of this country’ The first woman president should have integrity and that historic moment should not be tainted by someone like Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump might not have political experience but I truly believe he has the American people’s interest at heart. We need to bring jobs back to our country, make the economy stronger and hopefully unite all people. I feel Obama has put a wedge between the people of this country. We should be looked at as individual merits and not by the colour of our skin. Trump won’t take nonsense from anyone and he doesn’t have any special interest he has to make happy. He’s for the people! – Arlene, New Jersey ‘Under Trump the American dream is revived’ Trump understands and supports the American dream; no matter what you have now, if you work hard you can better yourself and positively shape your wealth and future. Clinton made it known that she would continue Obama’s agenda of redistribution. What dream is there in working to see your future gains chopped up by taxation and welfare? Under Clinton I would have just held out my hand and stopped dreaming. Under Trump the American Dream is revived! I may not like the Trump he shows his buddies in the locker room, I may not agree with his too-rich-to-care insolence or his private life with women, but I agree with his platform and passion. He gets things done and his drive is proven. He fails and he fails better. I voted for Trump to keep the minimum wage hike down, retain our constitutional gun rights, and keeping close to the constitution and immigration. I can now start planning my next boutique without the threat of a minimum wage hike. I can afford to get sick while I’m working 60 hours a week to get my business off the ground. The fear of the taxation-to-death threat will lessen. Trump is a businessman. He will pave the way for me to start dreaming again. Until this election I was independent. This election I declared myself Republican for the first time. My friends are mostly liberal Democrats. They say I’m the poorest Republican they know. I hope that the silent majority stops being bullied by the loud minority. Trump promises to rebuild our army and fight for our safety, I look to see terrorism defeated and the war on cops to end, a solid declaration of war on Isis and a halt to the preference of immigrants before citizens. I hope welfare will be scaled back and employment will once again become the preferred way to support oneself. I cried when I heard Trump won. There is once again hope for the American Dream! – Heather, 43, Kansas, small business owner *Some names have been changed.', 'Bernie Sanders has acknowledged that Donald Trump managed to become US president by tapping into the anti-establishment anger of “a declining middle class” but said he will continue to challenge him. As thousands of people crowded into streets in major cities to protest against Trump’s victory, Sanders, who defied expectations by running a close race against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, said he was prepared to work with the president-elect to help working families.\\nBut the self-styled “democratic socialist” said he would “vigorously oppose” the “sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies” that featured prominently in Trump’s campaign. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, reluctantly backed Clinton in her doomed bid for the presidency after a hard-fought Democratic campaign in which the two repeatedly clashed as he portrayed her as a member of a discredited elite. Many commentators attributed Sanders’s popularity, particularly among young people, to anger at the establishment after the financial crash of 2008.\\nIn his post-election statement Sanders noted that Trump also harnessed that resentment. The statement said: “Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media.” Sanders added: “People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids – all while the rich become very much richer.” It concluded: “To the degree that Mr Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. “To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.”\\nAs US voters and international leaders began to come to terms with a Republican White House led by the former reality television star, people opposed to Trump held peaceful rallies on Wednesday against the racism, sexism and xenophobia that they say the president-elect has made mainstream. Demonstrations were held in cities including New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia and Seattle. As night fell in midtown Manhattan, people took over Sixth Avenue and marched by Trump Tower, carrying signs that read “Not my president”, “She got more votes” and “Hands off my pussy”, a reference to a leaked recording where Trump bragged that he could sexually assault women because of his fame. A number of arrests were made. Protesters who had marched all the way from Union Square – some 35 blocks downtown – continued past Trump Tower, with a crowd congregating in front of the president-elect’s building. “Fuck your tower! Fuck your wall!” people chanted at Trump Tower’s brass-escutcheoned facade, as scores of NYPD officers manned barricades, behind which stood eight Department of Sanitation trucks filled with dirt.\\nThousands also took to the streets in Chicago, a Democratic city that overwhelmingly supported Clinton according to initial polls. Gathering for what activists called an “emergency Trump protest”, demonstrators virtually shut down the city during rush hour traffic as they shouted: “Trump is not my president.” Several larger demonstrations throughout the day were led by high school and college students, including a massive walkout at a high school in Berkeley, California. Protests also launched in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Oregon and other states in regions throughout the US. By evening on the west coast large rallies began to emerge in Seattle and Oakland, organised under the hashtag #NotMyPresident.\\nSanders’s reaction to Trump’s victory echoes many on the left who have been alarmed by Trump’s extremist statements, but share the apparent rage of his supporters against the elite. In Britain, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: “Trump’s election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isn’t working for most people. It is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority, both in the US and Britain.” He added: “This is a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened. And the public anger that has propelled Donald Trump to office has been reflected in political upheavals across the world.” The president-elect is due to meet Barack Obama at the Oval Office in Washington at 11am ET (4pm GMT) on Thursday, for discussions about a smooth transition of power.', 'Donald Trump shattered expectations on Tuesday with an election night victory that revealed deep anti-establishment anger among American voters and set the world on a journey into the political unknown. The Republican nominee has achieved one of the most improbable political victories in modern US history, despite a series of controversies that would easily have destroyed other candidacies, extreme policies that have drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle, a record of racist and sexist behaviour, and a lack of conventional political experience. After surprise early victories in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, it fell to the rust belt states of the industrial midwest to determine the result of his stunning upset. Wisconsin and Michigan, two states hit hard by a decline in manufacturing jobs and lost by Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, were led by Trump as the race headed for an early morning cliffhanger. At 2.30am, the Associated Press projected Trump had won Wisconsin and called the overall race for Trump, who passed the 270 electoral college votes he needed to secure the presidency.\\nShortly afterwards, Clinton called Trump to concede but did not make a public address. Trump left Trump Tower for the short journey to the Hilton Midtown, where the president-elect then took to the stage and insisted he would “deal fairly with everyone”. “Sorry to keep you waiting, complicated business, complicated business,” began Trump to raucous chants of “U-S-A, U-S-A” from his excited supporters. “I have just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us – it’s about us and our victory – and I congratulated her on a very hard-fought campaign. “Now it is time for Americans to bind the wounds of division,” he added. “It is time for us to become together as one united people … I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.” Earlier, the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, appeared before distraught supporters to announce that she would not be appearing to give a concession speech. “Everybody should head home,” he told them. “Get some sleep. We’ll have more to say tomorrow.\\n“It’s been a long night and a long campaign,” he added. “We can wait a little longer, can’t we? They are still counting votes and every vote counts, several states are too close to call so we are not going to have anything more to say tonight.” Clinton called Trump to concede around 2.30am, Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told New York Magazine. Conway said Trump told Clinton: “You’re a smart tough lady and you ran a great campaign. Thank you for calling. I respect you.” Trump also spoke with Barack Obama, who called to congratulate Trump early on Tuesday morning. The White House said the president called Clinton and “expressed admiration for the strong campaign she waged throughout the country”. . Obama is set to speak more about the results later on Wednesday and has invited the president-elect to the White House on Thursday. “This is a historic night,” said the vice-president-elect, Mike Pence, in the first official Republican response, introducing Trump. “The American people have spoken and the American people have elected their new champion.”\\nRepublicans have also secured majorities in the House of Representatives, the Senate and will probably get to reappoint a fifth Republican nominee to the supreme court – potentially leaving the new president with few checks and balances. Investors reeled from the prospect of a victory that would reverberate around the world and futures markets pointed to a fall of nearly 600 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As results started to come in, two candidates with very different views of America were watching television just two minutes’ walk from each other: the Clintons at the Peninsula Hotel in midtown Manhattan and the Republican team in Trump Tower. But the mood in the Trump camp shifted early after signs of a strong performance in Florida and Clinton supporters began contemplating the consequences of a result few thought was possible. At a “victory party” for Clinton supporters, under the veil of a glass ceiling that was meant to be an epic symbol of a historic night when gender barriers were swept aside, there was a bleak mood. Thousands of people who filled the Jacob Javits convention center in Midtown Manhattan – and the thousands more lining the blocks outside – had eyes glued to the TV. A woman clasped her hands over her mouth in disbelief as the newscasters announced Trump had won North Carolina. The mood dropped markedly as results began to roll in: Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, all for Trump. Outside the Javits Center at the so-called “block party”, a couple embraced. The woman wiped a tear from her face and the man stroked her hair. Another man, who identified himself only by his first name, Theo, called the results “scary and troubling”. “You don’t think there could be so much hate in this country – there is.” After Podesta spoke, a stream of stunned supporters, some in block-colored pantsuits, others toting tired children, many wiping tears from their eyes, exited the building that was meant to be a symbol of barriers broken. “What happened? What did we just do?” asked Gloria Lowell, the mother of an adopted son from Guatemala. Staffers hugged each other and wiped tears from their eyes. They had prepared for this outcome – but no one truly believed it. Susie Shannon travelled from California to be at the Javits Center on Tuesday night so that her eight-year-old daughter, Gracie, could say she was there when Hillary Clinton was elected president. They left the center in the early hours of Wednesday morning stunned. “We waited for hours to come here tonight,” she said in shock, holding her daughter’s hands. “I wish Clinton herself had come out and spoken to us. It would have been nice to hear from her.” Meanwhile, the crowd at Trump’s watch party in the Midtown Hilton grew increasingly excited as the evening went on. Loud cheers erupted every time that returns from Florida and Ohio were shown on the television screen. The mood grew increasingly optimistic as attendees huddled anxiously around their televisions clasping their drinks and their cellphones in equally tight grips. Many shouted “lock her up” when Clinton’s name was mentioned and berated members of the media for being slow to report election results. Meanwhile, in Oregon and California, demonstrators took to the streets to protest about Trump’s victory. Hundreds gathered in Oakland, Portland and Los Angeles overnight, but there were no immediate reports of arrests. Exit polling by CNN suggested 88% of voters had made up their minds more than than week ago, before last-minute FBI inquiries into Clinton’s emails temporarily raised fears of a late Trump surge.\\nWorld leaders offered messages of congratulations, with some offering more subdued support, to Trump on Wednesday morning. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who Trump repeatedly praised on the campaign trail, sent a telegram to congratulate the president-elect, the Kremlin said. Putin reportedly expressed “his hope to work together for removing Russian-American relations from their crisis state”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, did not publicly congratulate Trump, but offered the president-elect “close cooperation”. “Germany and America are connected by common values: democracy, freedom, respect for the law and for human dignity irrespective of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political conviction,” Merkel said. “On the basis of these values, I offer the future president of America, Donald Trump, a close working relationship.”', 'Privacy activists, human rights campaigners and former US security officials have expressed fears over the prospect of Donald Trump controlling the vast global US and UK surveillance network. They criticised Barack Obama’s administration for being too complacent after the 2013 revelations by the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, and making only modest concessions to privacy concerns rather than carrying out major legislative changes. The concern comes after Snowden dismissed fears for his safety if Trump, who called him “a spy who has caused great damage in the US”, was to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin to have him extradited. Snowden, in a video link-up from Moscow with a Netherlands-based tech company on Thursday, said it would be “crazy to dismiss” the prospect of Trump doing a deal but if personal safety was a major concern for him, he would not have leaked the top-secret documents in the first place. Snowden, wanted by the US on charges under the Espionage Act, found asylum in Russia in 2013 but his visa is due to expire in July. Privacy and human rights campaigners in the US and UK say a Trump presidency will tip the balance between surveillance and privacy decisively towards the former. The UK surveillance agency GCHQ is so tied up with America’s NSA, often doing work on its behalf, it could find itself facing a series of ethical dilemmas. On the campaign trail, Trump made an ambiguous remark about wishing he had access to surveillance powers. “I wish I had that power,” he said while talking about the hack of Democratic National Committee emails. “Man, that would be power.” Although Obama’s administration introduced a few modest concessions to the privacy lobby following Snowden’s revelations, he left the rest of the surveillance apparatus untouched. His approach has been to offer a modicum of transparency, much of it forced on him by the courts, in place of reform.\\nThe White House, which would not comment for this story, has no evident regrets about that approach. The administration believes it has set an appropriate balance between intelligence authorities and civil liberties, and expressed confidence in intelligence professionals who will continue to serve in the NSA and FBI under Trump to act responsibly. But others are less convinced. “There have been some people who were complacent about things like drone killing of US civilians and mass surveillance under Obama, because they trusted him. That wilful neglect on their part is about to come back and possibly bite all of us in the ass,” said Nick Merrill, the executive director of the Calyx Institute, a technology focused research group that promotes encryption tools. Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer who works for the American Civil Liberties Union, said: “The danger of the aggregation of executive power we have seen over the last decade is that we might have an executive who is not worthy of that trust. This has been a trend in the US but there has been a weakening of constitutional oversight during the growth of the national security state. “I think many Americans are waking up to the fact we have created a presidency that is too powerful.” John Napier Tye, a former state department official who became a reluctant whistleblower in 2014, warning of NSA dragnets, said: “Obama and Bush could have set the best possible privacy protections in place, but the trouble is, it’s all set by executive order, not statute. “So Trump could revise the executive order as he pleases. And since it’s all done in secret, unless you have someone willing to break the law to tell you that it happened, it’s not clear the public will ever learn it did. Consider that even now, the American people still do not know how much data on US persons the NSA actually collects.” Thomas Drake, an NSA whistleblower who predated Snowden, offered an equally bleak assessment. He said: “The electronic infrastructure is fully in place – and ex post facto legalised by Congress and executive orders – and ripe for further abuse under an autocratic, power-obsessed president. History is just not kind here. Trump leans quite autocratic. The temptations to use secret NSA surveillance powers, some still not fully revealed, will present themselves to him as sirens.” One specific surveillance measure Trump proposed on the campaign trail was surveilling mosques and keeping a database of Muslims. “A grave concern we have is that his rhetoric is going to be perceived in some corners as a green light for unfettered surveillance activities. Our concern is not just about the NSA but also the FBI. The FBI doesn’t exactly have a great record over the last 15 years,” said Farhana Khera, the president and executive director of the US-based civil rights group Muslim Advocates. The next flashpoint over the NSA’s powers will come late in 2017, when a major surveillance law permitting collection of Americans’ international communications is set for expiration, the legal basis for the NSA’s Prism programme which siphons information from the technology giants.\\nThe UK government has made even fewer concessions to privacy campaigners than the US. The UK parliament has passed the investigatory powers bill, due to receive royal assent shortly, that basically legalises the illegal activities exposed by Snowden. Even in Germany, where public support for Snowden is at its highest, parliament last month approved legislation that ostensibly increases oversight of intelligence agencies but which privacy campaigners claim expands their powers. Jim Killock, executive director of the UK-based Open Rights Group, said the NSA and GCHQ worked closely together. “Given that the agencies’ operations are nearly indistinguishable, it makes it incredibly hard for the UK to resist using our resources for risky endeavours or even human rights abuses … Trump’s election ought to remove the complacency MPs have been suffering from.” Carly Nyst, a UK-based human rights lawyer, said: “The British people should be especially worried: the NSA and GCHQ act so closely, and intelligence is shared so fulsomely, that any increase in surveillance under Trump will undeniably touch upon the privacy of Britons’ communications.” According to documents released by Snowden, now years out of date as technological advancements have developed, the NSA vacuums 5bn daily records just of cellphone locations. In April 2011, it was collecting an average of 194m text messages every day. Through its partnership with Britain’s GCHQ, it has access to, among other things, webcam imagery, including pornographic material. GCHQ collected such imagery from 1.8 million Yahoo users in a six-month period in 2008.', 'Winners Pharmaceuticals The chance of a clampdown on drug pricing, as promised by Hillary Clinton, has now disappeared, benefiting global pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. Infrastructure companies Trump promised to spend around $500bn to improve America’s transportation, water, telecommunications and electricity systems, which would benefit construction firms such as Caterpillar. Mining groups and steel companies The infrastructure spending plans should help mining companies and steel specialists, which would also benefit from any moves that boost US economic growth. Precious metal miners are in demand as investors buy gold and silver as havens for their cash amid the uncertainty. Coal Trump has promised to revitalise the US coal industry and has no qualms about global warming. Rail companies Rail will be boosted by Trump’s spending plans, and increase freight transportation. Technology businesses Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet have huge cash piles which they are more likely to repatriate back to the US to pay out as dividends or use to make acquisitions. At the moment, they would pay 39% tax but Trump has proposed a one-off charge of 10% for repatriated cash. Retailers and restaurants Trump’s plans to reduce individual and corporate tax bills could help lift the economy and boost consumer spending. Defence companies They will benefit if Trump either persuades Nato to increase defence spending or if he reduces US involvement in Europe and forces local governments to lift their own expenditure. Losers Renewable energy Remember “climate change as a Chinese fiction”? Trump has already said he would cancel the Paris agreement to cut emissions, leaving renewables companies out in the cold. The Mexican peso The prospect of a physical wall between the US and Mexico has already hit the country’s currency and other losers will be businesses with substantial earnings in the country, such as Tate & Lyle and the Spanish bank BBVA. Any renegotiation of trade deals is also likely to hit Mexico. US healthcare providers, hospitals and insurers Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – which would cause massive uncertainty in the sector and a probable fall in the number of people insured. Global freight companies If Trump puts up new barriers to trade and cancels existing deals, non-US transportation and logistics companies such as AP Moller-Maersk and Deutsche Post could be affected. Carmakers US carmakers who have factories in Mexico where labour costs are lower would lose out from Trump’s plans, while Japanese firms will be hit by the expected volatile currency fluctuations between the dollar and the yen. Telecoms and media The outlook is uncertain, especially for AT&T’s plan to buy Time Warner, which Trump has said he would block. Polling and gaming companies Once again pollsters called it wrong (see Brexit etc) while gaming companies were also caught unawares, with Paddy Power paying out on a Clinton victory three weeks early.', 'The UK’s hopes for a continuation of the much-vaunted special relationship with the US under Donald Trump have suffered an early setback after the new president-elect spoke to nine world leaders in the 24 hours after his election win, without Theresa May getting a call. Trump has thus far talked to the leaders of Ireland, Mexico, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, India, Japan, Australia and South Korea, according to various reports. A Downing Street spokesman said a phone call between May and Trump was “being arranged now”. He said: “They will speak at the earliest possible opportunity.” The spokesman added that May had sent the president-elect a letter.\\nMay’s letter, announced on Wednesday, offered her personal congratulations to the controversial and unexpected victor in the presidential election. In an earlier message the prime minister said she was confident of continued cooperation with the US with Trump in the White House. “I would like to congratulate Donald Trump on being elected the next president of the United States, following a hard-fought campaign,” May said, in a message containing none of the veiled criticism of his views expressed by Angela Merkel, among others. “Britain and the United States have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise. We are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence,” May said. “I look forward to working with president-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead.”\\nAccording to reports, the first leader Trump spoke to on the phone was the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Sisi congratulated him on the election victory, a spokesman for the Egyptian leader said. Ireland’s government said the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, had a 10-minute call with Trump, and was invited to visit the White House on St Patrick’s Day. Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has said he and Trump agreed in their call to meet before Trump takes office, while Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was invited to the White House.\\nOther leaders to have a chat with Trump so far include the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe – they reportedly talked for 20 minutes and agreed to meet soon in New York – and South Korea’s president, Park Geun-hye. Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was reported to have chatted with Trump about security and trade in their call. Nigel Farage, the interim Ukip leader and main British political cheerleader for Trump, had earlier predicted that the Republican’s election win would usher in a new era of close relations between the countries. Speaking on TalkRadio, Farage said: “However imperfect Donald Trump may be, and my goodness me he is, his mother was Scottish, he owns Turnberry, he spends a lot of time in our country, he loves our country, what we stand for and our culture. “And this is a big opportunity for all British business. Once we’ve left that awful EU thing, we can now do our first trade deal with the United States of America. Isn’t that great.”', 'Many Australians have watched Donald Trump run for US president with a mix of disbelief and horror. But among those who will be barracking for him on Wednesday are prominent Liberal politicians, who see in the orange one a kindred spirit. Cory Bernardi, for one, has been advertising his support for Trump on Twitter. On Monday he posted a picture of himself wearing a red cap with “Make Australia Great Again” emblazoned on it. On Halloween he posted a picture of two children dressed as The Donald and as Hillary Clinton, in striped prison fatigues.\\nIn between pumping up his current core concern – repealing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act – he has been retweeting Trump, and spreading his core messages about alleged Clinton corruption.\\nMeanwhile, his ideological bestie George Christensen has been talking Trump up as a change agent on Facebook. (He also seems to have a fondness for the Philippines’ trigger-happy president, Rodrigo Duterte, commenting, “Duterte’s alright. Enjoys 70%+ support in the Philippines.”) When he’s not ventilating his own obsessions with 18C, the Human Rights Commission, and sharia law, Christensen is also happy to sledge Clinton for the benefit of his battalion of pissed-off commenters. On Monday we got an insight into how deep Christensen’s Trump fandom has become, when the Labor MP Tim Watts held up a copy of Trump’s 2011 book Time to Get Tough which Christensen had left on his seat during a division. It ought to go without saying, but mustn’t, that influential Liberals making a spectacle of their support for Trump is disturbing.\\nEven if, like me, you’re deeply ambivalent about what a Clinton presidency will mean for the rest of the world, seeing Bernardi and Christensen stump for Trump offers more evidence of the disturbing direction Australia’s ruling Coalition has taken. It’s worth reminding ourselves of what they’re supporting. Trump is heartily supported by the most reactionary and racist elements in US politics, because his program – such as it is – is in large part an appeal to white nationalism. When he says that he will “Make America Great Again”, in truth, as the commentator Arun Gupta pointed out on Monday, he’s offering to make America white again. Gupta rightly goes on to argue that “Trumpism boils down to one idea: ethnic cleansing”. Removing “illegals” from central America and banning immigration from any Muslim country can only amount to a program of racial cleansing in a country with the ethnic diversity of the US. Trump’s swipes against Black Lives Matter and his raging about “voter fraud” are coded appeals to a sense among some of his supporters that African Americans should be returned to the margins of the country’s life. Australians like to look down on the spectacle and extremism of US politics but the fact is that our respective histories have strong parallels. Each was founded on forms of white nationalism, which bubble up in political life and everyday conversation. The white settlers of both countries dispossessed and slaughtered their native inhabitants. Later, each heavily restricted non-white migration, especially from Asia. White advantages (and white racism) have never disappeared in either country. But a more diverse migrant intake from the latter part of the 20th century has factored into complex politics of backlash and resentment. At first this was given expression by flash-in-the-pan demagogues in the 1990s, like One Nation here or David Duke in the US. Now, cynical conservatives have brought it into the heart of the political process in Australia, the US and other western democracies.\\nWhen we look at Bernardi and Christensen’s most prominent activities – halal food inquiries, 18C, or palling around with Reclaim Australia – we see that they too embrace a politics that centres around white identity, and portrays its privileges as being at risk from threatening ethnic and cultural others. Their Trump support is, no doubt, partly about trolling for attention. But we are best to take it at face value. The prime minister’s rumblings about putting the repeal of 18C back on the agenda show the influence they have in a precariously balanced political situation. And Australia’s own version of Trump’s wall – the refugee detention camps run by offshore clients – show how much damage has already been done. They also show that any complacency Australians may feel about their own political landscape vis-a-vis that of the US is completely misplaced.', 'The nightmare truly began when Donald Trump threw Jorge Ramos out of a press conference in August last year. Some might argue it was when he called Mexican immigrants “rapists” the month before, but the beast hadn’t yet emerged, hadn’t yet been given a clear face or features. “Go back to Univision!” Trump shouted as Ramos was escorted out of the room. The familiar syntax was not lost on us Latinos, who have been told to “go back” for as long as we’ve been in the United States, whether we were born here or not. Before he was forcibly removed, Ramos was criticizing Trump for effectively saying he would deport 11 million undocumented people and build a 1,900-mile border wall. Well, Trump skirted those specifics, but that was the reality of what he was proposing. We Latinos were put in a familiar place – where we are merely numbers or parasites to the economy, seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as laborers. Al mal tiempo, buena cara, goes an old Mexican proverb. “To the bad times, good face.” When I first delved into the world of activism, I used to hold the saying in contempt. It seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the Mexican American in the face of oppression, the immigrant family, the Chicano who doesn’t want to make a fuss. It painted us, I thought, as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to us. Watching the Trump campaign, being its first scapegoats, I felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure. The slogan Make America Great Again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country. We are the unclean other, our culture dilutes the purity of America’s white citizens who must be protected from us. Make America great again – by kicking us out. Violence against Latinos surged, at Trump rallies and across the country. Xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the demagogue’s rants, his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors. “Send them back” was a phrase I heard more in those months than I ever had in my life. “You have to go back” became a common response to everything I wrote. Something had changed. It was Trump’s attack on US district court judge Gonzalo P Curiel, born in Indiana and of Mexican descent, that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality. Trump, then the presumptive Republican nominee, accused Curiel, who was overseeing a class action lawsuit against Trump University, of being biased simply because of his Mexican heritage.\\nI remember watching the debacle unfold and thinking: “So this is how he’ll silence us as president.” All of us. For Trump, it has never been about immigration. It’s been about stoking racism against brown people, against black people, against the “other”. “He’s a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican,” Trump said of Curiel. “Which is all fine. But I say he’s got bias.” It harkened back to McCarthyism. This is what he meant when he said he would make America great again. Things took a dip into the absurd with the infamous Cinco de Mayo taco bowl tweet. Trump, smiling and without irony, as if he hadn’t advocated for the mass deportation of our people and hadn’t called us criminals and thugs, tweeted: “I love Hispanics!” It was beyond parody. Today, many hope that the long nightmare is about to draw to a close. But Trump could still pull off a win. And even if he doesn’t, the Trump machine will roll on, with or without him. We have on our hands a significant population of angry white citizens who blame us for all their frustrations. Things are about to get worse for us, not better. It happens in cycles. America’s last mass deportation of Latinos and Mexican Americans happened during the Great Depression. Approximately 2 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were rounded up and ejected from the country. And leading up to Trump, xenophobia in the Republican party was already the norm. Trump merely brought the subtext to the fore, bolded it and added several exclamation points. It’s a recipe for disaster. Al mal tiempo, buena cara. I used to hate the phrase, but now I think of it daily. It helps me survive the daily inanities of the election cycle, the daily ways we are dehumanized. It’s not putting on a smile and pretending the bad times aren’t happening. It is a radical act of survival. It is a resolute affirmation in the face of adversity: I will make it through this. I will live to see the better days.', 'Donald Trump lies like he tweets: erratically, at all hours, sometimes in malice and sometimes in self-contradiction, and sometimes without any apparent purpose at all. The Guardian has catalogued more than 100 falsehoods made by the Republican nominee over the last 150 days, and sorted them according to theme. Hillary Clinton has been caught in more than a dozen falsehoods of her own, for instance about her email practices and her past support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But Clinton often makes her falsehoods in dense legalese, making them hard to pin a motive on: many could as easily be errors as lies, careless exaggeration or deliberately misleading claims. Trump, on the other hand, will say “wrong” when he hears his own quotes. His own lawyers met him in pairs to counteract his lying, court documents show. He has invented false statistics, fictional videos and sex tapes and a nonexistent man named “John Miller” to talk about his sex life. Months of fact-checking, however, reveal methods and, whether he means to or not, Trump’s guide to success through lying.\\nDegrade and destroy For decades, Trump has described America and its leaders in apocalyptic terms. He thought Ronald Reagan weak and “a disaster”, he lambasted George HW Bush and Bill Clinton’s policies, and after supporting George W Bush’s Iraq invasion, quickly dismissed that war as “a mess”. In Trump’s world, crime is always rising (the national rate fell for decades), and African Americans are “living in hell” (they are not). Migrants are flooding in (more Mexicans are leaving than arriving), and they bring violence (there is no evidence that they do). Civilian and military leaders are always clueless (Trump received five deferments from Vietnam), except when they love him. We have no idea who refugees or undocumented migrants are, and they take our jobs (we know very well who they are; they include his wife). Trump’s vision of the US has been, for decades, one of dystopia – he even described the 1990s as a crisis worse than the Great Depression. But amid all this desolation Trump gains three things. He fuels doubt and fear, leaving people vulnerable; he denigrates his opposition en masse, blaming the world on them; and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage. Embiggen big league Like a man who once took a joke about the size of his hands too hard, Trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as possible, from his never-proven $10bn worth (Forbes estimates $3.7bn) to crowds at his rallies and his success in meaningless internet polls. This self-inflation is pierced throughout by paperwork. In March, the Guardian found that Trump valued a New York golf course at $50m in one document and at $1.4m in a court filing (he sued to pay lower taxes). On Thursday, the New York Times reported similarly huge discrepancies in his reported income. The Washington Post has shown repeatedly that Trump’s boasts of charitable giving have virtually nothing behind them. He has also falsely bragged of endorsements from federal agencies and claimed “many environmental awards”, and tried the ploy in reverse: he has called the millions his father gave him as “a small loan” and portrayed his $916m loss in 1995 as an example of “smart” tax avoidance. This sort of exaggeration is a common sales technique: overstate the value of a product to make it more attractive and assume it will be bargained downward. In February Trump confessed “everything’s negotiable” about his statements, then quickly said building a wall on the southern border was “not negotiable” – the equivalent of a liar saying: “Everything I say is false, but not that.” Shout at the messenger\\nWhenever in doubt, Trump attacks what he calls “the dishonest media”, accusing reporters (without evidence) of bias, inaccuracy and a failure to show the size of his rallies. He ignores that reporters quote him extensively, call his campaign for comment, interview his supporters, his rival’s campaign and independent voters and experts. He often cites news stories about Clinton, and even praised fact-checkers in a presidential debate for catching her in a falsehood. At every rally, Trump says the cameras refuse to show his audience, even though his campaign forces cameras to stay within a small pen, where they pan to show the crowd – as anyone at his rallies or watching online can see. Only one camera at each event stays fixed on Trump: the shared “pool” camera, whose footage networks share and which stays on Trump so as not to miss his speech. Last week, NBC’s Katy Tur, a target for criticism from the podium, noted that Trump “has joked in private with reporters about how he understands how the pool camera works”. “This is a shtick that he does to rile up his base,” she said, “to give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his favor, to give them an excuse to berate someone that’s not Donald Trump.” Trump’s scorched earth insults, like his attacks on other institutions, try to delegitimize authority and leave only himself in its place. But while most Americans still respect other institutions that Trump has demeaned, the press was vulnerable. Decades of cable news punditry had already diminished opinion of the press, and the internet has sapped major newspapers of their powers to compete with openly partisan sites, fake news and social media networks. Trump tried to fill the vacuum. Conspiracy smoke, fire not required Trump’s most famous false conspiracy, about Barack Obama’s birthplace and who started birtherism, is only one of many. There was Ted Cruz’s father and JFK’s assassin, drawn from a tabloid with ties to Trump; the climate change “hoax” that was “invented by the Chinese”; the Muslims who cheered September 11; the vaccines that cause autism; the Miss Universe “sex tape”; the political correctness of San Bernardino; the secret Muslim president and his secret terror agenda; and the antisemitism-tinged plot of bankers and the media. This category includes what the Toronto Star’s Daniel Dale calls “pointless” lies, the oddest of Trump’s falsehoods. These claims include an invented letter from the NFL about debates, the authorship of the poem The Snake, and that Frank Sinatra didn’t hate My Way his entire life. Trump himself seems to get lost in the intrigue, and sometimes slips into a Dadaist jumble of anti-Clinton allusions – Whitewater, cattle futures, Benghazi, uranium, Blumenthal, “bleaching” 33,000 emails – that sound sinister when put together. This is apparently the desired effect: a haze of noxious sentiment, even if no one has found fire for all that smoke. For more than 20 years, journalists and congressional Republicans have tried. The latter have spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating the Clintons’ associations and careless email practices but have yet to find criminal conduct. Arguably Trump’s worst conspiracy is his insistence that voter fraud has “rigged” the election, which merges his fringe claims with his attack on institutions. No evidence supports the claim of widespread fraud and the decentralized electoral college makes such a conspiracy functionally impossible – but the claim gives Trump something to blame failure on besides himself. Like his other conspiracies, it sows doubt and distrust, diminishing the nation so that Trump can portray himself as an authority. Trump’s favorite escape from this maze is the phrase “there’s something going on”, which lets Trump suggest malevolence, claim ignorance and say nothing of substance at all. Deny everything\\nWhen cornered by his own quotes or something he doesn’t know, Trump often lies with blunt denials – “wrong!” – or variations of the phrases “that’s very important” or “we’ll look into it”.\\nHe also tries to wriggle out of uncomfortable situations with this tactic, most notably when he claimed ignorance of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who has professed approval for his policies, and white supremacists. Trump had disavowed Duke a few days earlier and denounced him in 2000, but in February he refused to condemn like-minded supporters, saying: “I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists.” On the edge of pointless self-inflation and denial is Trump’s fixation with Vladimir Putin, whom he has claimed to know “very well”, to have spoken with “indirectly and directly”, and to have never met and “know nothing” about. Trump also falsely insists that Putin called him “a genius” (Putin called him “flamboyant”). Distortions Not all Trump’s falsehoods are exotic. Like Clinton and many career politicians, he sprinkles misleading statistics into speeches, including on the murder rate, African American unemployment, poverty among Hispanic Americans, the deficit and taxes. Trump also takes the tactic a step further, condensing whole arguments into outrageous soundbites. This is how a conservative argument about military presence in Iraq transformed into the claim that Obama “founded” Isis and how Clinton’s support for immigration reform became “open borders” . Clinton has similarly oversimplified arguments into claims, for instance linking Bush-era tax cuts to the financial crisis.', 'Donald Trump on Sunday warned darkly of the danger posed by Somali migrants in Minneapolis, a deeply segregated city that has the largest Somali-American community in the US.\\n“Here in Minnesota, you’ve seen first-hand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with very large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval,” the Republican nominee told a rally in the solidly Democratic state, two days before the presidential election. He then claimed: “Some of them [are] joining Isis and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world.” “Everybody’s reading about the disaster taking place in Minnesota,” he added, before claiming, falsely: “You don’t even have the right to talk about it.” Trump has made warnings about refugees a staple of his stump speech, though he has most commonly targeted Syrians fleeing the five-year civil war that has devastated their country.\\nThree Somali Americans, two US citizens and one a lawful resident, pleaded guilty in June to trying to join the terror group Islamic State, or Isis. Law enforcement officials have said that more than 30 young men from Minnesota have left the county to join Isis or al-Shabaab, which operates in east Africa. According to the 2010 census, more than 85,000 Somali Americans lived in the US with the largest concentration living in the Twin Cities. Despite integration campaigns by the community – a former refugee is poised to win office as a state lawmaker, for instance – the area remains one of the most racially segregated in the US. The Republican nominee has said he would bar refugees from settling in places without the approval of local governments. A federal court ruled against Trump’s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, in October, when he tried to block Syrian refugees from settling in his state. In that decision, judge Richard Posner said Pence’s actions were discriminatory, and “the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they’re black but because he’s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn’t discriminating”. In Minneapolis on Sunday, Trump said blocking refugees would be “the least [government] can do for you”. “You’ve suffered enough in Minnesota,” he said, “and we will pause admissions from terror-prone regions until a full security assessment has been performed and until a proven vetting mechanism has been established.”\\nThe US has some of the strictest vetting procedures in the world, requiring multiple stages of interviews with security agencies, background and health checks, and the process can last two years. Trump has not specified which countries he would bar migration from, nor many details of what he calls “extreme vetting”.\\nTrump argued that these methods would prevent terror attacks in the US, citing “the recent terrorist attack in St Cloud”. In that Minnesotan city, in September, a 20-year-old Somali American man stabbed eight people in a mall, before being fatally shot by a police officer. The next day, leaders of the Somali community condemned the attack and the FBI said it was investigating it as a “potential act of terror”. It released few details. “It’s horrible what they’re doing and if you want people to pour in Minnesota all you have to do is vote for Hillary Clinton,” Trump said on Sunday. Somali Americans have become a target for domestic terrorists. In September, three members of a militia group were arrested for allegedly plotting to bomb an apartment building in Garden City, Kansas, with a number of Somali-American residents and where one apartment was used as a mosque. The three men arrested could face life in prison. According to the FBI complaint filed against the suspects, the men called themselves “the Crusaders” and Muslims “cockroaches”, and said that they wanted to “wake people up” with “a bloodbath”. This article was amended on 7 November 2016 to clarify that Garden City, Kansas, was the location of the apartment building that was the target of an alleged bomb plot, not the location of the three members of a militia group arrested over the plot.', 'Donald Trump has been short on policy details during his campaign. But already, the president-elect has hinted at an agenda that is as ambitious as it is disturbing on key policy issues. Here’s what he will inherit and how he might respond, from the Guardian’s specialists. Immigration Trump will enter the White House riding a wave of xenophobia and fear driven in no small part by his plans to drastically overhaul America’s immigration system. The president-elect has pledged to implement many tenets of his controversial reform package from day one and will now be emboldened by a Republican majority in both houses of Congress. Meanwhile, countless immigrant communities across America will no doubt be terrified about just how far he might go.\\nTrump’s promise to build an “impenetrable physical wall” across the US southern border will supposedly commence on his first day in office. But the kicker to his now infamous campaign slogan – making “Mexico pay for it” – will prove a near impossible deal to broker as experts predict the cost of such a construction could be four times higher ($40bn) than Trump estimated during the campaign. Aside from the economics, the humanitarian consequences of increasing border security as hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants continue to flee violence at home and seek refuge in the US are near unfathomable. Trump’s administration has pledged to pursue a temporary ban on migration from regions he deems exporters of terrorism and where even his “extreme vetting” will not be sufficient. Although this policy has gone through many iterations, the legality of such a program will almost certainly be challenged in the courts by those who argue it will simply act as a smokescreen to allow discrimination against Muslims seeking to enter America. Nonetheless, Trump is likely to be buoyed by the assistance of Congress. For the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, Trump’s presidency will usher in an era of heightened uncertainty and paranoia, as the president-elect has pledged to ramp up deportations. Trump will triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and seek to create a “special deportation taskforce”. Although the president-elect has claimed this taskforce will first focus on “the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants”, Trump has made clear that any undocumented migrants could be affected. Up to 6.5 million people could be at risk of swift deportation. The key question for the new administration will be at what point, if any, can it satisfy the demands of its white, conservative base, whipped up by the rhetoric of the campaign. Oliver Laughland\\nNational security Trump now has control over the vast US security apparatus, with all its power to kill, surveil and influence. Trump, whose command of policy specifics is minimal, has made no secret of his inclination to unleash it. Now he faces early tests of how far he will go. Barack Obama will leave office with Guantánamo Bay still in operation as a detention facility. Trump’s election ensures the infamous wartime prison escapes closure, but it will probably cross a constitutional Rubicon. The president-elect has pledged to increase the Guantánamo population, a reversal of Obama’s approach, “with some bad dudes”. Among those “bad dudes”, Trump told the Miami Herald, could be American citizens. His pledge to bring back “worse than waterboarding” threatens to undo the shaky coalition against torture, especially in a GOP Congress, of the late Bush and Obama administrations. The move would be illegal if Trump meant to try Americans in military commissions, and almost sure to be found unconstitutional if Trump meant holding Americans in indefinite detention. In the same interview, Trump also signaled a departure from both Obama and George W Bush in expressing opposition to using the criminal justice system for terrorism cases. Since Trump’s definition of the domestic threat has centered on what he has called “radical Islamic terror”, US Muslim communities, already the target of widespread law-enforcement suspicion since 9/11, would probably find themselves subject to a separate system of wartime justice in which they would enjoy fewer rights. Trump has unapologetically embraced “profiling” as a “commonsense” approach to predicting terrorist threats, by which he means increasing police and intelligence scrutiny of Muslim communities. Trump has endorsed surveillance in mosques and even a database of American Muslims, incendiary proposals that threaten traditional American liberties. The response of the FBI’s leadership – which already has a strong base of support for Trump and a history of teaching its agents to consider Islam itself a danger – will be a pivotal test for justice in the Trump era. So will his choice of intelligence agency leaders, as Trump has attracted little support among experienced intelligence officials outside of the far-right fringe. Another immediate test Trump faces will be a military challenge. Obama will leave 8,400 US troops in Afghanistan. The fortunes of America’s longest war are on a downward trajectory as the Taliban reconquers lost terrain. Trump, who has criticized a withdrawal in Iraq he once supported as a gift to Islamic State, must now choose departure, failure or escalation. Spencer Ackerman\\nForeign policy Trump spent the campaign threatening to upend what has been called the liberal international order, the network of treaties and multilateral institutions that govern global relations. He has said he would tear up and renegotiate trade treaties, and has even called into question US commitment to the Nato alliance, the linchpin of western cohesion. With a completely new kind of leader preparing to enter the Oval Office, it is already looking like a world turned upside down. The long-negotiated multilateral trade deals the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe (TTIP) will be the first to be halted. Opposition to those accords was a cornerstone of the Trump campaign. Trump has also said he would take apart the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) that binds the US economically it to its neighbors, Canada and Mexico. In place of such treaties, he has said he would negotiate bilateral deals that would be more favorable for US manufacturing. But he would face hostile trading partners, irritated at the dumping of major agreements. Trump’s America could easily face a trade backlash and a downward economic spiral. The other consistent theme of the Trump campaign was a foreign policy that revolved around his personality. He would bring his self-vaunted skills as a businessman to cut bilateral deals with other world leaders, particularly the autocrats. Trump said he would even talk to Kim Jong-un if the North Korean dictator would travel to the US for the conversation. That is unlikely, but the prospect of an unconditional dialogue between leaders would throw a wild card into a deadlocked and extremely dangerous situation in which Pyongyang is well on the way to developing a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile, and a missile able to reach the west coast of the United States. The relationship that will define the Trump presidency, however, will be with Vladimir Putin. Each of them has showered the other with praise. At every turn in the campaign, Trump refused to criticize Russian expansionist foreign policy in Ukraine and Syria. His aides specifically removed language from the Republican party platform about sending lethal aid to Ukraine, and Trump himself has echoed Putin’s denials of Russian military presence in the country’s east. In Syria, he has characterised the Russian and Assad regime bombardment of the opposition as a war on Islamic extremism, again emulating Moscow’s line.\\nTrump’s twin policies on the Islamic State (Isis) were to “take their oil” and “bomb the shit out of them”. The first is impractical without a vast military occupation and the second is illegal if it was suggesting indiscriminate bombing. A dual offensive against Isis is under way aimed at its twin strongholds of Raqqa and Mosul led by US allies, and a President Trump would face serious resistance from the Pentagon if he wanted to put US boots on the ground or carry out joint operations with the Russians. Early on in a Trump presidency, expect a summit with Putin in which US-Russian relations will be reworked along lines the Russian leader has been pushing for, ceding Moscow areas of influence in the Middle East and on Russian borderlands. Such a discussion will shock major US allies in Nato, an alliance Trump has described as “obsolete”. He has questioned whether it would be worthwhile for the US to provide a security umbrella to allies who are not deemed to have contributed enough, in financial terms, to collective security. Turmoil within Nato could meanwhile tempt Putin to make encroachments on its eastern flank. Few are more worried about the global consequences of a Trump win than the residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Julian Borger\\nHealthcare The one constant in Trump’s scattershot health policy is his promise to immediately repeal Obamacare. Just last week, Trump said that if elected he would convene a special congressional session to destroy the 2009 healthcare reform. If he successfully repeals the law, which is unlikely, it would disproportionately affect low-income people, according to multiple analyses. The number of uninsured individuals would increase by 16m to 25m, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a research group. It would also increase the federal deficit, according to the same analysis, because the end of Obamacare means the end of taxes the health reform law brings in – adding about $33bn more to the deficit in the first year. There is also the question of what replaces Obamacare. The closest thing the Republicans have to a substitute is a blueprint created by the House speaker, Paul Ryan, who has a rocky relationship with the president-elect. For these reasons and more, it is unlikely Trump would get the congressional approval needed to actually repeal the law, though he and the Republican-dominated Congress could tear away at some of its key provisions. The rest of his health proposals are similarly chaotic. Trump’s seven-point plan for healthcare includes allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines (allowing for greater variation in insurance regulations), deduct health insurance premiums from their tax returns and use health savings accounts. He also aims to require price transparency from healthcare providers, allow more drugs to be imported from overseas and give block grants for Medicaid to states. And his plan would reduce access to abortion, contraception and preventative care. Trump’s ideas “bewilder” establishment GOP health experts such as Robert Laszewski, who told the New York Times in April that the proposals were “a jumbled hodgepodge of old Republican ideas, randomly selected, that don’t fit together”. Amanda Holpuch\\nWomen and gender rights Trump enters office with a lot of question marks hanging over his proposals on issues of gender. Will he support a childcare policy that doesn’t leave low-income families out in the cold? Would he continue to enforce the Obama administration’s executive actions on campus sexual assault? Would he preserve executive orders that protect transgender individuals from discrimination? Trump hasn’t answered these questions, but if he follows the lead of the rest of the Republican party, the answer is probably a big “no”. Throughout the election, on issues of major cultural significance, Trump has tacked further and further to the right. After starting his campaign by suggesting that he was open to funding Planned Parenthood, for instance, and that Roe v Wade was settled law, he has come to fully embrace the Republican party line. Supreme court justices? They should be pro-life. Planned Parenthood? He’ll defund it. Trump also opposes the use of Medicaid to cover abortions for low-income women, and with a Republican Congress, he is willing to make that a matter of law. Trump’s journey to the right is by no means limited to abortion rights. Earlier this year, Trump said he had no problem with trans people using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Later, he backtracked, saying states such as North Carolina should have the ability to dictate which facilities a trans person can use. There is one big exception to Trump’s rightward tilt. For the first time in recent memory, Trump, as the Republican nominee for president, proposed a national plan to guarantee paid family leave. (“Wow!” he said when he announced his plan at rallies.) But the plan doesn’t get you very far if you’re not wealthy, or, in the case of parental leave, if you’re not a woman who has given birth. Trump has proposed giving women six weeks of leave at the same rate as their state’s unemployment benefits. The plan only covers women who have given birth and does not cover fathers at all, nor women who become mothers through adoption or surrogacy. Trump also proposes allowing families to deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, but economists have criticized the plan as both expensive to taxpayers and of marginal benefit for low-income families. Molly Redden Wall Street Trump has a difficult and confusing relationship with Wall Street and it’s not likely to get any better now that he is in the White House. Stock markets soared the day before the election when the FBI announced it was not going to reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, a move investors bet would boost her chances of election. On Wednesday global markets crashed and the US looked set to follow in the wake of his surprise victory but soon recovered on the back of a conciliatory victory speech from Trump. Trump has been seen as bad for business. Big banks don’t like his anti-trade policies and the instability his foreign policies might bring. But in some ways Wall Street could find they have a new friend in the White House, as long as they are prepared to suck up to him. On the campaign trail Trump has consistently railed against Dodd-Frank, the financial rules brought in after the last financial crisis in an attempt to curb Wall Street’s excessive appetite for risk. “We have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren’t loaning money to people that need it … The regulators are running the banks,” he told Fox News last October. Wall Street would be happy with less regulation but it might not be so happy with Trump’s tax plans. “The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder … They’re paying nothing, and it’s ridiculous,” he told CBS’s Face The Nation last August. He is proposing to end a tax loophole that allows billionaire hedge fund managers to pay the 20% capital gains tax rate rather than the 39.6% top rate of income tax. He’s also promised to get tough on Wall Street (although confusingly not with regulation). “I know the people on Wall Street. We’re going to have the greatest negotiators of the world, but at the same time I’m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We’re going to tax Wall Street,” Trump said at a rally in January. But his first test may well be the mega-merger of AT&T and Time Warner. Trump has already called the $85bn deal a threat to democracy. If his first move is to signal that the deal is off, Wall Street may worry that businesses will put future deals on hold as long as he’s in the White House. Dominic Rushe Climate change At a pivotal time when greenhouse gas emissions must be drastically shrunk in order to prevent climate breakdown, the world’s largest economy is now headed by a man who believes climate change is a hoax, perhaps perpetrated by the Chinese. The doomsday moment for a livable climate could well be a step closer with the election of Trump, environmentalists fear. One of Trump’s first tasks is likely to be withdrawing the US from the Paris climate deal, making it an outlier among the planet’s functioning governments, which have all signed up to the accord. The exit process will take around four years, so the US would be on its own in time for Trump’s second term or a new president’s first. The US quitting the Paris deal could bring the whole edifice down, making the steep challenge of keeping the global temperature increase to 2C close to impossible. This would result in a sea level rise that would inundate millions of Americans’ homes, cause punishing heatwaves, trigger the spread of disease and disastrous extreme weather events, and threaten America’s national security. But the worst of these consequences would unfold after Trump’s presidency, so he could concentrate on his other environmental policies. He’s hinted at scrapping the Environmental Protection Agency, tasking Myron Ebell, a leading climate change denier, to head his EPA transition team. Trump has also promised to cut all federal climate spending, which would encompass billions of dollars spent on clean energy development and hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to countries at greatest risk from climate change. Trump has said he will “end the war on coal and the war on miners” in order to reboot the industry, while also expanding drilling for natural gas. He has not explained how these contradictory policies will be achieved, given that the advance of gas has caused the decline in coal, but has insisted upon an “America first” stance on energy. He might also want to start building a sea wall for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, as he is doing at his Irish golf course. Oliver Milman Gun control Trump’s win is a tremendous victory for the National Rifle Association, which endorsed him early and has been one of his staunchest allies. Trump has pledged to roll back gun restrictions to make gun-carrying legal in more places, including on military bases and perhaps in schools. He said he supports a new federal law that would make concealed carry permits issued in one state valid across the country. This legislation, long a policy priority for gun owners, could undermine the current strict local gun restrictions in states like California and New York. In what was the NRA’s central priority this election, Trump also promised to nominate a staunchly pro-gun supreme court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, which would protect and perhaps even broaden the court’s landmark 2008 Heller decision protecting Americans’ right to own guns for self-defense. To reduce the toll of gun violence, Trump has argued that law enforcement should be “tougher” and has dubbed himself the “law and order candidate”, a stance that cuts against what had been a growing bipartisan consensus that America’s criminal justice system is too expensive and too punitive. “We need to get serious about prosecuting violent criminals,” Trump’s second amendment policy briefing reads. “Violent crime in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and many others is out of control. Drug dealers and gang members are given a slap on the wrist and turned loose on the street. This needs to stop.” Trump has suggested resurrecting a controversial Bush-era federal program, Project Exile, which encouraged US attorneys to use the threat of tougher federal prosecutions for gun crimes to attempt to deter gun violence. He said in August that he believed Chicago police could put a stop to the city’s spiraling gun violence epidemic “in one week” by “being very much tougher”. The key, he said, was “using tough police tactics, which is OK when people are being killed”. Trump has also argued that laws that “empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves” are “another way to fight crime”. Lois Beckett Criminal justice Trump comes into office having mostly either antagonized or ignored the growing and vocal number of Americans demanding criminal justice reform. Instead, most of Trump’s campaign promises around criminal justice focused on restoring “law and order”. Trump also frequently made factually unsupported statements about about violent crime rates nationwide and their historical context. Trump has been characteristically vague on justice reform. But he has repeatedly pledged support for police officers and law enforcement in the face of public criticism. Candidate Trump has expressed an interest in the continued privatization of prisons, and has criticized President Obama for cutting short the sentences of long-serving nonviolent drug offenders, calling grantees “bad dudes”. He proposed a law mandating the death penalty for anyone convicted of killing a police officer. Among Trump’s first targets may be rolling back the Obama administration’s unilateral efforts to address mass incarceration. Trump plans to immediately halt the president’s Clemency 2014 initiative, which in 2016 cut short a record number of federal prison sentences. Trump is also likely to undo the executive order signed by the president in May 2015 to curb the transfer of military equipment to police departments. A veto threat from Trump could thwart any potential for passage of the bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act introduced to Congress last year by the Republican senator Chuck Grassley. The bill proposes to reduce mandatory minimum sentencing for non-violent crimes. His election, along with the Republican sweep of both chambers of Congress, seems to squelch any hope of more progressive reform from lawmakers. A Trump-led Department of Justice and FBI could also spell doom for federal efforts to track police use of force and killings by the police, as Trump has not identified the current lack of data as a priority at any point during the presidential campaign. Trump could also instruct his justice department to change course on its move away from private prisons announced in August. A Trump presidency surely means the end of any collaboration or mutual understanding between the White House and Black Lives Matter activists and reformers. Trump has repeatedly declared that police ought to be granted more power, rather than less, which runs counter to many reform goals. Various White House initiatives aimed at promoting collaborative reform between police and communities, and finding less punitive solutions to criminal justice challenges are also likely to come to a crashing halt. Jamiles Lartey', 'When Donald Trump takes the oath of office on 20 January, the fact he will be the oldest person to do so in America’s 240-year history will be something of an afterthought. On that day a business tycoon, reality TV celebrity and architect of one of the most divisive and incendiary campaigns in memory – a campaign that has raised comparisons to Hitler and Mussolini – will become the most powerful person on the planet, his finger on the nuclear trigger. This is no ordinary candidate in no ordinary year. Trump will be the first person in more than 60 years to enter the White House with no experience as a governor or on Capitol Hill. Many words have been used by critics to describe him: bigot, blowhard, demagogue, idiot, misogynist, narcissist, racist, sexual predator. Tony Schwartz, who ghost-wrote Trump’s bestselling book The Art of the Deal, said if he was writing it now, he would call it The Sociopath.\\nTrump is “the blue-collar billionaire” who lives the high life of golf and private jets but appeals to those who feel dispossessed and believe the American dream is dead. He launched his campaign in June 2015 with a tirade against immigrants – he branded Mexicans criminals and rapists – although he himself is descended from them. His mother, Mary MacLeod, was from Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides, once described by Trump as “serious Scotland”. His father, Fred, was the son of Friedrich Trump, who at 16 arrived on a boat in lower Manhattan in 1885, learned English and became a US citizen. Setting up home in Queens, New York, Fred Trump built a property empire and became one of the city’s biggest developers and landlords. Donald Trump was born there on 14 June 1946, the fourth of five children. On Sundays the family worshipped at Marble Collegiate church in Manhattan, where the head pastor was Norman Vincent Peale, dubbed “God’s salesman” and author of The Power Of Positive Thinking. That book influenced the young Trump with advice such as: “Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding. Hold this picture tenaciously. Never permit it to fade. Your mind will seek to develop the picture … Do not build up obstacles in your imagination.”\\nTrump had a rebellious streak and, aged 13, his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy in hope of instilling discipline. It worked. He thrived on the competition over everything from tidying his room to shining his shoes and climbed the ranks. Through five educational and medical deferments during the Vietnam war, Trump would never serve in the US military, but he claimed that the school gave him “more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military”. Trump went on to Fordham University, then the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a degree in economics in 1968. He joined his father’s business, helping manage residential housing projects for the middle class in New York boroughs Brooklyn and Queens, and became favourite to succeed him after his elder brother, a pilot, died at 43 due to alcoholism. It was a tragedy that Trump said led him to avoid alcohol, cigarettes and drugs all his life.\\nTrump took control of the company in 1971, renaming it the Trump Organization, and claimed his father gave him a “small loan of a million dollars” to help. The firm expanded into Manhattan, transforming the rundown Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and erecting the 58-storey Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, which serves as both his primary residence and the headquarters of the Trump Organization. In 1973 the Trumps were charged with racial bias in their rental practices before reaching a settlement with the US government. Other properties bearing his name followed, including golf courses, the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, New York’s venerable Plaza Hotel and casinos. Around the world there were Trump Towers in Mumbai, Istanbul and the Philippines. But Trump’s business record – crucial to his election message – is chequered. Setbacks included Trump University, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airlines and Trump Vodka as well as four casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Despite piling up a vast fortune over the years, Trump has seen his companies file at least four bankruptcies. During the second presidential debate, Trump admitted using a $916m loss claimed in 1995 to avoid paying federal income tax for many years. According to Forbes, Trump’s net worth is $3.7bn, although he has repeatedly claimed he is worth $10bn. Trump also moved into the entertainment industry, owning the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015. In 2003, his celebrity soared with The Apprentice, the TV show in which contestants battled for a shot at a management job within his organisation and he could say with relish, “You’re fired!” He claimed in a financial disclosure form that he was paid a total of $213m by NBC.\\nBut as far-fetched as it seems, Trump’s hostile takeover of the political scene is not entirely unexpected. Once a registered Democrat and donor to the party, he reportedly expressed an interest in running for president as early as 1987 and entered the 2000 race as a Reform party candidate. He also led the “birther movement” after repeatedly questioning the birthplace of Barack Obama. He finally conceded this year that the US president was born in Hawaii but offered no apology, fuelling the allegation that he had run a racially charged, white nativist campaign.\\nLast December, in a speech following the deaths of 14 people in a terrorist shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, he said: “Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.” The pledge was later altered to cover people “from regions that export terrorism”. Yet his dark vision of America, and his promise to make it “great again”, resonated with swaths of the country, especially white men who felt themselves economically and culturally in retreat. He defeated 16 rivals in the Republican primary, including Jeb Bush, the son and brother of past presidents, and arch-conservative Ted Cruz, with a record number of votes. His rallies were like rock star events – he called his campaign a movement – even as he hurled insults and trampled over numerous political norms and values. Not even a 2005 video in which he boasted about groping women, and subsequent allegations of harassment from a dozen women, could derail him. “I have great respect for women,” he improbably asserted. “Nobody has more respect for women than I do.” His private life is far from conventional for a president. His first marriage to Czech athlete and model Ivana Zelníčková ended in divorce in 1990. The couple had three children, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric, all of whom have become prominent surrogates on the trail. In a 2006 interview on The View, Trump said: “If Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.” He married actor Marla Maples in 1993 before they separated in 1997 and divorced in 1999; they have one daughter, Tiffany. The billionaire began dating his third wife, Slovenian-born model Melania Knauss, in 1998. The pair married in 2005 – the Clintons were among the guests – and a year later their son, Barron, was born.\\nTrump once said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York and not lose a single vote. It more or less proved to be true.', 'Another day, another story about Donald Trump. It seems we can’t go more than three minutes without the US presidential candidate doing or saying something that makes global headlines. You know that story about the child whose father catches him smoking so makes him smoke the whole pack of cigarettes until he’s sick? Political correspondents and journalists must be feeling like that child right now. But is there anyone left who Trump hasn’t offended? Women. Muslims. Mexicans. Soldiers. Disabled people. The media. Fellow republicans. Grieving parents. Babies. He’s like what you’d get if Prince Phillip and Boris Johnson had a baby which was raised in the most intolerant parts of America. By Katie Hopkins. It would seem weird, then, to see him defended in the pages of the Guardian. He’s usually only defended by his die-hard fans and people with more “old fashioned” values like, most recently, Clint Eastwood. Despite this, the point of this piece is to defend Trump. Sort of. Well, not quite. The point is, a US Democrat has started a petition to evaluate Trump’s mental health. The Democrat Representative Karen Bass, who is medically qualified, in fairness, argues that Trump displays all the classic signs of narcissistic personality disorder. Given his general behaviour and apparent thinking, it’s a pretty compelling argument. The petition states that “It is our patriotic duty to raise the question of his mental stability to be the commander in chief and leader of the free world”. However, even if we give the benefit of a doubt and assume this petition has purely noble and not cynically political intentions, there are several reasons why it’s a bad idea.\\nAmateur diagnosis from a distance is rarely helpful It’s a fairly modern and widespread phenomenon, but diagnosing prominent people with mental disorders based on their public appearances is a very unfortunate tendency. It’s easy to see footage or reports of someone you don’t like or whose actions you don’t agree with, and conclude that they have some form of mental health issue based on your limited knowledge of such things. The fact is, diagnosing a mental health problem is a very complicated and often uncertain process. Many people, usually GPs, complain about patients using “Doctor Google”; looking up their symptoms on the web and deciding on a diagnosis. Unfortunately, trained medics spend years learning about the subtleties, nuances and probabilities of physical illnesses which allows them to make a more informed (and more likely correct) diagnosis. You can’t substitute all that training with a few algorithms and a web search. Even medical doctors without psychiatric training can struggle. Diagnosing someone else, from a distance, with a mental disorder, without their cooperation, is way more unreliable procedure again. Successfully diagnosing someone with a mental health problem usually involves spending hours with them on a one-to-one basis, discussing their own feelings, moods, perceptions, beliefs etc. What someone does and says on stage in front of thousands/in the presence of the global media will be very informative, but it won’t be sufficient grounds for a diagnosis. And that’s all we have for Trump really; his “public” persona. I don’t know him personally, and unless you’re a trained psychologist who does, your grounds for diagnosing him will be very flimsy indeed.\\nIt perpetuates stigma The very concept of the petition to diagnose Trump is, even if well meant, needlessly stigmatising. It argues that Trump behaves in these unpleasant ways, so needs to be mentally assessed, and if he’s found to have a mental disorder he should be disqualified from becoming president. Thing is… what if he is diagnosed and it turns out he doesn’t have a disorder? Despite all the “obvious signs”, disorders are seldom so clear cut. Jon Ronson’s The Psychopath Test revealed many examples of where even the most “clear cut” cases showed complexities and inconsistencies that confuse and cloud the issue. So if Trump were given a clean bill of health, does that mean he’s fine to be president? He’s exactly the same person as he was before the psychiatric evaluation, why would a diagnosis of a disorder make him suddenly unsuitable if he wasn’t before? Also, given Trump’s previous behaviour and that of his supporters, what are the odds he would care about a diagnosis made of him? He’d probably use it to his advantage somehow, knowing him. An important thing to remember is this; it’s entirely possible to be sexist/racist//paranoid/arrogant/offensive/generally awful without having some form of mental disorder. Similarly, it’s entirely possible to have a mental disorder and be none of these things, in fact be a perfectly lovely competent person. People with mental health conditions have enough trouble being trusted by people thanks to the media as it is, without being blamed for every violent crime or offensive outburst. If you think Trump is completely unsuited to being president because of all that he does, a diagnosis of a disorder shouldn’t be necessary. Otherwise it’s just needlessly stigmatising those with mental health concerns. Odds are, Trump will have done that himself by the time you read this. Why help him?\\nWhy just Trump? There is, no doubt, a good case to be made for the argument that somebody in charge of a superpower with a nuclear arsenal should have the best possible mental health. It’s clearly a very hard and stressful job, and if you’re already vulnerable to such things and they risk hampering your ability to function then perhaps the role isn’t for you. So, therefore, Trump should be psychologically evaluated, to make sure he’s fit for the job. But, why should only Trump be subjected to this scrutiny? Admittedly he is a very divisive figure who constantly says things that millions of people object to and seems pathologically driven to advance his standing. But don’t all those things apply to Hilary Clinton? Or Barack Obama? Or, in a relentlessly-capitalist politically-polarised country like the USA, pretty much anyone who volunteers to run for president as part of a major political party? There have also been many arguments that Trump is just the end result of a Republican party that has used the same arguments/tactics for years, Trump has just taken the ball and run with it. You could argue that he’s just more honest and open in his bigotry than others in his party who hide it behind spin and dense language. These could be viewed as positive qualities possessed by Trump. Relatively speaking, at least. Essentially, if you’re going to insist on a president having robust mental health, then this standard must be applied to everyone, not just the most “outrageous” candidates. And given the specific personalities needed to even want to be president and the subjective, ever-changing nature of how mental health disorders are diagnosed, who’s to say anyone who wants to be president will make the cut? In summary: Trump has provided a bountiful cornucopia of reasons to criticise and condemn him, so don’t go needlessly dragging mentally unwell people into the apocalyptic circus that surrounds him. Don’t they have enough to deal with as it is? Dean Burnett further covers the principles of mental health and public attitudes to it in his debut book The Idiot Brain, available now in the UK, USA and Canada.', 'He has lurched from crisis to crisis, insulted the world and been repeatedly accused of racism and sexual assault – but more than one in 10 Britons would still vote for Donald Trump, a new poll has revealed. An Opinium/Observer poll has found 12% of UK adults would vote for the Republican candidate if they were able to take part in next Tuesday’s presidential election, compared with 49% for Hillary Clinton. Opinium surveyed 2,001 adults between 1 and 4 November, a week in which polls narrowed amid the fallout from the FBI’s decision to review a new batch of Clinton’s staff’s emails. Perhaps unsurprisingly, men are more than twice as likely to support Trump, with 16% expressing a preference for him compared with just 8% of women. However, in a reflection of both candidates’ underlying unpopularity, almost a third of respondents (32%) said they would not vote for either. The findings also suggest that the election is widely considered a foregone conclusion despite a late surge in support for Trump: 48% of UK adults expect Clinton to win the presidency, while 18% think a Trump victory is most likely. Of supporters of the major UK parties, only among Ukip voters did supporters of Trump outnumber those of Clinton: 43% of the party’s voters would back the divisive billionaire, who has enlisted the support of Nigel Farage and compared his campaign to the Brexit movement. The survey shows the Democratic candidate soundly beating Trump on a range of issues, including relations with Britain and global security. The Republican candidate, who has praised Vladimir Putin and suggested the US could withdraw from Nato under his presidency, is deemed a risk to international stability by 62% of Britons. Similarly, few voters believe a Trump victory would be good for Britain’s so-called special relationship with the US. Just 16% of those surveyed said he would be a friend to the UK as president, compared with 41% for Clinton. Meanwhile, 53% think the British government should seek to improve its relationships with countries other than the US if Trump wins. Widespread dislike for Trump among the British public is also reflected by the words most commonly associated with the candidate. Dangerous (71%) was the most common word, followed by hate (61%) and fear (60%). Clinton inspires a more positive reaction. According to the poll, she is most associated with intelligence (58%), maturity (55%), and competence (50%).', 'After the incredulity, the despair, and then the cautious return to optimism, the presidential campaign has entered a phase of almost intolerable anxiety. National polls that don’t signify much are instantly interpreted as omens of the apocalypse; tiny anecdotes about early voting figures induce heart-stopping panic, or get clung to like life-rafts, depending on the direction in which they point. Until Tuesday, no new information is likely to bring any sense of closure, only more stress, but that doesn’t stop us from seeking it compulsively.\\nNever mind that a victory for Donald Trump, at this point, would still require him to have executed a turnaround unknown in living memory, or that the nervous comparisons with Brexit have been so overblown. (Plenty of polls predicted a victory for Brexit – and there are many reasons to assume the tapestry of state and national US polls is less error-prone than for a simple majority referendum.) In the closing days of an election that has kept Americans and non-Americans alike in a state of clenched-stomach tension for months, allowing yourself any confidence in a victory for Hillary Clinton feels like mocking the gods. Even assuming Trump loses, the relief will be superficial: Trumpism will remain, and the world will have to contend with the fact that about 40% of the US electorate saw little wrong with his racism and misogyny, alleged sexual assaults, business scandals, lies, misrepresentations of his wealth and charitable giving, probable failure to pay taxes, lack of impulse control, profound ignorance and tiny attention span. But the relief will still be real.\\nIn a way that feels unprecedented in modern politics, Trump has burrowed deep into our psyches, stimulating anxiety that isn’t confined to the borders of the US, or to those who are the direct targets of his bigotry. A survey for the American Psychological Association published in October found that the election was a source of stress for 52% of American adults; during the summer, 70% of registered voters – that is, including Trump supporters – said the prospect of a Trump presidency made them anxious, according to a Washington Post poll. (The figure for Clinton was 50%.) There have been multiple reports of election-related fears arising on therapists’ couches as never before, along with anecdotes of relationships damaged by political disagreement. “I think what’s been so uniquely distressing isn’t just that there’s one person out there who thinks like that, but that there are clearly so many people who agree,” says Joan Cook, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University and an expert in traumatic stress. (She thinks Trump’s hardcore supporters, meanwhile, are in the grip of “traumatic bonding”, as with Stockholm syndrome – an emotional dependence forged through abuse.) This is a kind of psychological entanglement with national and international news that most of us, most of the time, are spared; but the Trump candidacy has removed the possibility of such distance. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network reported a 33% increase in calls to its support hotline during the weekend following the release of Trump’s notorious Access Hollywood tape. Armchair diagnosis: dos and don’ts Alongside its psychological impact on the rest of us, the campaign has also felt distinctive – and distinctively disturbing – in the ways that Trump’s own psychology has come to dominate it. While Hillary Clinton’s inner life remains largely mysterious, information about Trump’s insecurities leaks from his every public statement – even before the New York Times obtained tapes of interviews with a biographer in which Trump’s morbid fear of public humiliation was made plain. His former ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz, has pointed out how Trump’s attacks on others aren’t random, but constitute a precise inventory of his own faults: “unstable”, “reckless”, “bigoted”, “trigger-happy”, exhausted and prone to lying. As Sheena Monnin, the former Miss Pennsylvania sued by Trump after she criticized his Miss USA pageant, put it in an interview with CNN: “I have a degree in psychology, and I understand that underneath the bullying tactics, there’s usually a lot of emptiness, and a strong need to feed the ego.”\\nTrump told his biographer Michael D’Antonio: “I don’t like to analyse myself, because I might not like what I see.” But the rest of us haven’t had much choice. Like a traffic pile-up, the candidate’s involuntary self-exposure has been impossible not to gawp at. (On that note, the October APA survey found that the election was having a significant negative impact on productivity.) Yet throughout this intensely psychological election, psychology professionals have been restrained by a widespread, though fragmenting, consensus that Trump’s mental health ought not to be discussed at all. This stance is most clearly expressed in the American Psychiatric Association’s so-called Goldwater rule – the prohibition on diagnosis-at-a-distance introduced following the incident in 1964 when 1,100 psychiatrists told a news magazine they believed that Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for president, was unfit for office. In a finger-wagging statement released in August (“The Goldwater rule: why breaking it is unethical and irresponsible”), the APA’s president, Maria Oquendo, reaffirmed the ban. But while there are certainly strong arguments in favour of it – it risks undermining public confidence in psychiatrists, and stigmatising people with mental illness – it’s been far from obvious, in 2016, that these outweigh the ethical arguments for flouting it. Writing in Vox, the psychologist Cedar Riener compared psychiatrists disregarding the rule to a doctor diagnosing cancer “just by looking at my behaviour or public statements”. But in the case of psychological disorders, unlike physical illnesses, behaviour and speech are always the primary sources of diagnostic data. And it has often seemed as if we might have more direct access to the darkest recesses of Trump’s mind than to some of our closest friends. “Like many Americans, I was more amused than alarmed by Trump at the beginning,” says Bill Doherty, a marriage and family therapist from Minnesota. But as the Trump movement picked up steam, Doherty happened to be travelling in Austria, where he encountered a neo-fascist political demonstration and visited a concentration camp. “So I did some reading about the responses of mental health professionals in Germany and Austria in the 1930s, and they were largely silent, and some were complicit.” Upon his return, he wrote a manifesto – Citizen Therapists Against Trumpism – which more than 3,300 of his colleagues have now signed. Doherty insists this doesn’t violate the Goldwater rule – he’s condemning Trumpism as a threat to public health, not diagnosing Trump as, say, a narcissist or sociopath, the disorders most frequently attributed to him. As “citizen therapists”, Doherty says, “we must be willing to speak out on issues that affect the mental health of our clients, instead of just sitting in our offices and dealing with the fallout.” Trump-induced distress is especially acute, he says, for anyone who has been exposed to a personality style like his – focused on bullying, scapegoating and the kneejerk demeaning of critics – earlier in their personal lives. His status as a presidential candidate “brings legitimacy to his way of relating to other people. There have always been personalities like Trump, but his power and the hundreds of people at his rallies say to anyone who has any psychological vulnerability that, yes, their fears were legitimate, and that there’s no accountability for anyone who says and does these things. And that’s exactly what’s happened in their lives: there’s been no accountability for the people who harmed them.” Daddy issues: ‘a fantasy of being rescued by a powerful father figure’ Beyond the confines of therapy, the rise of Trump has demonstrated more broadly how bad we are at understanding politics in psychological terms. For months, an almost entirely futile debate between pundits has sought to establish whether Trump’s supporters are motivated by economic anxiety or by racism, as if the two could be neatly distinguished and measured.\\nFor Jonathan Shedler, professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado school of medicine, his appeal is better understood through the lens of “transference”: in times of stress, whatever the complex blend of causes for that stress, people revert to a childhood desire for an omnipotent protector – an understandable need in young children, but dysfunctional in adulthood. “Trump is benefiting from a childlike fantasy of being rescued by an all-powerful, larger-than-life father figure, so all of these qualities get attributed to Trump,” he says. If the candidate’s serially outrageous behaviour fails to alienate them, that’s at least partly because the appealing qualities they’re seeing aren’t really in him; instead, “they’re in the minds of the people who are doing the attributing, expressing their not-quite-conscious yearnings.” Meanwhile, the question of whether Trump himself is suffering from a personality disorder is beside the point, Shedler argues – the consequence of trying to force our thinking about personality into a “medical model” in which narcissism or antisocial attitudes, like cancer, are discrete diseases, invading an otherwise healthy body. But Trump’s narcissism, insecurities and viciousness are intrinsic components of who he is, and they’ve already damaged the world’s wellbeing – whether or not they’re best thought of as formal disorders.\\nAt a rally in Henderson, Nevada, earlier this month, Trump told supporters: “If I don’t win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime, by a factor of 100.” It was a fairly typical statement from Trump, in its profound self-absorption and total lack of interest in the impact of his victory or defeat on the country he proposes to lead. But it was also an especially infuriating one, given the extraordinary quantities of attention and emotional energy Trump has already squandered – not his, but ours. If he loses on 8 November, that won’t mark the end of the problem he represents. But it may nonetheless be a rich source of delight to savor the departure of the toxic uninvited guest who has spent the last year so stubbornly resident in our brains.', 'Did you hear about the Florida newspaper that apologized to its readers for running too much news that was critical of Donald Trump? It happened last week at the Daily Commercial, based in Leesburg, Florida, in a conservative-leaning area of the state with a lot of affluent retirees nearby. The editors published an open letter to readers in which they wrote: “The Daily Commercial hasn’t done enough to mitigate the anti-Trump wave in the pages of this paper ... This is not an endorsement of Trump, a candidate whose brutish, sometimes childish antics are responsible for his sizable deficit in the polls. Rather, it is a recognition that you, the voter, deserve better than we in the media have given you. You deserve a more balanced approach.” I have frequently observed in my press criticism that mainstream journalists sometimes place protecting themselves against criticism before serving their readers. This is troubling because that kind of self-protection has far less legitimacy than the duties of journalism, especially when the criticism itself is barely valid. This is how the phrase “working the refs” got started. Political actors try to influence judgment calls by screeching about bias, whether the charge is warranted or not. My favorite description of “protecting ourselves against criticism” comes from a former reporter for the Washington Post, Paul Taylor, in his 1990 book about election coverage, See How They Run. I have quoted it many times: Sometimes I worry that my squeamishness about making sharp judgments, pro or con, makes me unfit for the slam-bang world of daily journalism. Other times I conclude that it makes me ideally suited for newspapering – certainly for the rigors and conventions of modern ‘objective’ journalism. For I can dispose of my dilemmas by writing stories straight down the middle. I can search for the halfway point between the best and the worst that might be said about someone (or some policy or idea) and write my story in that fair-minded place. By aiming for the golden mean, I probably land near the best approximation of truth more often than if I were guided by any other set of compasses – partisan, ideological, psychological, whatever ... Yes, I am seeking truth. But I’m also seeking refuge. I’m taking a pass on the toughest calls I face. I am seeking truth. But I’m also seeking refuge. What if it’s not possible to do both? This is what the editors of the Daily Commercial failed to ask themselves. And this is what the movement for Trump is forcing journalists everywhere in the US to realize, even if word hasn’t reached Leesburg, Florida. A few weeks ago, Dean Baquet, editor of the New York Times, said Donald Trump had changed journalism. I was either editor or managing editor of the LA Times during the Swift Boat incident. Newspapers did not know — we did not quite know how to do it. I remember struggling with the reporter, Jim Rainey, who covers the media now, trying to get him to write the paragraph that laid out why the Swift Boat allegation was false ... We didn’t know how to write the paragraph that said: “This is just false...” We struggle with that. I think that Trump has ended that struggle. Some of you may wonder: in 1990, in 2004 or in 2016 how could it be hard to say in a news report “this is false” when the reporter and the editor are both persuaded that it is false? I have an answer for you. Alongside the production of news, reporters and editors in the mainstream press have for a long time been engaged in another manufacture: persuading us of their own innocence, especially when it comes to a contested election.\\nTrump has ended the struggle in this sense: by openly trashing the norms of American politics, Trump has made it a certainty that when honest journalism is done about him it also works against him, by exposing his many falsehoods. Because of the way he campaigns – because of who he is – when he’s in the news he’s typically losing ground. For journalists this destroys the illusion of innocence: just by doing your job you are undoing Trump ... unless he can turn his portion of the electorate against you so decisively that the very possibility that you may be trying to do an honest job is rejected out of hand. And then the disaster is complete, for now by doing your job (applying scrutiny, checking facts) you are actually helping Trump, confirming among his most committed supporters the hateful image of a media elite trying to rig the election. Either way the production of innocence fails. In this vexing situation the Daily Commercial of Leesburg, Florida published its open letter to readers. Unable to think it through clearly, the editors surrendered their right to speak truth to power and sold out their colleagues in the national press. “Yes, I am seeking truth. But I’m also seeking refuge.” For journalists covering this election, and for the American press in the years after, the days of doing both are over. Pick one.', 'Evangelicals in the 2016 election have proven loyal to the Republican Party in spite of Donald Trump’s continued ... moral issues. In the latest PRRI poll, white evangelicals are the largest religious group, with 66% of them supporting Trump. This support has created fissures in the movement, with some evangelicals protesting Trump, while others such as Jerry Falwell Jr are comparing Trump to King David.\\nIf Trump loses the election, the only unifying issues evangelicals will have left are abortion and their hatred of Hillary Clinton. Even with these, they stand to become less influential in political activity. In the past, candidates’ performances of “Christianity” have been strong points for voters, but Trump’s ascendancy with evangelicals has eviscerated that expectation. Evangelicals, like other voters, can be very pragmatic about the issues they want addressed by the leadership they support. In the 2016 election cycle, evangelicals are concerned about the supreme courts, Isis, Islam and nostalgia, as Robert Jones shows. For evangelical voters, these issues trump the candidate’s personal morality. Loyalty to Trump has not only a moral but also a structural cost. It will not mean the “Religious Right” is finished, rather that Catholics, Mormons and other religious conservatives will be better positioned to carry its values, lessening evangelical influence. Mormons have been very opposed to Trump, and Catholic voters are evenly split between Trump and Clinton. They, not evangelicals, will be able to claim the values high ground post-election. Trump has also proven that Republican presidential candidates do not necessarily have to pander to power brokers such as Bob Vanderplaats, head of the Family Leader in Iowa, or Tony Perkins of Family Research Council. Trump amassed his own coterie of Prosperity Gospel preachers who were not traditional evangelical leaders, such as Paula White, and as a result reached a whole other segment of the religious population more in tune with Trump’s promise of returning economic prosperity and his use of the media. Even James Dobson, longtime evangelical leader of Focus on the Family, had to use White to convince his following that Trump was really a “baby Christian” because she had led him to Christ. Trump has changed the ecosystem of the evangelical world, breaking the usual evangelical synergies that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio worked diligently during the 2016 presidential campaign. As a result, it will be difficult for those choosing to run in the 2020 election cycle to play the cycle of business as usual in courting the evangelical vote. Merely spouting faith-based language and talking about religious freedom did not gather evangelical votes this cycle as well as Trump’s language of the decline of America, terrorism and fear of immigrants did. Whether Trump knew it or not, his strong language tapped into evangelical beliefs about the “last days” and America’s role in biblical prophecy. Samantha Bee jokingly asked: “Are evangelicals that ready to get the apocalypse going?” by voting for Trump, but their fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency has activated their apocalyptic fervor. Trump has benefitted indirectly from a strong belief of evangelicals that the two terms of Barack Obama has led the country to the brink of destruction. Obama was bad enough in their eyes; having the Clintons back in the White House would be the end. So while evangelicals are coming together to support Trump, internal frictions are many. Evangelical women are upset about Trump and the accusations of sexual and verbal abuse of women, and many are angered that their male counterparts have been silent about it. Evangelical women are also large consumers of evangelical media and ministries, and their support of these organizations is crucial. Should they shun both Trump and the predominately male evangelical leadership, it may have a ripple effect in these organizations’ fundraising abilities and their ministerial efforts. Similarly, younger evangelicals and evangelicals of color are very opposed to Trump. Jim Wallis of Sojourners is very vocal that “not all evangelicals” support Trump, but only white evangelicals are being polled about their political support, not African Americans or Latinos. This brings up the biggest issue that evangelicals face with their support of Trump: that they will be seen as agreeing with Trump’s “alt right” contingent that is not interested in religion, but rather in white nationalism and the restoration of white America. As a result, evangelicals who have claimed to be “colorblind” find themselves aligning with hate groups who support Trump and are also against Jews and Israel, both important to evangelicals and their beliefs. All of these issues pose important structural and political problems for evangelicals after the 2016 election. I believe that the various coalitions under the evangelical umbrella will be in disarray. Evangelicals will fade in political and social clout on the national stage regarding religious liberty, abortion and the coveted replacement of Antonin Scalia on the US supreme court. Supporting Trump on election day may have many evangelicals gritting their teeth in the ballot box, but it is nothing compared to the aftermath if their “King David” loses.', 'The Australian actor Cate Blanchett has described Donald Trump’s ascendancy as “absurd and ridiculous” during a spot on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where she was promoting her Broadway debut in The Present. After sitting down for the interview, the actor took gum out of her mouth, placed it on the desk in front of her, and began moulding it into a penis. “The phallus seems an appropriate symbol for this country right now – with tiny little balls,” she said. In a following segment, a recurring game titled Emotional Interview, the conversation between Fallon and his guest was interrupted at random points with emotions or situations which the pair had to wrap into their interview – and which, for Blanchett, resulted in a running anti-Trump tirade.\\nAfter one prompt – “gives bad advice” – Blanchett advised the audience to give all their savings to Trump. For another – “uses too many metaphors” – Blanchett brought up the Chekhov adaptation she’s now starring in. “I’m on stage at the moment and it’s really great to be doing something about midlife crises, because it’s absurd and ridiculous – almost as absurd and ridiculous as a man who has filed for corporate bankruptcy four times who is running the largest economy in the world. I mean, it’s almost as crazy as that.” “I feel like a giraffe in space,” replied Fallon, who stayed neutral on the US president throughout. The Present, which stars Blanchett alongside an all-Australian cast, is directed by her husband, Andrew Upton, with whom she co-ran Sydney Theatre Company for five years. “I’ve been sleeping with [him] for 20 years in the hope that he would cast me in the role,” she said. “The casting couch is alive and well.” The actor is also spending her time in New York to film parts of Oceans Eight – an all-female Oceans Eleven spin-off featuring Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, Sarah Paulson, Elizabeth Banks, Mindy Kaling and Helena Bonham Carter.', 'The phone call that would, just hours later, inflict a highly damaging blow to Donald Trump’s presidential ambitions came through to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold mid-morning on Friday 7 October. The source – a Snapchat-era “Deep Throat” – informed Fahrenthold, whose dogged exposure of the operations of the Trump Foundation had so infuriated the billionaire, that they had some previously unaired video of Trump. Would he be interested in viewing it? “David recognised immediately that [the footage] was explosive,” says the Post’s executive editor Martin Baron, “and the first task was to make sure it was authenticated, which he was able to do pretty quickly.” The Post sent a transcript of the video – outtakes from a 2005 edition of the NBC show Access Hollywood, in which Trump is heard bragging that “when you’re a star … you can do anything [to women] … grab them by the pussy” – to the Trump campaign for comment. “They asked us for the actual video,” says the softly-spoken Baron, “and shortly after that they sent us Donald Trump’s initial response.” Five hours on from the tip-off, the video and accompanying piece went live on the Post, reverberating around the world. While Grope-gate (as some are inevitably calling it) may be a far cry from Watergate, the Post’s most famous scoop, it was nevertheless a momentum-shifting event in the presidential race, which has seen Trump, who had previously claimed that he could “shoot somebody” on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue and not lose votes, since struggle to regain his swagger. Yet, while the Trump revelations have lately flowed thick and fast, there has been criticism (even in the Post) that much of the US media was initially slow to take Trump seriously, particularly early on in the Republican primaries. Baron vigorously defends his corner. “At the Post, we took the candidacy seriously from the very beginning,” he insists, going on to cite reporting, among other things, on Trump Mortgage, the Trump University, and his “multiple bankruptcies in Atlantic City”. “Other people reacted in a different way. Certainly there was a tremendous amount of cable coverage of his rallies,” he says. “Wall-to-wall, they would cover his rallies from beginning to end, on live television. I don’t happen to think that was a wise decision on their part.” Baron does concede, however, that Trump is “skilful” at using the media. “[During the primaries] he would call into shows, which would normally require a candidate to show up in person, they would just take his phone call and he’d be on the air, and then he’d call the next show. He’s been by far the most accessible presidential candidate ever.” Indeed, even when the Trump campaign barred the Post’s reporters from his events (for, they claimed, inaccurate reporting), he still made himself available to Baron’s team. “We had actual published interviews with him, [even] while we were on the blacklist,” he says. Born in 1954 and raised in Tampa, Florida, Baron, who’s a fluent Spanish speaker, cut his teeth at the Miami Herald, which he first joined in 1976. He went on to work at some of America’s most prestigious titles – the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the Boston Globe. As Globe editor, the paper won six Pulitzer prizes, including in 2003 for the Spotlight team’s investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic priests, which was turned into the Oscar-winning movie Spotlight last year. In 2013, he became executive editor of the Post, which a little over three years ago was acquired by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for $250m from the Graham family.\\nEarlier this year, the Post – whose traffic numbers reached a record 83.1m unique visitors in September 2016, a 40% year-on-year increase – moved from its former base to a gleaming, light-filled building on K Street, where reporters sit cheek-by-jowl with software engineers. Beyond financial capital, the Amazon CEO has provided the Post with “intellectual capital, too”, Baron explains. “He’s basically forced us to confront how the internet is different and how we have to adapt to it and embrace it. He’s also given us what he calls ‘runway’, which is time to experiment. So, in funding the experiments, we have time to let them play out, without having to adhere to some strict timeline or strict requirements for profit.” One area Bezos was especially keen that Baron address was the issue of aggregation. “One of the first questions he asked was: ‘You do these long narratives, these deep investigations, but after you’re published, within 15 minutes, half a dozen websites have decided to aggregate you – and they get more traffic than you do. How do you propose to deal with that?’” Baron’s solution was, in effect, to fight fire with fire; hiring in-house bloggers, not only did the Post start aggregating itself, but it began aggregating other people’s content too. Since acquiring the Post, Bezos – who’s added 140 employees in three years – has held regular conference calls with senior staff. So how interested is he in the editorial side of the paper? The question isn’t even complete before Baron jumps in: “He doesn’t inject himself at all into our journalism. He doesn’t suggest stories for us to do. He doesn’t critique us in any way. Every once in a while, when he sees a story which delights him, he tells us.\\n“[The conference calls] are all about tactics and strategy. We talked about aggregation, way back when. We’ve talked about our audience engagement team. But in terms of particular stories, particular projects, or particular avenues of coverage, he does not get involved at all.” When asked what he thinks the Post’s output and business model will look like in five years time, Baron concedes that he simply doesn’t know. “I always say the people who are most certain about what the model will be are the furthest removed from any responsibility for actually making that model occur,” he says a touch world-wearily. “There’s so much that’s happened so fast, and the pace of change has really accelerated. Today we’re sitting here talking about what we are doing for Facebook Live. Or what we’re doing for Snapchat. We’re talking about using bots for Amazon Echo, which we did to provide scores during the Olympics. And during this election we’ll be [using bots] to provide election results. [These aren’t] things we talked about a year ago – maybe we should have, but we didn’t.” Despite his ink-stained background, Baron believes that if institutions such as the Post are to survive, they have to think and behave like technology companies: they need to move fast, take risks, and accept that failure is an essential part of experimentation. “I think people [at the Post] do feel free to propose new ideas and try new things,” he says. “And there’s no penalty for failing. If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.” But, he adds quickly, newspapers must always stick to their principles and values. “We can never violate that. If we do, then we destroy our entire argument for existence.” CV Age: 62 Education: Lehigh University, Pennsylvania. BA Journalism 1972-1976; MBA 1975-1976.

Asked by reporters on the campaign plane to respond specifically to a new ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll which put Trump one point ahead, the aide described it as “bad polling”. “It’s not what we see at all,” said the official. “There seems to be something about that model that seems odd. The race has tightened the way that we thought it would tighten, but we do not see anything that would suggest [the new tracking poll] is right.” Democrats also dispute the findings of several polls since Friday that the letter from the FBI director, James Comey, saying his staff were examining emails that may be related to the previous investigation into Clinton’s private email server has had a negative marginal affect on voter enthusiasm for the Democratic candidate. “We do not see any evidence that the Comey story has had an impact,” said the aide. “We’ve seen anecdotal evidence about turnout and our voter registering, volunteer numbers, etc, that suggests that if anything it has encouraged our supporters.”\\nClinton is not expected to address the email question again on Tuesday during her three scheduled events in Florida, but aides defended her decision to begin two speeches in Ohio on Monday raising the issue. “Obviously it is something that has got a lot of attention in the last few days, so we did think it was important for her to address.” Instead, the focus in Florida is expected to be on reminding voters how much is at stake in next week’s election. “There is no state that is more important and we think it is a state that she will win and Donald Trump has to win,” said the aide. “If she wins Florida, that … will put her over the top.”\\nVoters should also brace for a deluge of new advertising nationwide, however, as the Clinton campaign spends its remaining money on television commercials across the US. “You’ll see us back on the air in a lot of states over the last week or so,” said the aide, who agreed only to speak anonymously to reporters on the plane. “We’ve been able to raise a lot of money and it’s the last week to spend it. So you’ll see us spending in a lot of states where we haven’t.” Donald Trump, in a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, renewed his attacks on Clinton over the email investigation. He warned the crowd of thousands that if his rival were elected “it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis and the work of government would grind to an unbelievable, unglorious [sic] halt.” He also reminded Clinton voters in the Badger State that they can change their ballots if they have already voted absentee and now feel “a bad case of buyer’s remorse.” The event carried all the trappings of a normal presidential rally as Republican elected officials like Senator Ron Johnson, facing an uphill fight for re-election, and Governor Scott Walker appeared with their party’s nominee. It marked the first time that Johnson who is considered an underdog in his Senate bid against former Senator Russ Feingold appeared at an event with Trump. The Republican nominee also unveiled his closing ad on Tuesday entitled Choice. It cast the election as referendum between staying “on the road to stagnation” with Clinton, or getting “the change we’re waiting for” with Trump.', 'Donald Trump’s inauguration is quickly approaching as he prepares to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Thousands will flock to the Capitol to watch the events in person – or participate in protests against them. Thursday 19 January Inauguration events begin on Thursday, with a wreath-laying ceremony featuring the president-elect at Arlington National Cemetery scheduled for 3.30pm before “Welcome Celebrations” at the Lincoln Memorial, billed as the “official kick-off to the inaugural events”, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee website.\\nThe welcome celebrations will have two components. “Voices of the people”, featuring groups who applied to take part in the inauguration, will begin at 10.35am. It will be followed by the “Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration”, which will be televised live and last from 4pm to 6pm. According to a release, the latter celebration will feature “historic remarks” from Trump, as well as “special appearances” – ending the president-elect’s apparent struggle to lure any major names to his events. The leading country artist Toby Keith and southern rock band 3 Doors Down will perform. Numerous unofficial galas and balls will take place, both celebrating Trump and saying goodbye to Obama (though attendees be warned: you may have trouble finding a “great dress” to wear if you haven’t bought one already, the president-elect told the New York Times). Some are planned for inauguration eve. The country band Big & Rich will perform at the Great America Alliance Inaugural Gala, Rolling Stone reported. The DeploraBall will include an event on Thursday at the National Press Club as well as a gala event on Friday at the William F Bolger Center in Potomac, Maryland. At the Garden State Presidential Inaugural Gala, hosted by the New Jersey State Society, the B Street Band, a Bruce Springsteen tribute band, was slated to play – but they’ve since bowed out of the event. Peace Ball, organized by Busboys and Poets, will be held at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and “What To DO When You’re Expecting The WORST”, hosted by Jezebel and Fusion, at the Josephine Butler Parks Center, according to the Washington Post. On Facebook, more than 40,000 people have said they will attend a “Thanks, Obama” event on his last day in office. The original idea was for attendees to gather outside the White House and clap to show their appreciation for the outgoing president, but because of inauguration logistics, the event has moved to a private venue in the district, DCist reported.\\nAlso on Thursday evening: Common, the National, and others will perform at “Show Up!”, an event supporting Planned Parenthood. Friday 20 January Trump will began the big day by having coffee with Barack Obama. Then he will go to a service at St John’s church, according to NBC Washington. Ahead of the swearing-in, security screening gates will open to the public at 6am. Ticket holders will enter one of six areas, depending on the color of their ticket, according to the joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies (JCCIC). Caution: selfie sticks are prohibited (and a bunch of other items too).\\nAt the swearing-in ceremony on the west side of the US Capitol, the United States Marine Band will play first, according to the inauguration program. The ceremony will begin at 11.30am, with readings by faith leaders and remarks from the Missouri senator Roy Blunt, chairman of the JCCIC. The Missouri State University Chorale will play before Mike Pence takes the oath of office, followed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Trump will be sworn in around noon, with the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, followed by Trump’s inaugural address and additional readings. Jackie Evancho, 16, who rose to fame on the TV show America’s Got Talent, will sing the national anthem. A few notable, anticipated attendees include Rosalynn Carter, Jimmy Carter, Laura Bush, George W Bush, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton. The JCCIC has planned the traditional inaugural luncheon, to take place in National Statuary Hall at the Capitol. Four years ago, Obama and guests dined on steamed lobster and hickory grilled bison. The menu for this year’s luncheon includes Maine Lobster and Gulf Shrimp, Seven Hills Angus Beef, and chocolate soufflé and cherry vanilla ice cream for dessert. The inaugural parade will take place following the swearing-in ceremony. There has been some controversy over a few of the groups slated to perform, including the marching band from Talladega College, a historically black college in Alabama, and the Marist College Band, from Poughkeepsie, New York. Additional college and high school bands and other groups from around the country will participate, as well as national groups such as the Boy Scouts of America, Wounded Warrior Project, and representatives from each military branch, to name a few. The Trumps and Pences will attend three official inaugural balls, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee. Two, titled “Liberty and Freedom: The Official Presidential Inaugural Balls”, will be held at the Walter E Washington Convention Center, with Sam Moore, the Piano Guys and the Rockettes listed among the performers. The Salute To Our Armed Services Ball will take place at the National Building Museum.\\nUnofficial events are also planned for Friday evening. The Creative Coalition has hosted a bipartisan inauguration night gala fundraiser for the past 20 years, and this year is no different. It lists a number of celebrity hosts, including the actors Tim Daly, John Leguizamo and Christina Hendricks. The Great Gatsby Presidential Inaugural Ball, hosted by Dardanella, a party company, will take place at the National Portrait Gallery. Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington will host its Pink Ball at the Carol Whitehill Moses Center, and the the Anti-Inauguration will take place at the Lincoln Theatre, according to the Washington Post.\\nThe Answer (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition is planning a protest for 7am on the 20th, to be held at Freedom Plaza in Washington DC. #DisruptJ20 says it will hold a few events on the 20th, including a Festival of Resistance, which will march from Union Station to McPherson Square; other protests are also planned. Saturday 21 January At Washington’s national cathedral, an interfaith prayer service will be held. The Women’s March on Washington will take place on Saturday, with numerous “sister marches” held around the country and around the world. More than 200,000 people are expected to participate in the mass demonstration the day after Trump’s inauguration. The event in Washington will start at 10am at the intersection of Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the US Capitol. March organizers announced a lengthy list of speakers for the event including: Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America; television host Janet Mock; Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council; activist Angela Davis; actors America Ferrera and Scarlett Johansson; and many, many more. There will also be performances by Janelle Monae and Maxwell, among others. That evening, the Anti-Ball, a benefit concert for Planned Parenthood, will occur at the Black Cat.', 'A former Miss Universe has defended Donald Trump after a video surfaced showing him “getting even” with her – making lewd remarks and then pulling her in for a kiss – in front of a large audience at a Sydney event. Jennifer Hawkins, an Australian model and media personality, won the Miss Universe competition in 2004. The video, published by the Huffington Post on Saturday, was filmed at the National Achievers Congress at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in September 2011 and shows Trump seeking to embarrass Hawkins on stage. The three-minute clip begins with Trump telling the audience of thousands that he believes in “getting even with people”. “If they screw you, screw them back 10 times harder,” he says. “And I’ll give you an example: Jennifer Hawkins.” A fuller clip of the same event posted to YouTube shows this takes place some time after Hawkins had introduced the “brilliant businessman” to the stage. Trump singles her out in the audience and calls her to rejoin him on stage. “First of all, how beautiful is Jennifer? “Now this is about getting even. I was so angry at her yesterday.” Trump goes on to say that he thought that “my Jennifer” had “dissed” him by refusing to introduce him. “I’m going around saying she’s my favourite Miss Universe – though I think I like the new one better, Jennifer – I go around saying she’s the greatest, she writes books ... she’s fantastic. “Then when I came here, there was no Jennifer Hawkins to introduce me.”\\nHawkins, now back at the podium with Trump, interjects to say that “there was a miscommunication” and “of course I wanted to come here”. Trump tells the laughing audience that he was intending to tell them that Hawkins “is a beautiful girl on the outside but she’s not very bright”. “It wouldn’t have been true, but I would have said it anyway. ... “She’s so great and she did so well and she’s a big star here and I helped her make it. I won the Miss Universe pageant. And I heard that she wouldn’t introduce me.” Hawkins attempts to interject, before Trump goes onto make a lewd double entendre on the fact Hawkins “came” to the event, repeating the word several times. “See, they have the same filthy minds in Australia,” Trump says, to laughter and applause. An audience member can be seen leaving his seat. He concludes his anecdote: “She got in that car and she got her ass over here and I love her.” As Hawkins, apparently embarrassed, again cites a miscommunication with her management, Trump says: “I don’t know too many women that are taller than me,” then grabs her by the waist and kisses her on the cheek as she puts up her forearm in between them. “Can I sit down now?” she says. “You’ve embarrassed me – thank you very much.” The Huffington Post said it showed Trump “sexually humiliating” Hawkins before a large audience. But Hawkins told Australian media on Saturday that she had a “lot of respect” for Trump. “Sure, I’ve seen what’s been going on in the news, but really what is there for me to say other than that he respected me during that time in my life and I have a lot of respect for him because of that ... that’s really all I have to say about it,” she said, according to Fairfax Media’s report. She did not want to comment on Trump’s political chances. “That’s not saying I agree with everything that’s been happening ... but I am not going to sit here and throw negative comments out there, it’s just not who I am. I don’t like drama in my life so I try to stay away from that.” She also denied allegations that she had been cancelling interviews in recent weeks to avoid commenting on Trump and the controversy swirling around him. “It’s not that I’ve been avoiding the subject.” Hawkins made the comments at the Birdcage hospitality area at the Derby Day race in Melbourne on Saturday where she was acting as Myer ambassador. Her representative at 22 MGMT in Sydney has been contacted for comment. On Friday a former Miss Finland became the 12th woman to openly accuse Trump of sexual assault.', 'Even when silent, you sound loud. You are, in fact, an avalanche of contradictions: real and unreal, scary yet amusing, fact and fiction rolled into one – like a little rubber Mount Rushmore blown up to actual size by the use of helium. You confuse us. We want to laugh at your stumbles, but are petrified by what those stumbles may lead to. You are the worst person ever; and yet not as bad as Mike Pence. But you do have a definite sense of purpose. While Hillary Clinton hedged and played the game, you said it straight. You’ve been very clear: deport, build, repeal, replace. Everywhere you go, you shatter ossified politics. You slice through frozen convention like an icebreaker: set on a steady forward direction, leaving a stinking slick of oil and dead fish parts in its wake. It was worth it, though, because of where you are now. This is the best moment, isn’t it? Just as you’ve taken the oath of office, but still not worn down by that office. Frozen in your moment of history. All those doubters, the mewling enemies and haters, are silenced now: you are the 45th president of the US. That’s a fact. It’s true. They used to tease you about your attitude to the truth, didn’t they? All your post-reality fictoid-facts, like how global warming was a myth invented by the Chinese, how you respected all women without exception, except the greedy, grasping, ugly ones who were trying to suck you dry, how Obama wasn’t born in America, and also how you put everyone right when you said he was. And that rigged election: you had evidence the election was rigged against you and you were going to lose, and then, when you won it fair and square, you had proof you would have won it even more fairly and squarely had it not been rigged against you so you couldn’t win so bigly. And now they say the Russians rigged the election, and you say the election wasn’t rigged, it was never rigged, and you’ve been saying for months: it was never rigged.\\nYes, you were mocked nightly by damp-souled liberals who joked you couldn’t tell fact from fantasy. Well, guess what? If you now tweeted, “I am the 45th president of the United States”, not a single person would doubt you. Because it’s true. You’re the president. Fact! No scientist, no economist, no so-called expert can call you out. You are literally the most important man on Earth, in the solar system, maybe even the galaxy. Right now, everything in the universe revolves around you. But then comes the hard bit. The bit after this week. The rest of the presidency. That’s the bit others say can’t be controlled. Something will go wrong. Some screwball no-mark in some pointless department will answer a letter to an elector, and end up saying the wrong thing about China, or single moms, or car manufacturers, or dyslexia, thinking that they’re echoing your opinion. Then your enemies will report it, and then people will think it came from you. Then your press secretary will deny that’s what you meant and blame the no-mark, and name her. Then the no-mark will complain about sexism or bullying or some such artificial crime. Then you’ll act big, go against expectations, and apologise to that person. Then some other people, your enemies, will imply you’re a pussy. Your staff who attacked her and defended you, will express annoyance that you are contradicting what they’re saying. Then the person you apologised to, well, she’ll get arrogant and say how upset she was by what happened, and then you’ll have to tweet what she was really like when you met her, how annoying she was, how she’s just looking for a bigger job and a TV contract, and how you’re going to ask Congress to look into that department she works for and find out what’s going on. But, even then, it won’t go away, and there’ll be maybe a hundred other little, stupid stories like that which will never leave you alone, all because other people are fools and losers. And so one night, you’ll tweet something bad about China and single moms and car manufacturers and dyslexics, all in one tweet, and the whole cycle will start all over again, and take up so much time, it’ll look like that wall will never get built. And so, for the next four years, you’ll try to do stuff. With luck, the next eight years. (If your plan comes right, the next 12, even 16 years, too.) But this crap will keep coming up, won’t it? This not-smart, so-overrated nonsense from the false media, determined to undermine you. They’ll say you’re mishandling foreign affairs, causing conflict and hardship, arousing enmity, bitterness and division. It’s all designed to make people not like you, isn’t it? But you can get round that. You will tell people, again and again, that they do like you. That everything else they’ve heard isn’t true. And it will work. It always works.\\nYou will explain that the things that come from your mouth are not necessarily the things that come from your heart. You will remind people that things are true not when they are real but when you believe them. You will urge the media to concentrate on covering people’s fears and feelings, rather than the dull objects and information that clutter up their potentially beautiful lives. Why don’t crime reporters report that people feel a bit funny about Mexicans? Why don’t economists measure how freaked out people are about what might happen to their jobs one day, especially if your enemies were in charge? Why don’t the weather people point out, at the end of the show, just how everyone is feeling so much better because of the work you’re doing, and how that’s making them cope with whatever rain or cloud comes their way? Why don’t newscasters show the graphs that prove that anyone who fires a gun in America might well be a Muslim? Of course, the liberal media will have fun, won’t they, doing their little crazy skits about how there’s no need for reporters any more because we just have to say whatever it is we think sounds true. “Over now to our Chief-Bad-Feeling-About-China correspondent”; “We join our crime correspondent live outside the home of a suspicious couple new to the neighbourhood who keep themselves to themselves”; “And that’s all we’ve got time for. Join us tomorrow night at seven for another edition of What The Hell’s Going On?” Unfunny. You haven’t seen these skits (they haven’t been written), but they’re just so lame, aren’t they? No, how you govern will be so special, and so different from that pathetic portrayal. You’re going to bring into your administration a whole heap of talented people who will oversee a climate change in the way facts are considered. You will bring in financial experts who will reassure everyone that, no matter what the markets say, everyone is, in fact, fine. You will bring in law experts who will prove categorically that anyone who feels their civil liberties are being infringed are themselves infringing the civil liberties of the vast majority who voted to change them. And, above all, you will persuade everyone, especially those who tell you that you polled nearly three million votes fewer than Hillary, that you do have a mandate – since you believe you do, and it feels like the vast majority of people believe you do, too. And that’s evidence no money can buy. That’s how you will govern. Properly, effectively. Why, if the economy goes bad, or promised laws aren’t passed, or a war breaks out, why spend time and money and precious energy dealing with those things? Isn’t it more efficient to persuade people that they aren’t happening? Think what money that would save, putting dollars back in the pocket of every American. You will do a deal with the American people, a great big beautiful deal, the ultimate deal, and they will absolutely love it. What you’ve done is started a revolution, a movement. You’ve taught people to believe not what is empirically true but what is emotionally true, which is a better truth. You’ve set free the credulity of the people. So here is another undeniable fact. Soon the consequences of what you are doing will spread throughout the world. And, once done, they can’t be undone. Yes, you will be remembered for a very, very long time. Fact.', 'The decision by the Times to task a Conservative MP and Brexit campaigner with the UK’s first post-election interview with Donald Trump may have drawn criticism in Britain, but Michael Gove’s German co-interviewer is also a controversial figure. Since joining Axel Springer, Germany’s biggest publishing house, as a trainee in 1985, Kai Diekmann has been one of the most powerful – and colourful – operators in media and politics. In particular, his close links to conservative politicians have often made him a bête noire for the German left. After working in various editorial roles for Axel Springer’s two flagship publications – the world’s bestselling printed newspaper outside Asia, Bild; and the more upmarket broadsheet Die Welt – Diekmann took over as Bild’s editor in 2001, eventually moving on to become publisher of the Bild group. Diekmann’s fans insist he managed to wrench the right-leaning tabloid into the political centre – directing its ire as much at rightwing populists of the Pegida protest movement and the AfD as at its old enemies among the Green party and the 1968 student movement, though his critics continued to find problems in his close ties to conservative politicians. Former German chancellor Helmut Kohl was one of the best men at Diekmann’s wedding to columnist Katja Kessler in 2002; in turn, the newspaper editor was one of the best men at Kohl’s second marriage six years later. The offices of Taz newspaper are adorned with a mural containing a caricature of a naked Diekmann, with his penis stretching all the way to the building’s fifth floor – fallout from when the Bild editor sued the leftwing paper over a satirical column. In the autumn of 2012 Diekmann moved to Silicon Valley for almost a year to explore the digital media economy, ditching his prim look for a hipster beard. On Monday, German media speculated that his connections to Californian entrepreneurs may have played a part in securing his interview with Trump. A spokesperson for Axel Springer would only confirm that Diekmann had organised the interview in person. In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the 52-year-old said “for me it has in the last 16 years always been important that I arrange and conduct interviews in person”. The journalist’s scoop comes as he is due to depart from the publication that made his name. In a tweet, Diekmann described the Trump interview as his “leaving present”. On 6 January it emerged that a court was investigating Diekmann over the alleged sexual harassment of a Bild employee, though the company insisted his departure was unconnected to the incident. Diekmann told Frankfurter Allgemeine that the conversation with Trump had been “the most unusual interview” of his career. “Because the answers were not polished out of a washing machine, after tons of communication advisers had scrutinised them.” “After talking for an hour,” Diekmann said, “you got the impression that Trump views the United States at heart as a big business which isn’t working so well anymore and is only producing bad figures. He’s the new CEO who has to fix things.”', 'Donald Trump is a man of many amazing boasts; someone who never met a hyperbole he didn’t like. The truth can be a hazy thing in business, real estate and even taxes. But golf is supposed to be different. Golf lives in absolutes, and is governed by a strict honor code that players rigidly follow. Or at least they should. And so it is in golf, as most everything else with Trump, where the line between fact and fiction is hazy. Trump has bragged about having a handicap of three. For years, this number was accepted with little public question, probably because nobody cared enough to investigate it. Forbes once reported his handicap as four, with the caveat that he has yet to produce a signed scorecard as proof. But mostly Trump’s word was that. The Republican presidential nominee lists his handicap as 2.8 on the US Golf Association’s Golf Handicap and Information Network, making him an extraordinary golfer at any age – but truly phenomenal for someone who is 70. And it raises the question: how likely is this claim to be truthful? Is it yet another story of virility fabricated by a man who has a long history of distorting reality?\\nTrump’s age should not be an impediment. Jim Cowan, the director of course rating and handicapping for the Northern California Golf Association in Pebble Beach, said in an email that the organization runs many events for senior golfers over 65 and “handicaps of three and under and not uncommon”. Terrence Somerville, the assistant pro at Washington DC’s Langston Golf Course, located two miles from the US Capitol building where Trump will take the oath of office if elected, agrees. In fact, he says, there are 70-year-old golfers who show up at Langston with legitimate three handicaps. There is a hitch, though. “With someone who has a schedule like Donald Trump’s, it’s unlikely,” Somerville said. “That’s almost scratch, someone who can play almost professionally. It’s not somebody who has a schedule like his.” The 70-year-olds who come through the clubhouse with three handicaps are usually retired. “They aren’t in and out of meetings,” Somerville said. And they are also men who have been playing their entire lives, probably starting as teenagers and who either played in college or somehow found a way to play nearly every day through adulthood. “It’s very remote that someone could do this with the schedule he has,” Somerville added. There are many tales of Trump bending the rules on the golf course. Last year, former Sports Illustrated managing editor Mark Mulvoy told the Washington Post that once playing with Trump in the 1990s he realized that Trump had placed a ball just feet from the pin that he had never hit. “Ahh, the guys I play with cheat all the time,” Mulvoy said Trump told him. “I have to cheat to keep up with them.”\\nThe same story referenced an interview Alice Cooper did in 2012 in which the rock star – a regular golfer – answered a question about the worst golf cheat he had ever played with by saying: “I played with Donald Trump one time, that’s all I’m going to say.” Trump wouldn’t be the first politician to massage the truth of his athletic prowess. Bill Clinton’s propensity for taking mulligans, golfing parlance for do-overs, which are not strictly permitted under the rules, is well documented. Runner’s World came away with one of the scoops of the 2012 election cycle when it caught Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan shaving more than an hour off his marathon time. When former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il played the first ever round of golf on the 7,700-yard championship course at Pyongyang in October 1994, state media reported that the Dear Leader finished with an 18-hole score of 34, including no less than five holes-in-one. That said, Trump clearly has some talent as a golfer, as seen in this 2011 YouTube video. But his claim of a three handicap is hard to quantify, especially when his 20 most recent scores on his GHIN index are mostly from 2014 and stretch back to 2009. Even assuming he did not include his best rounds, it’s not the kind of record you would see from a 70-year-old with a reputation as a scratch golfer. And it might just be yet another golf story.', 'President Donald Trump has set out a bleak portrayal of a nation under siege, vowing to end “American carnage” in an inaugural address that fired up his supporters but did little to ease the fears of American liberals or an anxious world.\\nMoments after being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, Trump described a country in crisis and pledged an isolationist and protectionist cure, declaring: “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first.” Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton looked stone-faced during the speech, while George W Bush at times appeared uncomfortable. But there were cheers from Trump’s supporters on a rainy National Mall in Washington. The crowd was largely white and notably smaller than for many past inaugurations. Under the dome of the US Capitol, the billionaire businessman hailed the “historic movement” that swept him to a shock victory over Hillary Clinton in last November’s presidential election, claiming it was unique in world history. Citizens expect great education, safe neighbourhoods and good jobs, the 70-year-old continued. “But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” It was a grim account of the most prosperous nation on earth from a man denounced by critics as an authoritarian populist. Trump’s aides had indicated that one of his inspirations for the speech was John F Kennedy’s inaugural address in 1961. But there were closer echoes of a 1968 speech by Richard Nixon that described “cities enveloped in smoke and flame” and hearing “millions of Americans cry out in anguish”.\\nAs America’s political elite looked on, Trump went on to blame past US governments for favouring other nations at the American people’s own expense, from the military to infrastructure to factories. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own,” he said. “But that is the past. And now, we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first.” For some, the phrase “America first” has disquieting associations with a 1940s movement that aimed to keep America out of the second world war and came to be accused of antisemitism. But on Friday the crowd, many wearing “make America great again” baseball caps and other regalia, applauded and cheered. Trump continued: “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.” Breaking with Republican orthodoxy, Trump promised a massive infrastructure building programme including roads, bridges, airports and tunnels, potentially creating thousands of jobs and costing billions of dollars. “We will follow two simple rules; buy American and hire American.”\\nTrump’s longshot candidacy has proved uniquely divisive ever since he launched it in June 2015 by denouncing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. He also proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and earned the support of white nationalists. His speech is unlikely to have assuaged the concerns of progressive activists who intend to march in protest on Saturday. “At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other,” Trump said. “When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. “The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.” Trump had said in advance he hoped to emulate Ronald Reagan’s 1981 inaugural address. And there were clear echoes in his blunt 16-minute address of Reagan’s creed that government is not the solution but rather the problem. “Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people,” Trump said. “For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. “The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. “That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment, it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.\\n“What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.” Trump lost no time in sitting down at the US Capitol to sign a waiver for his defence secretary nominee, James Mattis, as well as documents for his other cabinet nominations and a proclamation for a national day of patriotism. There was some light banter with leading Democrats over pens. The physical transfer of power was mirrored online. A “top issues” section of the White House website moved priorities of the Obama administration – including civil rights, climate change and the Iran nuclear deal – to an archival website and replaced them with headings such as “America first energy plan”, “America first foreign policy,” “Bringing back jobs and growth” and “Making our military strong again”. Additional reporting by Tom McCarthy', 'Make America Wait Again. That is what Donald Trump’s energy policy amounts to. Stop all the clocks, put the technological revolution on hold, ensure that the transition from fossil fuels to clean power is delayed for as long as possible. Trump is the president that corporate luddites have dreamed of: the man who will let them squeeze every last cent from their oil and coal reserves before they become worthless. They need him because science, technology and people’s demands for a safe and stable world have left them stranded. There is no fair fight that they can win, so their last hope lies with a government that will rig the competition.\\nTo this end, Trump has appointed to his cabinet some of those responsible for a universal crime: inflicted not on particular nations or groups, but on everyone.\\nRecent research suggests that – if drastic action of the kind envisaged by the Paris agreement on climate change is not taken – ice loss in Antarctica alone could raise sea levels by a metre this century, and by 15 metres in subsequent centuries. Combine this with the melting in Greenland and the thermal expansion of sea water, and you discover that many of the world’s great cities are at existential risk. The climatic disruption of crucial agricultural zones – in North and Central America, the Middle East, Africa and much of Asia – presents a security threat that could dwarf all others. The civil war in Syria, unless resolute policies are adopted, looks like a glimpse of a possible global future. These are not, if the risks materialise, shifts to which we can adapt. These crises will be bigger than our capacity to respond to them. They could lead to the rapid and radical simplification of society, which means, to put it brutally, the end of civilisations and many of the people they support. If this happens, it will amount to the greatest crime ever committed. And members of Trump’s proposed cabinet are among the leading perpetrators. In their careers so far, they have championed the fossil fuel industry while contesting the measures intended to prevent climate breakdown. They appear to have considered the need of a few exceedingly rich people to protect their foolish investments for a few more years, weighed it against the benign climatic conditions that have allowed humanity to flourish, and decided that the foolish investments are more important.\\nBy appointing Rex Tillerson, chief executive of the oil company ExxonMobil, as secretary of state, Trump not only assures the fossil economy that it sits next to his heart, he also provides comfort to another supporter: Vladimir Putin. It was Tillerson who brokered the $500bn (£407bn) deal between Exxon and the state-owned Russian company Rosneft to exploit oil reserves in the Arctic. As a result he was presented with the Russian Order of Friendship by Putin. The deal was stopped under the sanctions the US imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. The probability of these sanctions in their current form surviving a Trump government is, to the nearest decimal place, a snowball’s chance in hell. If Russia did interfere in the US election, it will be handsomely rewarded when the deal goes ahead. Trump’s nominations for energy secretary and interior secretary are both climate change deniers, who – quite coincidentally – have a long history of sponsorship by the fossil fuel industry. His proposed attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, allegedly failed to disclose in his declaration of interests that he leases land to an oil company. The man nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, has spent much of his working life campaigning against … the Environmental Protection Agency. As the attorney general in Oklahoma, he launched 14 lawsuits against the EPA, seeking, among other aims, to strike down its Clean Power Plan, its limits on the mercury and other heavy metals released by coal plants and its protection of drinking water supplies and wildlife. Thirteen of these suits were said to include as co-parties companies that had contributed to his campaign funds or to political campaign committees affiliated to him.\\nTrump’s appointments reflect what I call the Pollution Paradox. The more polluting a company is, the more money it must spend on politics to ensure it is not regulated out of existence. Campaign finance therefore comes to be dominated by dirty companies, ensuring that they wield the greatest influence, crowding out their cleaner rivals. Trump’s cabinet is stuffed with people who owe their political careers to filth. It was once possible to argue, rightly or wrongly, that the human benefits of developing fossil fuel reserves might outweigh the harm. But a combination of more refined climate science, which now presents the risks in stark terms, and the plummeting costs of clean technologies renders this argument as obsolete as a coal-fired power station. As the US burrows into the past, China is investing massively in renewable energy, electric cars and new battery technologies. The Chinese government claims that this new industrial revolution will generate 13m jobs. This, by contrast to Trump’s promise to create millions of jobs through reanimating coal, at least has a chance of materialising. It is not just that returning to an old technology when better ones are available is difficult; it is also that coal mining has been automated to the extent that it now supports few jobs. Trump’s attempt to revive the fossil era will serve no one but the coal barons. Understandably, commentators have been seeking glimpses of light in Trump’s position. But there are none. He could not have made it clearer, through his public statements, the Republican platform and his appointments, that he intends to the greatest extent possible to shut down funding for both climate science and clean energy, rip up the Paris agreement, sustain fossil fuel subsidies and annul the laws that protect people and the rest of the world from the impacts of dirty energy. His candidacy was represented as an insurgency, challenging established power. But his position on climate change reveals what should have been obvious from the beginning: he and his team represent the incumbents, fighting off insurgent technologies and political challenges to moribund business models. They will hold back the tide of change for as long as they can. And then the barrier will burst. Twitter: @GeorgeMonbiot. A fully linked version of this column will be published at monbiot.com', 'Donald Trump has settled fraud lawsuits relating to Trump University for $25m, removing a legal headache despite having pledged to fight the cases to the bitter end.\\nLawyers for the president-elect settled the three lawsuits on Friday, averting the prospect of him testifying in a courtroom showdown which threatened to reveal more troubling details about the now defunct real estate course. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, claimed vindication and victory for those “swindled” by the course. “Donald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university,” Schneiderman said in a statement. “Today, that all changes. Today’s $25m settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.” Every victim will receive restitution and the president-elect will pay up to $1m in penalties to the state of New York for violating state education laws, Schneiderman said. “The victims of Trump University have waited years for today’s result and I am pleased that their patience – and persistence – will be rewarded by this $25m settlement.”\\nTrump’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the deal the president-elect will reportedly not admit to any wrongdoing. Former students who filed the suit said they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trump’s real estate investing “secrets” from his “hand-picked” instructors. The casino owner-turned-Republican candidate denied the allegations and said he relied on others to manage the business. Trump’s lawyers negotiated the settlement with Schneiderman, in New York, and law firms that brought two separate class action lawsuits regarding Trump University in California. Of the $25m some $21m will help reimburse those involved in the California suits. Some $3m will go to those in New York not covered by the California lawsuits. Trump catapulted the case into the election this summer by assailing Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the federal district court judge hearing the case. Trump called him a “hater”, a “total disgrace” and “biased”. “He is not doing the right thing … [He] happens to be, we believe, Mexican,” he told a rally in San Diego. For a White House hopeful to attack a federal judge in such a way was unprecedented. And inaccurate. Curiel has Mexican heritage but is a US citizen born in Indiana. GOP primary opponents, and later Hillary Clinton, used the lawsuits to bash Trump as a huckster. Stung, he vowed in tweets, speeches and interviews to not settle. “I don’t settle lawsuits,” he told a rally in Arkansas. “Probably should have settled it, but I just can’t do that. Mentally I can’t do it. I’d rather spend a lot more money and fight it.”\\nHowever, his unexpected election victory put pressure on the president-elect, who is busy forming a cabinet, to end the distraction before his inauguration in January – and before the possible emergence of further damaging revelations. The opening of 400 pages of the Trump University “playbook” to public scrutiny in June shone a light on the ruthless business practices the real estate mogul used to build his business empire. Employees were told to get people to pile on credit card debt and to target their financial weaknesses in an attempt to sell them the high-priced real estate courses, especially the $34,995 Gold Elite three-day package. The documents contained an undated “personal message” from Trump to new enrollees at the school: “Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.” Staff were told to spend lunch breaks in sign-up seminars “planting seeds” in potential students’ minds about how their lives would not improve unless they joined the program. Staff were also told to ask them personal questions to discover weaknesses that could be exploited to help seal the deal. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said the settlement appeared to be a substantial victory for the plaintiffs. “Especially because Trump suggested that he never settled cases and derided others who did settle them.” The looming move to the White House ratcheted up pressure, Tobias said. “It was not inevitable, but it would have been very difficult to create a new government and conduct this litigation, particularly if Trump had to testify. Merely postponing it until he was president would not have helped much as the job will consume him.” In an unrelated case, Trump’s lawyers on Wednesday dropped a lawsuit he was pursuing in Florida about commercial air traffic over his Mar-a-Lago estate.', 'The worst thing that ever could happen happened after the worst thing that ever could happen happened after the worst thing that ever could happen happened. Carlton Douglas Ridenhour, AKA Chuck D So after a miserable couple of weeks for everyone who gives a damn about peace, love and understanding, and with more bad news shortly on the way from Baton Rouge, the word came down in Cleveland: no tennis balls. For the sake of public safety and national security, no tennis balls would be allowed in the cordon sanitaire around the Quicken Loans Arena, site of the Republican national convention, nor would water guns, toy guns, knives, rope, tape, umbrellas with metal tips, light bulbs, gas masks or several dozen other items. Guns, however, were authorized. Guns were OK, a pronouncement that was quickly taken up by groups as divergent in their orientations as Bikers For Trump and the New Black Panthers, among others.\\nBarely a week after five police officers were shot dead in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter march, Cleveland was duty-bound to follow Ohio’s open-carry statute. “Our intent is to follow the law,” said a stiff-lipped mayor Frank G Jackson. “And the law says you can have open carry, that’s what it says. Whether I agree with it or not is another issue.” Guns allowed, but no tennis balls. It’s the sort of garishly insane proposition that’s just another normal day in America, the kind of stunt that a bunch of latter-day Dadaists might pull to highlight societal derangement and degradation. Let the word go forth: America has lost its mind! Or maybe dementia serves as a better metaphor, the country shuffling around like a bonkers senior citizen with a Depends on his head and Kleenex boxes for shoes. Walking down Euclid Avenue on the second day of the convention, along a raucous urban stretch of bars and tourist joints and overheated sidewalk peddlers pushing T-shirts and Trump-related campaign junk, I came upon a street preacher raging at the heathen through an amplifier rigged to his God-truck, an apocalypse on wheels decorated with photos of aborted fetuses, starving Africans, scrawl-painted Bible verses and similar visual aids. But that wasn’t God talking back at him from above, no, but a heavyset black woman leaning out her second-storey window bellowing “Preach love! Preach love! Preach love!” and “You don’t know nothin’ about being a woman in this world!” A debate between prophets, while right around the corner MSNBC was broadcasting live from a mobile studio, political blather booming up and down Fourth Street.\\nWhat is it about America, where every public happening becomes a carnival of the weird and surreal? Merciful shards of sanity occasionally cut through. When the Art of Rap concert in Dallas was cancelled in the wake of the police shootings, Chuck D, frontman for Public Enemy, had this to say for the Dallas Morning News: “It’s understandable,” said the man who wrote Fight the Power in 1989. “Those officers were out there securing a Black Lives Matter protest.” He paused. “There’s nothing can be said here. We have to let it rest for a while … To go in there Saturday? That would be inappropriate.” But America can’t shut up or slow down for a second, and so we rolled past Dallas, past black lives and blue lives and Baton Rouge on Sunday morning with three cops dead and three more wounded, this only days after more than 80 dead in France, bombings in Baghdad, Isis attacks in Bangladesh, and an attempted coup in Turkey with hundreds of casualties. Welcome to Cleveland! Where the Trump movement arrived on a rumbling tidal surge (nothing so crisp or cleansing as a tidal wave), a molasses-thick swash carrying all manner of bottom sludge, along with 37 primary and caucus wins, 1,543 delegates amassed, gazillions of dollars worth of “free media coverage”, and the shattered wreckage and random personal effects of what was once the GOP establishment. It all washed up on the shores of Lake Erie and backed into the channel of the Cuyahoga river that so famously burned in 1969, emblem of Rust Belt decline when Cleveland was the butt and punchline of a thousand jokes.\\nNobody laughs at Cleveland anymore. It has a spiff downtown, a happening hipster population, and royalty – and an NBA championship – to its name. King James lives here, James as in LeBron, and now another aspirant to a different sort of throne was squalling into town. Trump, one imagines, doesn’t really want to be president; only king will do, and it’s worth trying to picture the American Majesty’s style, the ne plus ultra piss-elegance of a Trump presidency with its slathers of gold-gilt and reflective glass, the aesthetic of, say, a 1970s mid-level mobster from Buffalo, with Real Housewives updates of high-tech and glitz. Richard Nixon, raised a Quaker, went hard for royal pomp, with the presidential seal stamped on everything from cufflinks to golf carts, and toy-soldier trumpeters to announce his entrance and exit. Nixon came within a whisker of madness – is imperial style a marker of mental instability? Safe to say Trump’s would not be a modest presidency. Norman Mailer, writing in 1968 of Nixon’s nomination in Miami and the Siege of Chicago, had this prophecy for the Republican party:\\nThey had been a damned minority for too long, a huge indigestible boulder in the voluminous ruminating gut of every cow-like Democratic administration, an insane Republican minority with vast powers of negation and control, a minority who ran the economy, and half the finances of the world, and all too much of the internal affairs of four or five continents, and the Pentagon, and the technology of the land, and most of the secret police, and nearly every policeman in every small town, and yet finally they did not run the land, they did not comprehend it, the country was loose from them, ahead of them, the life style of the country kept denying their effort, the lives of the best Americans kept accelerating out of their reach. They were the most powerful force in America, and yet they were a psychic island. If they did not find a bridge, they could only grow more insane each year, like a rich nobleman in an empty castle chasing elves and ogres with his stick. Mailer missed it by little: instead of an island we have a wall, the wall that’s as close to a defining principle as the Trump campaign has. In Cleveland it was hard to distinguish between the mob rhetoric on the streets and the official, presumably vetted verbiage one heard inside the Quicken Loans Arena. “Build that wall! Build that wall!” could break out anywhere, anytime, and jackboot chants of “Trump, Trump, Trump.” And Chris Christie’s Tuesday night speech to the convention – a sort of rump-court indictment of Hillary Clinton, the acting out of what is surely a pet fantasy of the governor, and an audition for the post of attorney general should a Trump administration come to pass – inspired gleeful outbursts of “Lock her up! Lock her up!”, the voices of the faithful loud, full-throated, blood-lusty, much as the Romans must have sounded as the lions were turned loose on representatives of some poor damned minority. The same spirit was on display Monday at an “America First Unity Rally” on the banks of the Cuyahoga, an event hosted by, among others, Citizens for Trump, Tea Partiers for Trump, Bikers for Trump, Christians for Trump, Women United for Trump, Vets for Trump, Millennials for Trump, Truckers for Trump … you get the idea. More than once this year I’ve heard the Trump phenomenon described as a peasants’ revolt. Well, here they were, and they were mightily pissed, their anger, however much of it was justified – and much was – matched by their evident inability to manage even the most basic vocabulary of American political life. The mistress of ceremonies, one Trish Cunningham, a blond, florid woman in a short coral-orange dress who was described as the “godmother of the Pennsylvania Tea Party”, seemed not to understand the difference between a state and US senator. The national anthem was grievously mangled, the soloist missing about every third word (“the rockets’ red flare”). One of the speakers, a former first sergeant in the marines and currently a New Hampshire state rep, insisted that this year the GOP would “take back the hill,” by which I think he meant, Capitol Hill? Congress? Where the Republicans currently hold majorities in both houses.\\nThere on the grassy slopes of Settler’s Landing Park I was informed by my fellow rally-goers that 9/11 was “false”, that Israel “arranged” Barack Obama’s election, that “we’ve got to take our country back” and that “the liberal media is portraying Trump as a racist for wanting to secure our borders, and it’s not right and totally unfair”. In other words: people know when they’re being screwed. They may not know exactly how or by whom or on which end, but sooner or later the signal makes its way up the spinal cord, and is eventually acted upon. For 30 years Republican voters have dutifully nominated every establishment favorite put before them, refusing the primal temptations of a Pat Buchanan, a Rick Santorum, a Michele Bachmann, but on Monday, the first afternoon of the convention, we watched as the last of the last-ditch anti-Trump efforts died a loud and sloppy death. That evening I wandered out for a walk, and taking a seat in Public Square I noted the massive police presence, a wild-eyed pilgrim dragging around an 8ft cross, two fake nuns on stilts advocating a sin tax on meat, and happy kids soaking themselves in surface level fountains. Nearby a sort of anarchist-improv group did a skit satirizing the Trump phenomenon, which ended with this ditty: If I can get you to fear, I can get you to hate, If I can get you to hate, You won’t think straight, If you don’t think straight, That’ll make you a chump, And then you’ll wind up with Trump. Well, there’s nothing new about that. Fear has been the driving force of the GOP since the start of the cold war – fear of Commies, fear of black people, fear of Mexicans, gay people, feminists, Muslims, terrorists, feds and so forth, the fear-mongering cultivated to a high art form in the years since 9/11. The difference this time around is economic. The Republican establishment told the base to do one thing, and the base, at long last, did the opposite. “Pluck the chicken but don’t make it scream,” a long-ago New World dictator once told his cronies, but in America in the year 2016, after 35 years of supply-side economics, wholesale globalization, and the biggest redistribution of wealth – not trickle down, but vacuum up – in history, the chicken is screaming. ••• “The Bush family – while we would love to have them – are part of the past,” Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager, declared at a morning press briefing during convention week. “We are dealing with the future.” But as it’s played out in the 13 months since Trump descended the escalator to announce his candidacy, “Make America Great Again” looks a lot like the idealized Wasp past whose realest incarnation was seated somewhere in Ronald Reagan’s brain, a social order designed to appeal nicely to white males of authoritarian inclination. And as for everyone else – women, “the negroes” and, ah, latins? – well, wasn’t it all very nice for them too?\\nHere’s some news: we don’t live in that world anymore. On Wednesday night Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan gave fine-sounding speeches extolling the GOP as the party of Lincoln, emancipation, and civil rights, when the fact of the matter is Republicans haven’t been that party since 1964. In July of that year, at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, the party chose as its presidential nominee Senator Barry Goldwater, who just a few short weeks before had voted loudly and proudly against the Civil Rights Act. The GOP has worked a sliding scale of racism ever since; for proof, one need only look to the long and twisted history of the Southern Strategy, or voting patterns of the past 50 years, or the coalition of state attorneys general who successfully sued to gut the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act. Trump’s genius, particularly suited to a time of financial stress for much of the working and middle class, lies in the way he’s mainstreamed the far end of that sliding scale, forcing blatantly racist propositions onto center stage. He was embraced early by neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and the like, and he embraced them back in the form of Mussolini quotes, retweets of white supremacists, and foot-dragging, nod-and-a-wink disavowals of support from David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan. Any doubts as to whether a critical mass of the Republican leadership would also embrace its nominee vaporized over the course of convention week, and by Thursday evening Trump could truthfully claim that the party was unified. Or unified enough to make the claim without being struck by lightning.\\nTwice in its history the United States has been forced to re-create itself, both times in the face of existential crises. The abolition of slavery was the first such re-creation, born out of the crisis of the civil war. The New Deal was the second, the formation of the modern welfare state in response to the crisis of the Great Depression; had Roosevelt acted any less radically, the profound unrest that in certain places had already flared into outright insurrection – an episode of US history that’s largely forgotten, or ignored – might well have morphed into re-creation by other means. Now we find ourselves in dire need of a third re-creation, a revolution in the psyche as well as the structure of the country that takes account of realities that are already upon us. A broadening beyond the psychic island, the insane castle, the encircling wall of the Wasp that Norman Mailer wrote about nearly a half-century ago. It has to happen; the country’s changing demographics, and the sheer weight of human experience they represent, demand it. The only way it won’t happen is by the outright subversion of democracy, which by definition would constitute a very different sort of re-creation. A few years ago I read Gabriel García Márquez’s autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale, and I recall being struck by his description of the political tensions in his native Colombia in the late 1940s, just prior to the outbreak of the country’s decades-long civil war. What seemed to begin as more or less professional hardline posturing by liberals and conservatives developed over time into something rawer, hotter, and, ultimately, intractable. I kept making the same note in the margins: US now. US now. US now. It’s worth praying to all the gods we have that it won’t come to that – that the third American re-creation will come by gentler means.', 'What is the worst thing about Donald Trump? The lies? The racist stereotypes? The misogyny? The alleged gropings? The apparent refusal to accept democratic outcomes? All these are bad enough. But they’re not the worst. The worst thing about Donald Trump is that he’s the man in the mirror. We love to horrify ourselves with his excesses, and to see him as a monstrous outlier, the polar opposite of everything a modern, civilised society represents. But he is nothing of the kind. He is the distillation of all that we have been induced to desire and admire. Trump is so repulsive not because he offends our civilisation’s most basic values, but because he embodies them. Trump personifies the traits promoted by the media and corporate worlds he affects to revile; the worlds that created him. He is the fetishisation of wealth, power and image in a nation where extrinsic values are championed throughout public discourse. His conspicuous consumption, self-amplification and towering (if fragile) ego are in tune with the dominant narratives of our age.\\nAs the recipient of vast inherited wealth who markets himself as solely responsible for his good fortune, he is the man of our times. The US Apprentice TV show which he hosted tells the story of everything he is not: the little guy dragging himself up from the bottom through enterprise and skill. None of this distinguishes him from the majority of the very rich, whose entrepreneurial image, loyally projected by the media, clashes with their histories of huge bequests, government assistance, monopolies and rent-seeking. If his politics differ from those of the rest of the modern Republican party, it is because he is, in some respects, more liberal. Every vice, for the Republican trailblazers such as Ted Cruz and Scott Walker, is now a virtue; every virtue a vice. Encouraged by the corporate media, the Republicans have been waging a full-spectrum assault on empathy, altruism and the decencies we owe to other people. Their gleeful stoving in of faces, their cackling destruction of political safeguards and democratic norms, their stomping on all that is generous and caring and cooperative in human nature, have turned the party into a game of Mortal Kombat scripted by Breitbart News. Did Trump invent the xenophobia and racism that infuse his campaign? Did he invent his conspiracy theories about stolen elections and the criminality of his opponents? No. They were there all along. What is new and different about him is that he has streamlined these narratives into a virulent demagoguery. But the opportunity has been building for years; all that was required was someone blunt and unscrupulous enough to take it.\\nNor can you single out Trump for ignoring, denying and deriding the key issues of our time, such as climate change. Almost all prominent Republicans have been at it. In fact, across the four presidential debates, not one question about climate change was asked. Even when politicians and journalists accept the science, it makes little difference if they avoid the subject like the plague. America’s fourth president, James Madison, envisaged the United States constitution as representation tempered by competition between factions. In the 10th federalist paper, written in 1787, he argued that large republics were better insulated from corruption than small, or “pure” democracies, as the greater number of citizens would make it “more difficult for unworthy candidates to practise with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried”. A large electorate would protect the system against oppressive interest groups. Politics practised on a grand scale would be more likely to select people of “enlightened views and virtuous sentiments”. Instead, the US – in common with many other nations – now suffers the worst of both worlds: a large electorate dominated by a tiny faction. Instead of republics being governed, as Madison feared, by “the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority”, they are beholden to the not-so-secret wishes of an unjust and interested minority. What Madison could not have foreseen was the extent to which unconstrained campaign finance and a sophisticated lobbying industry would come to dominate an entire nation, regardless of its size.\\nFor every representative, Republican or Democrat, who retains a trace element of independence, there are three sitting in the breast pocket of corporate capital. Since the supreme court decided that there should be no effective limits on campaign finance, and, to a lesser extent, long before, candidates have been reduced to tongue-tied automata, incapable of responding to those in need of help, incapable of regulating those in need of restraint, for fear of upsetting their funders. Democracy in the US is so corrupted by money that it is no longer recognisable as democracy. You can kick individual politicians out of office, but what do you do when the entire structure of politics is corrupt? Turn to the demagogue who rages into this political vacuum, denouncing the forces he exemplifies. The problem is not, as Trump claims, that the election will be stolen by ballot rigging. It is that the entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they get anywhere near casting their votes. When Trump claims that the little guy is being screwed by the system, he’s right. The only problem is that he is the system.\\nThe political constitution of the United States is not, as Madison envisaged, representation tempered by competition between factions. The true constitution is plutocracy tempered by scandal. In other words, all that impedes the absolute power of money is the occasional exposure of the excesses of the wealthy. What distinguishes Trump’s political career is that, until recently, his scandals have done him no harm. Trump disgusts us because, where others use a dog whistle, he uses a klaxon. We hate to hear his themes so clearly articulated. But we know in our hearts that they suffuse the way the world is run. Because this story did not begin with Trump, it will not end with Trump, however badly he may lose the election. Yes, he is a shallow, mendacious, boorish and extremely dangerous man. But those traits ensure that he is not an outsider but the perfect representation of his caste, the caste that runs the global economy and governs our politics. He is our system, stripped of its pretences.', 'A 10th woman accused Donald Trump of unwanted sexual contact on Thursday morning, just hours after the presidential candidate angrily renewed his denials of ever having inappropriate contact with women. Karena Virginia claims that Trump groped her breast and made sexual comments toward her at a random encounter outside the 1998 US Open tennis tournament in Flushing, Queens. Virginia was 27 at the time. The two had never previously met, she said. “I was waiting for a car to arrive to take me home,” she said, flanked by famous women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred, and facing a battery of clacking cameras. As she was waiting, she claimed, Trump approached her with a small group of other men. “I was surprised when I overheard him talking to the other men about me. He said: ‘Hey, look at this one, we haven’t seen her before. Look at those legs,’ as though I were an object rather than a person. “He then walked up to me and reached out his right arm and grabbed my right arm,” she continued. “Then his hand touched the right side of my breast. I was in shock. I flinched. ‘Don’t you know who I am? Don’t you know who I am?’ – that’s what he said to me. I felt intimidated and I felt powerless. When my car pulled up and I got in, after I closed the door, my shock turned to shame.” Virginia, who described herself on Thursday as a yoga instructor and life coach from the tri-state area, spoke in a midtown Manhattan hotel conference room just blocks away from Trump Tower. It was less than one week after Allred held a press conference with another Trump accuser. “Her allegations demonstrate how Mr Trump selects his victims at random,” Allred said. Within hours, the Trump campaign released an acid response, claiming Virginia’s press conference was the work of the Clinton campaign. “Discredited political operative Gloria Allred, in another coordinated, publicity-seeking attack with the Clinton campaign, will stop at nothing to smear Mr Trump,” said Jessica Ditto, the campaign’s deputy communications director. “Give me a break. Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories and the clear efforts to benefit Hillary Clinton.” On Thursday, Allred disclosed, not for the first time, that she is an avowed supported of Clinton and served as an elected delegate at this summer’s Democratic national convention. Allred denied that she had had contact with anyone inside the Clinton campaign regarding Virginia’s claims. Asked if Allred and Virginia could produce eyewitnesses of the event, Allred replied that Virginia had told her husband and several friends about the alleged encounter soon after it occurred.\\nVirginia is the 10th woman to publicly accuse Trump of inappropriate sexual contact – the seventh since a 2005 tape revealed Trump bragging that his fame allowed him to grope and kiss women without their consent. In the second presidential debate, just days after the tape was published by the Washington Post, Trump denied that he ever acted on his words. He dismissed it as “locker-room talk”. Several of his accusers have said his denials are what spurred them to go public. The tape and the accusers have roiled the presidential election in its critical final weeks. And it has sent some members of Trump’s party scrambling to create distance from the candidate. Trump, meanwhile, has vehemently denied the accusations. At a recent rally, he suggested the women accusing him were not attractive enough to draw his attention. “Look at her,” Trump said, referring to a People magazine reporter who claimed Trump had pushed her against a wall and kissed her. “I don’t think so.”\\nOn Wednesday night, in the final presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump suggested that the rush of accusations was either orchestrated by the Clinton campaign or the product of women seeking “10 minutes of fame”. He had previously called his accusers “horrible, horrible liars”. “Those stories are all totally false, I have to say that,” Trump said. “And I didn’t even apologize to my wife who is sitting right here because I didn’t do anything … Nobody has more respect for women than me.” Virginia on Thursday said she was motived to make her claims in public out of support for the other women whom Trump had called liars. “I have lost sleep over this,” said Virginia, holding down a sob. “I have been fearful about bringing unwanted attention to me and my loving family, which includes my husband, my daughter and my son. But in the end, I feel that it is my duty as a woman, a mother, a human being and an American citizen to speak out and tell the truth about what happened to me. “Mr Trump,” she continued, “your random moment of sexual pleasure came at my expense and affected me greatly.” Virginia described feeling shame about the alleged encounter and blaming herself for wearing a short dress and heels – an outfit she avoided for years afterwards “so as not to attract unwanted attention”. Virginia claimed that she met Trump one more time, about five years ago, at a business event. “He looked me up and down a few times in a lecherous manner. This time, mixed in with the feelings of shame, I felt disgust toward him. I had come to the realization that I was the victim and he had violated me.” “She has shown tremendous courage in coming forward today, especially in light of Mr Trump’s statements last night in which he called the allegations of the nine women who alleged inappropriate sexual conduct by him ‘lies and fiction’,” Allred said. “Mr Trump, you may have thought that you could violate women without consequences. But there are always consequences. There are consequences for the women that you have hurt and there are consequences for you as well.” Besides Virginia, nine other women have accused Trump, publicly and using their full names, of harassing them or touching them without their consent. A few, such as Jill Harth, who claimed in a 1997 lawsuit Trump tried to sexually assault her, made their claims long before the Washington Post published the infamous tape. Others came forward just days after the revelation of the tape and Trump’s subsequent denials. Jessica Leeds claimed in a New York Times article that Trump groped her on a plane while the two were seated next to each other. In the same article, Rachel Crooks, who worked in Trump Tower as a secretary, alleged that Trump would not let go of her hand after she introduced herself, and began kissing her. The two were in an elevator, she claimed. Virginia is the second woman to tell her story with the assistance of Allred. Last week, Allred held a similar press conference with Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice who claimed that Trump used a meeting about a job opportunity as a pretense to grope her and make sexual advances. Neither woman has announced plans to take legal action against Trump.', 'Randal Pinkett strode into the salmon-coloured marble atrium of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, stepped into a lift that glided up to the 26th floor and entered an office that, along with a vista of wintry Manhattan, was lined with signed memorabilia and magazine covers bearing the face of Donald John Trump. The first and only African American winner of the reality TV show The Apprentice had arrived for his first day at work. But when he walked in, Pinkett recalls, Trump was methodically working through a foot-high stack of magazines and newspapers on his desk. Each item in the stack had a Post-it note; and Trump took an item off the top of the stack, put it on his desk and opened it at the Post-it note. He read the relevant article then put it to the side. Disconcertingly, this ritual continued throughout their half-hour meeting in early 2006. “So I’m wondering,” Pinkett says, “is this guy reading current trends in real estate, is he reading stock market coverage, is he reading about global business? I lean over as we’re talking and I realise everything he’s looking at is an article about himself. In fact at several points in the conversation Donald got so excited about what he was reading about himself that he would pick up the magazine and hold it up to me and say, ‘Look Randal, do you see that The Apprentice was number one in the ratings last week, isn’t that great?’ “Apparently somebody’s job responsibility is to find all this stuff and to organise it for him to read. I can only conclude that Donald loves reading about Donald.” Donald loves reading about Donald. He has, according to many who know him, study him or write about him, made Donald his life’s work. Now he is seeking to perfect his masterpiece. His Jovian self-belief helped him sweep aside 16 rivals, including governors and senators, to become the first non-politician in decades to win a major party’s nomination for president. Barring a spectacular rebellion, the billionaire tycoon’s coronation will take place next week at the Republican convention in Cleveland ahead of what could be the ugliest election fight ever against Hillary Clinton. How Donald Trump got to this once unthinkable, preposterous height is a story of immigrant ancestors working hard and making good, of hustling and hucksterism, of show business and showmanship, of success and celebrity, of bending the truth and branding the enemy, of a particular interpretation of “the pursuit of happiness”. It is also a story of monumental ego undented by self-doubt. Trump’s swagger, eager to establish himself as the alpha male in the room, is said to be matched only by his lack of introspection. “He is a world-class narcissist,” says David Cay Johnston, author of the upcoming The Making of Donald Trump, who estimates his worth at no more than $1bn. “Donald believes that he is this incredibly great person and if you don’t recognise that, you’re a loser.” Once, boasting of his golfing prowess, Trump asked journalists: “Do I hit it long? Is Trump strong?” It would be no great surprise if, should he become president, he ordered his face carved into Mount Rushmore alongside Washington, Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Lincoln.\\nBut if there is one object that symbolises him, it is perhaps a mirror. Mirrors line the backdrop of the Trump Grill at Trump Tower, creating the illusion that it is double its actual size, while the lobby is full of shiny, reflective surfaces. Mirrors decorate the gaudy, gilded, Versailles-style ballrooms of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s would-be winter White House in Florida. His former butler there, Anthony Senecal, 84, says: “He’s really got good taste in mirrors.” But not, it seems, a rearview mirror. Mark Singer, who profiled Trump for the New Yorker in 1997, writes in a new book, Trump & Me: “OK,” I say. “You’re basically alone. Your wife is still asleep” – he was then married, but not for much longer, to his second wife, Marla Maples – “you’re in the bathroom shaving and you see yourself in the mirror. What are you thinking?” From Trump, a look of incomprehension. Me: “I mean, are you looking at yourself and thinking, ‘Wow. I’m Donald Trump’?” Trump remains puzzled. Me: “OK, I guess I’m asking, do you consider yourself ideal company?” (At the time, I deemed Trump’s reply unprintable. But that was then.) Trump: “You really want to know what I consider ideal company?” Me: “Yes.” Trump: “A total piece of ass.” Singer’s profile determined that Trump does not have an interior life. He “had aspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury”, it concluded, “an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul”. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Trump was probably best known to millions as the presenter of the American version of The Apprentice when, last June, he launched his wildly improbable presidential campaign at Trump Tower. After a now famous descent on an escalator, the property developer delivered a speech in which he said of Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Poison was introduced to the American body politic. It contained two key ingredients of the Trump philosophy: the scapegoating of immigrants and what he describes as “truthful hyperbole” which, he claims, is an innocent form of exaggeration and very effective form of promotion. Or to put it another way, “truthiness”, as defined by TV satirist Stephen Colbert – truth that comes from the gut rather than facts. These two ingredients are, in fact, baked into the Trump family history, where they stretched the truth about their own immigrant story to improve their prospects. His German grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was 16 when he arrived on a boat in lower Manhattan with a solitary suitcase in 1885. According to biographer Gwenda Blair, he learned English, became a naturalised US citizen, changed the spelling of his name to Frederick and made his way to Seattle to make his fortune – in the red-light district. He leased a tiny restaurant named the Poodle Dog, which had a kitchen and a bar and advertised “private rooms for ladies”. Blair says: “I began to look at Trump’s father and got a little bit of a notion of his grandfather and thought, wow, this is really a dynasty. This whole three-generation century of capitalism: they so embody that. The immigrants, the nose for the market, the getting it, that’s what counts, the salesman, the incredible work ethic. They’re all real strivers, really hard workers. Never back down, never give way, always follow success.”\\nFrederick Trump moved the family to Queens, New York, opened an office and bought some properties, but was killed by the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918. The business was inherited by his 12-year-old son, Fred, who survived the Great Depression and, Blair writes, told a “flat-out lie” by pretending to be a prosperous estate agent executive. He began to build an empire as a property developer and by the late 1920s was selling houses in Queens for nearly $4,000 each. He walked construction sites after hours picking up nails and putting them back into barrels to be reused. Fred claimed to be of Swedish, not German, descent because of anti-German sentiment in the US between the world wars. Until 1990, including in his 1987 best-seller, The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump himself claimed Swedish, not German, ancestry, even though his German grandmother lived across the street from the family until her death. It was an intergenerational white lie that arguably speaks volumes about Trump’s life and career of truthiness. In 1936 Fred Trump married Mary MacLeod, herself an immigrant from Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides, once described by Donald Trump as “serious Scotland”. They settled in Jamaica Estates, a secluded suburb in Queens with Tudor revival houses and English street names such as Avon, Chelsea, Croydon, Henley, Kent and Somerset. The Trumps’ first, relatively modest, home was on Wareham Place and is currently up for sale. A Muslim family lives two doors away and the community is now middle class and cosmopolitan.\\nJoseph Charles, 66, a languages professor born in Haiti, says: “I love this neighbourhood. This is the United Nations here. I don’t see anyone on this block voting for Trump, to tell the truth. I don’t like what he stands for and what he’s been saying about different ethnic groups. He has an immigrant background like everyone else so I don’t understand where he’s coming from. After a black president, he must be the ‘great white hope’.” The Trump family’s upward mobility is unmissable in their second abode, where Donald – born in June 1946 – and his four siblings spent most of their childhood, which is on a parallel street and an altogether grander affair with 23 rooms. Seventeen brick steps lead up a hill to the entrance, framed by a colonial-style portico, stained-glass crest and six white Doric columns. Neighbours dub it the “Gone with the Wind mansion”. There wasn’t much point in people in the area trying to keep up with the Trumps. They had Cadillac Convertibles parked in the driveway, with licence plates FT and FT1, and a swimming pool, though not many books. Mark Golding, a close childhood friend of Trump from ages six to 13, recalls being driven there by the family chauffeur. “It had a basement that had this great electric train set-up that I was really envious of Donny for having,” says Golding, 69, now a lawyer in Portland, Oregon. “There were four or five trains and they would go all around and pass each other, one would go up a bridge and down. It was the most amazing train set you’ve ever seen.” Golding, the son of a physician, would sometimes sleep over at the Trump house and, on Saturday mornings, the boys watched children’s TV shows such as Andy’s Gang, and Rin Tin Tin. “I remember that he had a colour TV at a time before we even got our first TV. Colour TV at that time was really pretty awful but I remember thinking wow, that’s pretty amazing. They had a cook and a chauffeur and that was a bit more than we had, and my parents were not poor by any means.” Trump was the tallest boy in school and Golding was second tallest, he recalls. “He was a good guy, at least to me. Some of the kids thought he was a little bit of a bully but I always got on pretty well with Donny. I don’t have specific memories of him ever bullying anybody else. At that time he was never a great student and actually didn’t get along all that well with most of the teachers.” Trump’s father was somewhat formal and strict, a quiet conservative and friend and donor to Barry Goldwater’s doomed 1964 campaign for president. His mother was sophisticated and impeccably dressed. In The Art of the Deal, Trump remembered his mother “being enthralled by the pomp and circumstance” of watching Queen Elizabeth’s coronation on TV. “She always had a flair for the dramatic and grand,” he wrote. “She was a very traditional housewife, but she also had a sense of the world beyond her.” On Sundays the family drove to Manhattan to worship at Marble Collegiate church, which would later host Trump’s wedding and his parents’ funerals. The head pastor was Norman Vincent Peale, dubbed “God’s salesman” and author of the tremendously influential bestseller The Power Of Positive Thinking.\\nAmong its directives: “Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding. Hold this picture tenaciously. Never permit it to fade. Your mind will seek to develop the picture … Do not build up obstacles in your imagination.” Blair says: “I think that’s what Trump has done. Everything is a success. I think we’ve seen that over the last year and occasionally marvelled at it. Wow, this guy is good at that! He has harnessed a lot of things, like Twitter, to assist him in doing that. He was like that from the start but he’s good at figuring out how to adapt.” Indeed, the influence of The Power Of Positive Thinking on Trump and his election campaign is not to be underestimated. He told the Iowa Family Leadership Summit last year: “I still remember [Peale’s] sermons. You could listen to him all day long. And when you left the church, you were disappointed it was over. He was the greatest guy.” But abruptly, the 13-year-old was yanked out of this serene life and packed off to the New York Military Academy (NYMA), a private boarding school. Blair, who interviewed him extensively, explains: “The story he tells is that he and another kid snuck into Manhattan on the subway and got switchblades, evidently with nothing bad in mind but they seemed cool, and dad sent him off to military school. Off he went and apparently just loved it.” Far from breaking him, military academy was the making of Trump. He thrived on the opportunity for competition over everything from tidying his room to shining his shoes and climbed the ranks. Cadets underwent basic military training (each was assigned an M1 rifle and learned how to break it down), studied an academic curriculum (Trump’s interest ended at geometry) and played sport (Trump excelled at baseball and basketball). Contemporaries recall that the academy had its share of bullying, including physical abuse, but that Trump was never involved as either perpetrator or victim. The young cadets were living in the shadow of the cold war and endured the uncertainty of the Cuban missile crisis, then the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963. Peter Ticktin, 70, now a lawyer in Boca Raton, Florida, says: “It had a big effect on all of us. We were all in shock. Everyone cried” – including Trump. Ticktin was a platoon sergeant while Trump, two years his senior, was a company captain. “He was self-confident, maybe a little smug. I wouldn’t go so far as to say arrogant because he was extremely approachable. There was no reason not to like Donald Trump. He was a good person and I think he still is. The same as he’s still tying his tie the same way [a Windsor knot], our honour code of not to lie, cheat or steal is still in him. “I don’t think we had one guy out of 99 who would have had a bad word to say about Donald Trump.” Another NYMA contemporary, Mike Pitkow, 67, a resident of Hilltown Township in Pennsylvania, adds: “There were many student officers who were quite egotistical and power hungry and Donald was not like that. I wouldn’t say he was modest but he had a sense of purpose: he seemed like he knew he was destined for something where he didn’t have to exude any power plays or ego or whatever. He was a decent and, I’d say, a nice guy.” Trump went on to Fordham University, then the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a degree in economics in 1968. He helped manage his father’s portfolio of residential housing projects for the middle class in Brooklyn and Queens and became favourite to succeed him after his elder brother, lacking the killer instinct that their father sought, became a pilot. His brother died at 43 due to alcoholism, a tragedy that Trump said led him to eschew alcohol, cigarettes and drugs all his life.\\nTrump made the most of his head start and, with a ferocious work ethic – he rises around 5am each day – set about building an empire. He crossed the East river to Manhattan, a much bigger and more lucrative stage, transforming the rundown Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and erecting the 68-story Trump Tower, where a portrait of Fred, who died in 1999, still overlooks a bar. Trump properties rose across America and around the world. Paul Willen, an architect who worked with him on the Grand Hyatt project, remembers a rare occasion when Trump was forced to back down over his plan for a vast complex, including the world’s tallest building, at a disused railway yard on Manhattan’s upper west side. “As a practical matter, once he had made his decision to build our scheme instead of his, I can’t say he was an unreasonable client,” Willen says. “Turning around the way he did, I had a certain admiration for his ability to do it quickly, efficiently, without any fuss.” Willen, 87, adds: “He was overbearing and very imperious and lording it over us but in the final analysis he would listen to us and he had to. He was building real buildings and he had to acknowledge us as architects and engineers and construction people and he was reasonable.” Trump, who favours hand-sewn suits from Italian menswear specialist Brioni, carved out a reputation as an audacious deal maker and master marketer. In his world, everything was the biggest, best and most beautiful because everything he touched would turn to gold. Trump also opened hotels and casinos, a venture that led to four bankruptcy filings, though he has never declared personal bankruptcy. The slump in his fortunes at the end of the greed-is-good 1980s coincided with the collapse of his marriage to Ivana, his wife of 14 years, following an affair with former beauty queen Maples.\\nTrump was forced to sell buildings, a Boeing 727 and his yacht, the Trump Princess, not that he was ever much of a sailor. But even at this personal and professional nadir, it seems, his self-belief was unshaken. Roger Stone, 63, a political consultant and friend since meeting Trump in 1979, claims: “I don’t think he ever lost faith in himself because he is the greatest negotiator that ever lived and, at a certain juncture, he figured out that he was worth more to the banks alive than he was dead, so if they took him down, they were going down with him and therefore he was able to negotiate incredible deals which not only saved his company but allowed him to rebuild from scratch. “When it comes to negotiation, he has got ice water in his veins … He’s a very tough negotiator. He leaves nothing on the table. I would not have wanted to be the banks because even though he owed them money, he had them by the throat.” Trump’s recovery in the 1990s – inevitably the cue for another book, The Art of the Comeback – included forays into the entertainment business and he took ownership of the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. But it was in 2003 that Trump’s celebrity gained liftoff with The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a shot at a management job within his organisation. He claimed in a financial disclosure form that he was paid a total of $213m by NBC. For years the equation of Trump = success was pumped into millions of homes. Blair notes: “It gave him 10 years of being in front of the American public being the boss, being CEO, hiring people, famously firing people, being the guy who can fix it, the one who knows everything, being the big authoritarian patriarchal guy. I think that has imprinted on a lot of people, that they ‘trust’ him, that that makes him ‘trustworthy’. That combined with the reality TV phenomenon in which it became acceptable to have something that wasn’t really true. It legitimised a kind of a not-quite-true thing and shifted our idea of what’s an acceptable version of reality.” Pinkett, 45, who won The Apprentice in 2005, agrees. “Reality TV, among other factors, has created this hyper-celebrity culture in America that we’re all now immersed in,” he says. “Celebrity has become its own form of capital and Donald is one of the chief beneficiaries of that cultural phenomenon of celebrity translating into capital. He went from a successful entrepreneur to a media personality and he is now cashing in on that celebrity capital.”\\nNow chairman and chief executive of a management, technology and policy consulting firm, Pinkett, from Somerset, New Jersey, continues: “I believe Donald is a very insecure man. Only somebody who is insecure, given Donald’s accomplishments and success and fame and wealth, feels the need to fire back harder than people fire at him and do it in a derogatory, demeaning way. “About two years ago somebody accused Donald of being a racist and Donald’s response to the racism claim was, ‘I hired Randal Pinkett as my apprentice and he has done an outstanding job, so how could I be a racist?’ Two months ago, when I held a press conference stating that I don’t think Donald is fit to be president, Donald’s response is: ‘Randal’s a failure and he did a terrible job for me.’ That’s classic Donald.” * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Trump Tower, located beside 178-year-old luxury jewelry store Tiffany & Co, throbs with activity in midtown Manhattan. On a recent weekday families in T-shirts and shorts milled around the Trump Bar, Trump Grill – where the menu includes Trump Scotch, a selection from the Trump Winery, a Trump Tower steak sandwich and Trump’s homemade ice cream – Trump Cafe, Trump’s Ice Cream Parlor and Trump Store, which sells his books, “Make America great again” baseball caps, “Success by Trump” deodorant sticks, “Donald J Trump signature collection” ties, Trump National Golf Club baseball caps and Trump Tower jelly beans and sour beans. The goods are posh but unpretentious, American but not artisanal, a world away from Brooklyn’s hipsters. A recent photo showed Trump on his private jet eating a McDonald’s Big Mac, fries and Diet Coke. Supporters say this shows his authenticity. Stone, who has wanted him to run for the White House since 1988, recalls the Republican national convention that year. “He was invited to a private black-tie dinner with then Vice-President George H W Bush and his running mate then Senator Dan Quayle. He looked at the engraved invitation which had been delivered by hand to his hotel suite and he said to me, ‘Call down to the desk and find out who has the best cheeseburger in town. Let’s stick this and go out for a burger.’ Trump could not be accused of being an elitist, highbrow, patrician snob. Unlike Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Bernie Sanders, he has not been spotted at the hit Broadway musical Hamilton. His desert island discs would, friends say, probably include Paul Anka, Tony Bennett and Elton John. Favourite movies include Pulp Fiction, Zulu and Sunset Boulevard, in which ageing actress Norma Desmond declares with Trumpian conviction: “I am big! It’s the pictures that got small.” In his New Yorker profile, Singer writes of Trump’s viewing habits during a flight to Mar-a-Lago. “He’d brought along Michael, a recent release, but 20 minutes after popping it into the VCR he got bored and switched to an old favorite, a Jean Claude Van Damme slugfest called Bloodsport, which he pronounced ‘an incredible, fantastic movie’. “By assigning to his son the task of fast-forwarding through all the plot exposition – Trump’s goal being ‘to get this two-hour movie down to 45 minutes’ – he eliminated any lulls between the nose hammering, kidney tenderizing, and shin whacking. When a beefy bad guy who was about to squish a normal-sized good guy received a crippling blow to the scrotum, I laughed. ‘Admit it, you’re laughing!’ Trump shouted. ‘You want to write that Donald Trump was loving this ridiculous Jean Claude Van Damme movie, but are you willing to put in there that you were loving it, too?’\\nIn the nine years since, Singer has seen nothing to alter his view of Trump as unburdened by a hinterland. “People talk about a private Trump and a public Trump,” he says in his Manhattan apartment. “I’m not so convinced because I’ve seen both and the bombast is there, the obvious extreme self-involvement has always been there. He doesn’t have a sense of irony. He’s a terrible listener but that’s a characteristic of narcissistic people. They’re not engaged with anybody else’s issues.” Singer’s New Yorker colleague writer Ken Auletta, 74, tells a character-defining story. Auletta, whose father was a nodding acquaintance of Trump’s father at a restaurant where each often had lunch, bumped into Trump years later at a New York Knicks basketball game. “He came over to me and he said, ‘Hey, Kenny!’ I don’t know anyone who calls me Kenny. He says, ‘Hey Kenny, how’s your pop?’ I said, ‘Well, actually he died.’ ‘Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.’ “So the next year at a Knicks game I see him and he says, ‘Kenny, how’s your pop?’ So I said, ‘Well, actually he died.’ ‘Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.’ The third year I see him, he says, ‘Hey Kenny, how’s your pop?’ I glared at him and I paused for a second and then I said, ‘My dad’s the same,’ and I walked away.”\\nTrump himself is a father and grandfather. He divorced Maples in 1999 and married Melania Knauss, a Slovenian model, in 2005. He has five children from three marriages. The offspring from his first – Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric – now help run the Trump Organisation and are playing an ever-expanding role in the election campaign. Stone, speaking from Miami Beach says: “I don’t think anybody would deny that he has a healthy ego but what he’s really into is his family. He’s extraordinarily proud of his family and proud of the role they’re taking in the business.” Stone, who has given many speeches on Trump’s behalf, agrees there is little room for self-reflection. “I don’t think he has a lot of time for psychobabble. Like Nixon and Reagan, both of whom I worked for, he’s not terribly introspective. He’s more interested in the next fight, the next battle.” The Trump persona appears to have devoured the man who created it. But does the great big beautiful winner, aiming to become the oldest US president in history, not shiver just a little when he contemplates death? “No,” replies Senecal, who butlered for him for nearly three decades. “He figures he’s going to live forever.” Pause. “And he probably will.”', 'Next week, Cleveland will host the Republican national convention for the first time since 1936. At least 50,000 visitors are expected. In anticipation, the city that’s been fighting for half a century to shake the moniker of “the mistake on the lake” has undertaken a vigorous campaign of beautification. It has hung an estimated 14,000 strands of “LED twinkle lights”, plus 1,000 banners. It has planted 275 new trees and put down 100 planters, installed 55 directional signs and maps. It has repaired sidewalks, spent $50m redesigning Public Square, and approved the construction of new hotels. Most of this activity is congregated downtown, an area of 3.2 square miles. Those 50,000 RNC visitors are expected to spend $200m in Cleveland over the course of five days – arguably the reason the largely Democratic city bid on the convention – but it’s unlikely they’ll spend much money, or time, outside downtown. “When I think about a convention, this is federal-level political process happening in a local place,” says artist Kate Sopko. “That local place should speak to that process.” Cleveland tends to feels both shrunken and stretched. At its peak, in 1950, it was the seventh-largest city in the nation; today, it has fewer than 400,000 residents. It has also undergone a demographic shift: whereas mid-century, African Americans made up about 30% of the population, today they account for a small majority, 53.3%. If the inhabitants of Cleveland could talk to the Republican conventioneers about their city, what would they say? This question was the impetus for Sopko’s project The Fixers, a series of six short documentary films released – at Spaces gallery, at screenings around Cleveland and online – in the lead-up to the RNC. (Full disclosure: I was art writer in residence at Spaces.) Each of the films considers a topic central to the lives of everyday Clevelanders – the education system, access to healthy food – by focusing on one or two knowledgable locals. These are the titular fixers, a term Sopko learned from a photojournalist that describes locals hired by foreign correspondents to help with finding sources and putting together stories. “We really need to show, through the voices of people on the ground in Cleveland, what’s happening here, how public policy influences our lives for better or worse,” says Sopko. “We need to have people be seen, because they won’t be seen [by the conventioneers]. The Fixers became the incentive to do that.”\\nSopko worked with six film-makers and eight fixers. The resulting videos are spare and meditative, mixing ambient music with clear-eyed shots of the city and interviews with discerning participants. In one, lifelong public-transit rider Marvetta Rutherford stands at the corner of Woodland Avenue and East 79th Street at 9pm amid the glare of a streetlight and falling snow. She laments that if she wants to catch a bus heading north or south at that time, “I’m pretty much out of luck”. In another, writer and community worker RA Washington and civil rights attorney Jacqueline Greene discuss the broken relationship between Cleveland’s African American community and its police department, which is operating under a consent decree with the Department of Justice after an investigation into its history of excessive force. They consider the implications of the federal government giving Cleveland’s police $50m for the RNC, $20m of which has been spent on new equipment, like riot gear, that will remain long after the convention has gone. “What this RNC coming to Cleveland represents for the community at large is a silence – an invisibility that is generations long,” says Washington in the film. “You’re seeing all these things that they beautify for the convention, and you’re thinking, well, where’s my voice?” Remembering Tamir Rice For most of the 20th century, thanks to the placement of public housing, redlining, and blockbusting, Cleveland’s African American population was confined almost entirely to a single east-side neighborhood, Central. When the community did expand, it was into nearby Hough, Glenville and East Cleveland, all of which remained highly segregated. The number of African Americans in the city grew steadily, but so too did the racism they faced: discrimination in employment, segregated schools, the construction of a network of highways that let white people speed past them while fleeing for the suburbs. These frustrations came to the boil in July 1966, when one of the owners of a cafe in Hough denied a black customer a glass of water and placed a sign outside that read “No Water for Niggers”. Violence broke out and lasted a week. Black Clevelanders, however, were in the midst of consolidating their political power. That activism’s biggest triumph came in 1967, when Carl Stokes was elected mayor – the first African American mayor of a major US city. Once in office, he embarked on a campaign of urban rehabilitation, including an attempt to reform the police. His progress was halted in July 1968, when a shootout in Glenville between police officers and members of a group called the Black Nationalists of New Libya sparked four days of rebellion. “When the riots did break out in the 60s, the city successfully repressed them and divided the city,” says Jeremy Bendik-Keymer, ethics professor at Case Western Reserve University. “This city’s police force is really suspect – Cleveland has a longstanding history of cronyism, of union in-gathering, and the public prosecutor is in cahoots with them. There’s a long history of the judicial system supporting the police. What you’ve got is a city that’s been divided and then it’s policed.” Seven people were killed that July in Glenville, including three police officers. The deaths of those officers spurred the formation of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association. After Tamir Rice was shot and killed by a Cleveland police officer while playing with a toy gun in 2014, the CPPA’s president, Steve Loomis, stated that the 12-year-old Rice had been “in the wrong”. The legal system, too, seemed to blame Tamir for his own death. Members of a grand jury declined to bring charges against the officer who killed Tamir, based on the recommendation of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor. Tamir’s family received $6m in the settlement of a wrongful death lawsuit that involved no admission of wrongdoing from the city. The only part of Cleveland that seems to admit to the crime is the spot where it happened: the gazebo at the Cudell Recreation Center. There’s been talk of the city removing it, but for now it stands, transformed by stuffed animals, homemade crosses, and a small butterfly-shaped garden into a makeshift memorial. On the day I visited, the stuffed animals seemed to huddle together for protection under the gazebo’s wooden roof, even as the sun lit up the park around them. Children played a few feet away, their carefree presence a sobering reminder of Tamir’s absence.\\n“It’s like that – it’s over,” says poet Ali McClain, who works in the Cudell neighborhood running a summer camp and afterschool program for girls, many of whom knew Tamir. She laments the lack of an official memorial, saying, “You would never know. It’s like it didn’t happen.” McClain is a co-founder, along with photographers Donald Black and Gabriel Gonzalez, of the art collective Acerbic, which advocates for artists of color in Cleveland. And for the RNC, Acerbic has decided it wants to remind not just the conventioneers but the whole world about Tamir Rice. The group is “concerned with making sure that his name and his story don’t disappear”, says McClain. “If we got 15,000 media, it’s gonna be the most photographed place in the world,” adds Black. “What do we want to say to the world?”\\nRemember Me Always. You Will Never Be Forgotten. These are some of the phrases appearing on T-shirts that Acerbic is printing for its Tamir Rice project. Positioned below Tamir’s first name, the slogans form part of a striking logo that looks like it might represent a real political campaign: stately white font, red-bordered box, white stars, blue shirt. Having recently invested in a direct-to-garment printer, the group plans to make and give away 500 such T-shirts during the RNC, subsidized by the sales of 100 of them in advance. Their campaign also involves posters and some street art, but Black and McClain won’t say much more about it, for fear of ruining the surprise (and being stopped by authorities). The two are relatively young, but their view is long, informed in equal parts by personal experiences, talking with Cleveland’s older artists of color about theirs, and a deep racial awareness. To them, as to many Clevelanders, Tamir’s death and the mishandling of it represent one more example of the racism entrenched in one of the most segregated metro areas in the country. “This is a majority black city run by all-white institutions,” laments Black – part of why Acerbic is seeking to become an institution of its own, run by and for artists of color. “A few people have said, ‘Donald, you seem so angry,’ and I am, I should be,” adds Black. “My feelings are hurt. I bought into this shit a long time ago. I wouldn’t have even tried to learn the system if you had just told me it’s not designed for me.” We the people Michelangelo Lovelace has been navigating the Cleveland system for more than 30 years – first as a 19-year-old artist finding his way, now as a 56-year-old who recently won a Cleveland Arts Prize. Lovelace paints vivid, figurative, folk-art-style images of the African American life he sees around him: street and party scenes, inner-city church funerals, allegories about the dangers of alcohol. Art has always, he says, served as a kind of therapy – when he was a child it was his comfort zone, and as he grew older, “it also became my release”. Over a lifetime in Cleveland, there’s been plenty for him to release: years of doing “the street thing”, divorces and bankruptcies, family deaths. Even as he speaks of these things, though, Lovelace’s disposition is unrelentingly cheerful and friendly, and with his art he follows a similar course: he channels adversity into paint. He tells me a story about a reception for last year’s Arts Prize. When Lovelace approached another winner who’s also a visual artist, the man made a racist remark that was so offensive, Lovelace and his wife left. “For me, that’s fuel for the fire,” he says. “Every time I think about that, I throw another log on the fire. You can’t get angry and burn down the house, cause it’ll just take you down.”\\nThis is also how he confronts the looming presence of Donald Trump, who’ll soon be arriving in Cleveland. Lovelace’s gallery, Maria Neil Art Project, offered him an exhibition for the month of July, during the RNC, and he accepted on the condition that he could “say what I want to say”. The show, titled We the People, features paintings that all use the American flag as a backdrop. Set against it are a wide range of vividly painted scenes, everything from a solemn vision of a multicultural populace to a woman at a stripper pole to a gruesome view of police brutality, in which a cop stands over a black man lying in a pool of blood. The latter echoes Lovelace’s Rodney King series, which he made after visiting Los Angeles in 1992. The King series borrows from the aesthetics of graffiti and street art, featuring spray-painted marks, newspaper clippings, and phrases like “No Justice, No Peace” atop painted bricks; the paintings pulse with anger and urgency. The We the People image, on the other hand, offers a scene painted in calm, confident strokes; it’s also an allegory of sorts, as a small black angel stands over the dead man with a sign that reads “Justice or Just-Us,” while in the background, three cops in a row cover, in turn, their eyes, mouth and ears. Nearly 25 years have passed in between the making of the two paintings. Lovelace’s artistic approach has changed, but the subject matter has not. Alton Sterling. Philando Castile. Rodney King. Tamir Rice. “Just because I pledge allegiance doesn’t mean I give up my blackness,” says Lovelace. “Sometimes they look at you like you a strange species, but I’m not, I’m American. Why be quiet? Why say nothing? Turn down for what?” And then, speaking about the coming national election but also, maybe inadvertently, about an earlier era in Cleveland’s history, he continues: “We the people have to make sure the politicians are doing what we put them there for. If we’re gonna change anything, it’s gonna be from the people.”', 'We keep being told that the Donald Trump phenomenon means we have entered the era of post-fact politics. Yet, I would argue, post-fact politics has been tarnishing democracy for some time. Twenty-two years ago a successful businessman sent a VHS tape to Italy’s news channels. It showed him sitting in a (fake) office. He read a pre-prepared statement via an autocue. The man’s name was Silvio Berlusconi, and he was announcing that he was, in his words, “taking the field”. The first reaction was derision. Opposition politicians saw his political project (the formation of a “movement” called Forza Italia – Go for it, Italy – just months ahead of a crucial general election) as a joke. Some claimed a stocking had been put over the camera to soften the impact of Berlusconi’s face. But Forza Italia soon became the biggest “party”. In the working-class Communist citadel of Mirafiori Sud in Turin, an unknown psychiatrist standing for Berlusconi’s movement beat a long-standing trade unionist. Berlusconi had not just won, he had also stolen the left’s clothes and some of its supporters. That first government was short lived, but Berlusconi would dominate Italian politics for the next 20 years – winning elections in 2001 and 2008 and losing by a handful of seats in 2006. In terms of days in office, Berlusconi ranks as Italy’s third longest-serving prime minister, behind Mussolini and the great liberal of 19th-century Italy, Giovanni Giolitti. The parallels between Berlusconi and Trump are striking. Both are successful businessman who struggle with “murky” aspects linked to their companies – tax, accounting, offshore companies. Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in 2013, which effectively put an end to his political career. But business success and huge wealth was part of his political appeal, as they are for Trump. Beyond wealth, Berlusconi, like Trump, always painted himself as an outsider, as anti-establishment, even when he was prime minister. And, like Trump, Berlusconi’s appeal was populist and linked to his individual “personality”. Berlusconi’s personal-business political model has since been followed by others in Italy. It could be argued that both Beppe Grillo’s populist anti-political Five Star Movement and Matteo Renzi’s insider-outsider appeal (until recently) have been created very much in Berlusconi’s image. One could go so far as to say Berlusconi transformed politics. The mass parties of the postwar period had become increasingly irrelevant, but he didn’t need a party just as Trump doesn’t really need the Republican party.\\nSo-called gaffes were a frequent part of Berlusconi’s political strategy – a dog-whistle strategy that included frequent recourse to sexist, homophobic and racist stereotypes, and reference to his belief that he was irresistible to women. He flaunted his Don Giovanni image, but also attempted to keep a parallel reputation as a family man, whose main concern was the welfare of his five children. His electoral campaigns were all about him. Nothing else mattered. He dominated the agenda from start to finish. When the former mayor of Rome Walter Veltroni tried to run a campaign against Berlusconi by not mentioning Berlusconi, he was heavily defeated. Silvio’s “gaffes” would usually be followed by claims that he had been “misunderstood” or was the victim of a “hostile media”. He was also reluctant to accept the verdict of the electorate as final when he lost. He would make frequent (and unsubstantiated) claims of electoral fraud and ballot-stuffing. Remind you of anyone? He also created a set of enemies against which he could mobilise his followers: the judiciary, the media (despite owning much of it), politics itself, Communism, women (he often commented on the appearance of female opponents) and the EU and the euro. He presented himself as a victim of political correctness gone mad, an ordinary/extraordinary man speaking his mind. He promised the world, and it mattered little if he was quickly proved wrong, or had no intention of fulfilling any of his promises. Berlusconi knew that many of the electorate had short memories indeed.\\nAnd as with Trump (at least until the “locker-room” video), Berlusconi’s scandals had little effect on his support. The numerous trials and journalistic scoops regarding Berlusconi’s private and business lives often seemed merely to reinforce his appeal. The message sent out was, for many, an attractive one. Be like me. Don’t pay taxes. Enjoy life and make money. Say what you want. We won’t bother you. He became so powerful at one stage that he even tried to make himself immune to prosecution, through a law passed by his own government. Luckily, Italy’s constitution forbade such a monstrosity. But the fact that it was even contemplated was worrying. Mass opposition to Berlusconi rose and fell at various times, and many took to the streets to protest. Yet his appeal also had roots deep in Italian society – and in a hatred of politics and politicians that has since moved onto other forms of populism. The Berlusconi phenomenon shows that a post-truth politician can rise to power in one of the world’s strongest and richest countries. The lesson for America is that for far too long Berlusconi was treated as a joke and a clown. By the end, nobody was laughing. Twenty years of Berlusconi at the centre of the system had a deeply damaging impact on Italy’s body politic and democratic culture and the wounds are by no means healed. Win or lose, Trump has shifted the terms of political discourse, campaigning and organisation. As with the Berlusconi era, things will never be the same again.', 'Bruce Springsteen has again condemned Donald Trump, with less than a month before the US presidential election. Springsteen, who had previously called the Republican presidential candidate “a moron”, told an audience in London: “It’s a terrible thing that’s happening in the States. He’s undermining the entire democratic tradition.”\\nSpringsteen was speaking at an invitation-only event for European press at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London to promote his autobiography, Born to Run. When asked by host Antoine de Caunes to explain to Europeans the appeal of Trump, Springsteen replied: “Nobody’s been able to explain that.” Springsteen also paid further tribute to Bob Dylan, following the latter winning the Nobel prize in literature. “Like a Rolling Stone was the first time I heard a version of my country that felt naggingly real,” he said. “Long after all of us are forgotten, Bob’s work is going to be ringing out loud and clear.” He contrasted Dylan’s writing favourably with his own work: “Bob’s certainly a poet. I’m a hardworking journeyman.” Born to Run dealt extensively with Springsteen’s family, covering not just his relationship with his parents and grandparents, but also the changes parenthood had wrought on his own life. He said the final section of the book, “writing about everyone you know now”, was the hardest to write. “I showed my kids the things I wrote about them,” he said. “Patti [Scialfa, his wife] and I discussed that section of the book and she didn’t change anything, [though] she wasn’t necessarily comfortable with everything. There were some things I wasn’t comfortable with myself. But she gave me a lot of room to explore.”\\nDiscussing how his troubled relationship with his father had affected his own parenting, he spoke of how people honour their own parents by trying to steer away from the things they had difficulty with and by passing on the things they did well. “The difficult thing was not having a role model to pass on what it meant to be a good parent,” he said. That meant being a father “did not come naturally: the suspension of deep personal time; the giving over of yourself at any moment of the day. I was used to my work taking over my time. It was my sacred space. To have ‘Hey! I need a ride to Billy’s house,’ was something it took me a while to get used to. But I have a good relationship with my kids. I wouldn’t say I was perfect, but I did OK.” He spoke, too, about how playing live had helped him cope with the depression that had struck him at intervals over the past 30 years. Playing such long sets – Springsteen routinely goes well past three hours when performing with the E Street Band – meant he would be “too tired to be depressed. To be depressed you need to have certain amount of energy, to go hunting through the weeds. There’s also a great centring element that wards off [the effects of depression]. It hardens your centre; that wards off self doubt and the unproductive questioning that comes with depression.”', 'The funniest standup I’ve ever seen I have to go with Spencer Jones as his alter-ego the Herbert, an oddball prop-comic who takes household items and turns them into characters in his little world. It is seriously clever stuff. The funniest book I’ve ever read Patrick deWitt’s The Sisters Brothers, which is a black comedy about two hitmen. It has such a dry, discernible wit in among the guns and violence. The funniest dream I’ve ever had I was in the audience watching myself totally smashing it on stage. It’s a shame I was only doing material by other comics. The funniest film I’ve ever seen Laurel and Hardy’s The Music Box influenced me so much as a child. It is essentially the story of two bumbling idiots trying to get a piano up a very steep staircase. You could never get comedy so pure today; there would have to be some sort of narrative about how Laurel’s drug problems had led him to store 400 kilos of crack inside the piano.\\nThe funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned I saw someone walking around Camden Town in cowboy boots and thought they looked pretty cool, so I decided to buy a pair. In retrospect, the reason the bloke pulled them off so well is because he had the full cowboy attire on; they didn’t quite work so well with a North Face jacket and chinos. The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had I seem to have a bowlcut in every photo from my childhood. This one time I dyed it red as well; at the time, I probably thought I was turning heads wherever I went like Richard Gere in An Officer And A Gentleman. I mean, I was turning heads – mainly for the fact that I resembled a magic mushroom. The funniest joke I’ve ever heard Donald Trump as the next president of the United States. It doesn’t make me laugh quite like it used to… Richard Gadd: Monkey See Monkey Do is at Upstairs, Soho Theatre, W1, Tue to 19 Nov', 'Nigel Farage has qualified his admiration of Donald Trump, saying he could not support his comments about groping women, banning Muslims from the US or derogatory remarks about Mexicans. The Ukip leader was pressed about his links to Trump in a new documentary presented by Jeremy Paxman on the US presidential race to be shown on the BBC on Monday. Farage, who has appeared at a rally with Trump and praised him in the spin room after one of the presidential debates, came under fire from some of his Ukip MEPs this week for defending the controversial Republican nominee.\\nAsked about the recent controversy over the “Trump tapes” about groping women, Farage told the programme that it had badly hurt the politician’s chance of becoming US president. “I just saw this whole thing as sort of, an extreme form of alpha-male boasting … as the kind of boasting that some men do – it doesn’t mean that they actually do it,” said Farage. While Farage has not explicitly endorsed Trump, he has appeared alongside him during the campaign and said he could never vote for the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Pressed again about his alliance with Trump, Farage told Paxman: “Well, look, it’s not just that is it? I mean, there were the comments about Mexicans, equally there was the idea that you could have a total ban on anybody coming into America from one particular religion. “You know, there are lots of things in this campaign that I couldn’t support in any way at all and nor do I … But I spoke to people who were, Trump voters – [they were] going to vote Trump in this election, and do you know what? – they couldn’t care less. They couldn’t give a damn what Trump says, who he offends because they see him as their weapon against the establishment and they see Hillary as being the epitome of that establishment.” Farage, who has returned temporarily as Ukip leader after the shortlived tenure of Diane James, said people were voting for Trump because of the “little people saying: ‘We have had enough ... and we want a change and we don’t care if that change causes a rupture’”. His remarks do not represent a complete disavowal of Trump, but acknowledge he is not entirely easy with some of the Republican candidate’s positions. His cooling toward the former Apprentice host came amid a flurry of new accusations from women who claim Trump sexually assaulted them. A former contestant on the reality business show, Summer Zervos, on Friday accused Trump of groping or aggressively kissing her on two separate occasions in 2007, when she met him privately for what she thought were going to be discussions about job opportunities.\\nZervos said Trump greeted her and said goodbye to her at a meeting in his New York office with a kiss on the lips. Brushing it off as his form of greeting, she said, she agreed to meet Trump for dinner later that year when he travelled to Los Angeles. She claimed that in the later meeting Trump greeted her with an open-mouthed, aggressive kiss while grabbing her shoulder and put his hand on her breast. Several times, she claimed, she pushed him away and indicated he should stop. Trump has fiercely denied all such accusations, which also followed a presidential debate last Sunday in which he said he had never done the things he boasted of in the Access Hollywood tape, remarks he said were merely “locker-room talk”. In his statement, Trump said: “I vaguely remember Ms Zervos as one of the many contestants on The Apprentice over the years. To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I’ve conducted my life. In fact, Ms Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on 14 April of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California.” Earlier this week, two Ukip MEPs publicly condemned Farage for appearing to play down the Trump tapes, with one saying he was trying to “defend the indefensible”. Jane Collins, who represents Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, said she had previously been a strong supporter of Farage, but “to make this kind of criminal behaviour seem normative makes me seriously question his judgment”. She said: “Trump’s sexist and derogatory comments have unequivocally proven he is totally unfit to be president of the United States, and Nigel Farage should think very carefully about defending him.”\\nIn a separate statement, William Dartmouth, Ukip MEP for South West England, said he wished to “strongly disassociate” himself from Farage’s defence of Trump’s remarks, adding that many of his fellow MEPs shared his view. Farage explains his opinion of Trump in the documentary Paxman on Trump Vs Clinton: Divided America for a special hour-long Panorama programme on BBC1 at 9pm on Monday. The documentary is an independent commission for the BBC, like a previous one about the EU referendum, and marks Paxman’s return to the channel since he left as the presenter of Newsnight in 2014 after 25 years. It coincides with the publication of Paxman’s memoir, A Life in Questions, which has already shown his readiness to criticise his paymasters as well as his political interviewees.', 'I was already feeling sorry for gorillas before London zoo’s Kumbuka made his unsuccessful bid for freedom. Their incarceration in zoos is bad enough, but this week I had begun to feel affronted on their behalf by the way gorillas are being casually used to justify aggressive human, usually male, behaviour. On Thursday’s Today programme, Bruno Monteyne, an investment analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, described the standoff between Unilever and Tesco as “two gorillas on behalf of the industry”. Much worse was Nigel Farage’s defence of Donald Trump’s rather menacing performance against Hilary Clinton as being like a “big silverback gorilla prowling the stage”. This was the day after he had excused Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” comment as “alpha-male boasting” and the “kind of thing men do”.\\nKumbuka’s escapade at London zoo on Thursday might, on first appearance, appear to justify the use of the silverback gorilla as the ultimate image of an aggressive and dangerous creature mainly preoccupied with asserting dominance. Apparently Kumbuku had a reputation for being “protective” of his family, and on this occasion he rushed aggressively at the glass, banging on it, before escaping into the keeper’s area behind his enclosure. But a more nuanced understanding of gorilla behaviour doesn’t bear out such projections. Although male gorillas in the wild do exhibit aggressive behaviour and can even kill baby gorillas, more often when they are in groups, which sometimes contain several co-existing males, they are gentle and sociable. Primatologists like Dian Fossey observed that like any primate, ourselves included, gorillas respond aggressively to stress and threat but are largely peaceable. There are no recorded instances of “alpha-male” behaviour including genital groping or chest thumping displays over the pricing of Marmite. In fact, the whole idea of the “alpha male” in nature – first popularised by Rudolph Schenkel in his study of wolves – has long since been discredited. It does not exist.\\nTo make comparisons between aggressive human males and gorillas is highly problematic. This is anthropomorphism which projects certain human characteristics it wants to “naturalise” on to the animals, in this instance male predatory sexual behaviour or business dominance and aggression. Aiming it at gorillas is not new. “Gorilla” was, and still is occasionally, used in its more 19th-century way, as an insult implying bestial stupidity. Now, however, Farage’s projections are typical. “Gorilla” is used as a shorthand for aggressive, dominant male behaviour as this Wiki entry makes clear: “‘800lb gorilla’ is an American English expression for a person or organisation so powerful that it can act without regard to the rights of others or the law.” It is the sheer size of mature male gorillas (although the more accurate weight is 400lb, not 800) and the existence of one dominant male in groups which have allowed certain aggressive human males to project their preoccupations on to gorillas.\\nBut our understanding of their behaviour has also been distorted by natural history programmes with their “alpha-male” preoccupations – and even more so by the existence of zoos. In confined enclosures and in small family groups, it’s easy to form an impression of one huge male dominating his little family. Zoos are also highly stressful environments, making aggression a very real possibility. It’s reported that visitors were banging on the windows of Kumbuka’s enclosure before his escape. When keepers decided to shoot silverback Harambe earlier this year at Cincinnati zoo, visitors were screaming and shouting at him as he stood over the boy who had climbed into his pen. There are different opinions on whether the gorilla would have harmed the boy, but aggression is certainly a well-documented response to fear and stress. In the wild, male dominance is much less striking to primatologists; instead they witness complex, nuanced behaviour where interaction between mothers, and attention to the young is just as important for group cohesion. Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent has larger enclosures and bigger groups of animals. It’s still captivity but it permits a glimpse of wild gorilla behaviour where maternal attentiveness and group cooperation is just as defining of a gorilla’s essential nature as the dominance behaviour of some males. There are, in short, just as strong grounds to call someone a gorilla if she’s an attentive mother. But that wouldn’t suit the likes of Farage, who seek not just to naturalise but to excuse certain types of human behaviour, making it seem as if treating women with contempt is something eternal and unchangeable. Maybe we should laugh it off. Except gorillas need all the help they can get at the moment and being associated with some of the least endearing examples of the human male is not good for their image.', 'Donald Trump’s first letter to Xi Jinping counts, by the US president’s low standards, as a successful stab at basic diplomacy. It\\xa0tepidly anticipates constructive relations with the Chinese president. Sent almost three weeks after his inauguration, it wishes the Chinese people a prosperous Year of the Rooster, which began almost a fortnight ago. The 20 or so world leaders to whom the new president has spoken have not included the man on the other side of arguably the most important bilateral relationship. Even if the letter precedes a phone call, China’s anxiety is understandable. Mr\\xa0Trump’s manifesto described it as “our enemy”. He has questioned the status quo over Taiwan, a red line for Beijing. Peter Navarro, head of his national trade council, is author of the menacingly titled book Death by China. Last year, Steve Bannon, Mr Trump’s chief strategist, said there was “no doubt” the nations would go to war over the territorial dispute in the South China Sea. Secretary of state Rex Tillerson has said China should be blocked from using the artificial islands it has built there. On the other side of the scales – rather lighter at present – are defence secretary James Mattis’s observation that he saw no need for dramatic military moves and the Chinese ambassador’s reportedly “cordial” dialogue with Jared Kushner, presidential son-in-law and adviser. It may be that Mr Trump’s team are trying to wrongfoot Beijing for negotiating purposes. China likes keeping people guessing as to its intentions; it is less keen to be on the other side. But a taskforce of China experts warned this week that the new administration’s volatility, combined with Beijing’s increasing authoritarianism and more forceful foreign policy, could prompt a dangerous confrontation. Beijing, which expressed “high appreciation” for Mr\\xa0Trump’s letter, is presumably playing for time as it tries to discern the US president’s intentions and because Mr Xi has limited bandwidth for foreign policy given the economic slowdown and the complicated domestic politicking required ahead of the five-yearly party congress this autumn. A\\xa0considerable number of US experts believe it should push Beijing harder on issues ranging from protectionism to its increasing domestic repression – though the latter seems unlikely to figure on Mr Trump’s agenda – and its handling of Taiwan. Some also believe China’s behaviour in the South and East China Seas must be countered quickly and decisively (easy to say, harder to do) because its military capability is developing so rapidly. But reshaping relations would require careful planning and calibration and a still closer relationship with others in the region, notably Japan and South Korea. Instead, as a candidate, Mr Trump grumbled that they should pay more for their own defence and might need nuclear weapons to protect themselves. As president he has abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a flawed multilateral trade deal designed to counter China’s regional ascendance. He has accused Japan of currency manipulation. He has even picked a fight with Australia, something hard for a US president to do without real effort. The Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe, who arrives in Washington on Friday, feels obliged to come bearing gifts: the offer of hefty investment. One of Tokyo’s concerns is that the president, who seems to see the world in crudely transactional terms, could ultimately cut a deal with China by selling out America’s old allies – just as he implied that Taiwan might be merely a bargaining chip in the relationship with Beijing. Chinese scholars have sometimes warned that their country has no real allies, only convenient partners. Mr Trump seems to regard that as an ideal outcome for America as well. He\\xa0is\\xa0wrong. The other, possibly greater, fear is of a bilateral clash destabilising the region. Local concern about China’s growing power does not mean a desire for confrontation at all costs. Either outcome would be damaging to the US, not just Asia.', 'The second US presidential debate was characterised by levels of vitriol never before seen on the US political stage. But while millions of viewers across the world watched in horror as the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton bloodied themselves over the Trump tapes, Clinton emails, tax, Syria and Obamacare, others saw the opportunity for humour.\\nEnter the memes. The combination of microphones and roaming candidates, aided by the town hall-style of the debate in St Louis, proved fertile ground for imagining an alternate reality – one where Clinton and Trump were serenading each other. As the debate ground on the #debatesongs hashtag spawned memes of the pair singing along to duets from Frozen, Grease and – probably most memorably – Dirty Dancing.\\nIn others, images of Trump and Clinton clutching their microphones were juxtaposed with lyrics sung by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers or Bing Crosby and Doris Day. Suddenly, partisan politics evaporated and was replaced by a large dollop of romance.\\nBut where some saw love and understanding, others only found animosity.', 'America has gone from the Obama Years to the Trump Years, like going from the West Wing to a sitcom where the incidental music involves a tuba. I actually think Donald Trump is going to prove a lot of people wrong, but sadly not George Orwell, Margaret Atwood, or whoever wrote the Book of Revelation. It says a lot about the man that building a giant wall isn’t even in the top five most Game of Thrones things about him. Of course, presidents always enter office with something to prove, it’s just rarely their sanity. You look into Trump’s eyes and you see the fear and confusion of a man who has just been told he’s got stage-four cervical cancer. He is a super-villain in a world without heroes, a man so obnoxious and unhappy that karma may see him reincarnated as himself. You kind of wish he’d get therapy, but at this stage it’s like hiring a window cleaner for a burning building. It’s still difficult to classify him exactly: he’s not a classic Nazi, but would burn books if his supporters knew how to read. Hillary Clinton was obviously the preferred establishment candidate, and whoever was on the rota for this election cycle at the Illuminati really dropped the ball, but Trump is still very much someone that the permanent powers have assessed they can work with. One of his first acts as president was an executive order to ban federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions. Making it clear that he’ll only provide billion-dollar funding to terminate young lives overseas if some kind of US-made drone is involved. This bill stops funding for birth control in countries where religion and culture mean women have no access to alcohol. Think it through – have you any idea how hard it is inducing a miscarriage just by drinking tonic? Call me a cynic, but when male politicians defund reproductive health centres, I always wonder how many abortions they’ve funded themselves. Is this just revenge for some clinic in the 1980s rejecting their idea for a loyalty card scheme? There’s probably business pressure behind this bill, too. Maybe American corporations are worried that fewer kids in the developing world means no one to do the detailed stitching on their clothing lines. I suppose everybody’s politics are shaped by the particular bubble they live in. Trump sees anti-choice arguments all the time; the only time he sees an argument for abortion is in a mirror. Trump cares about the same things a member of noughties rap outfit G Unit cares about: women, money and vengeance. Yet, random though it seems, his fight with the judiciary could well be tactical. He will blame them for the next act of terrorism that occurs then declare a state of emergency where everybody has to stay indoors while his tweets are read out over a Tannoy. I’m in an unusual position in that I don’t support Trump being invited to Britain, but I do hope he comes. Britain is divided at the moment and nothing unites us like hating Americans. Britain is good at mockery, and it will hopefully be a bit like when David Blaine came and sat in that plastic box. Of course, Farage has gone full Lord Haw-Haw, correctly gauging that history wasn’t going to judge him very kindly anyway, and that there might not be any. If the Queen ever has to shake Trump’s hand, she will put on so many gloves she’ll look like Mickey Mouse. I find it amusing that the same people who think it’s ridiculous for Mexico to be asked to pay for America’s wall think it’s fine for us to pay for Trident. To be fair, I managed to get my neighbour to build a wall and pay for it, and all it cost me was the price of a thong to sunbathe in.\\nMy best guess at the great man’s next move is the hoisting of an enormous burning eye above Trump Tower. It’s a building for which the words tacky and gaudy somehow seem too jolly and frivolous. Close up, it looks like the memory stick where some giant alien sex-killer stores his worst atrocities, or a version of the black slab in 2001: A Space Odyssey, sent to restore our consciousness to the level of chimpanzees. Trapped inside, Melania Trump has a look that I’ve never seen before, the eyes of someone waiting with increasing impatience for Stockholm syndrome to set in. The look of a woman frantically trying to unlearn English, appalled to find that this only makes her understand her husband more clearly. Perhaps women trapped in marriages with monsters resort to plastic surgery so that it becomes easier to leave a wax head in their bed while they work on their tunnel at night. Perhaps the manicures are to hide the endless digging. Perhaps it’s the secret of their figures. They’re not dieting, they’re eating those peanut butter and fried egg sandwiches Michael Phelps used to train on and spending their nights burrowing like a fucking gopher. You have to say it’s surprising that, with so much to work with, the response from the Democratic establishment has been to suggest that Trump is a Russian spy. How could he possibly keep a secret? He almost never stops talking, seemingly delivering a live feed of his internal monologue, using national television appearances to ramble about murdering terrorists’ families and blurt out fantasies about torture. Admittedly, any expert psychologist will tell you that torture does work, but only if you first threaten them with bare electrical wires. I’m equally baffled that so much Democratic criticism focuses on his incompetence and instability. Competent, focused Nazis are absolutely the worst kind.\\nEqually, I don’t really understand commentators who say it’s vital not to normalise any of Trump’s actions. They have been normalised for eight years by Barack Obama while many of the same people looked the other way. Banks and corporations writing their own legislation; war by executive order; mass deportations; kill lists: it’s all now as normal and American as earthquakes caused by fracked gases being ignited by burning abortion clinics. Of course, there is a moral difference in whether such actions are performed by a Harvard-educated constitutional law professor or a gibbering moron, and the distinction goes in Trump’s favour. That’s not to say Trump won’t plumb profound new depths of awfulness, like the disbanding of the environmental protection agency set up by hippy, libtard snowflake Richard Nixon. Obviously, the most important issue here is why America hasn’t done as well as in the past at capitalising on these horrors to create good music about the political turmoil. I mean, where is their Bob Dylan? Where are their anthems about drone warfare killing innocent civilians? Instead we’ve got Drake begging women via song to text him back after a fight at the Cheesecake Factory. Britain seems to be in an even deeper cultural torpor. Everything from Teen Vogue to young adult fiction has a more radical take than our press, and the Trump administration is satirised by American television with a venom that the British television industry, for its own government, does its best to avoid. Trump is at war with Saturday Night Live. He thinks it’s horrible and yet he can’t stop watching. Pretty much the same as how the world feels about him. How can he expect to escape ridicule? Being on reality TV is the closest he ever got to reality. His children look like a teen movie about Wall Street vampires directed by Uday Hussein. He has cultivated a square face that’s the shade of a banned food colouring and the muscle tone of a coma patient. He looks like aliens came to Earth and made a human costume after seeing one commercial for a car dealership. Really, he seems like the sort of person that a competent leftwinger with a humane alternative offer should be able to beat at the next election. Sad, really, that the only way Bernie Sanders could return in 2020 is as a glass sliding about a ouija board.\\nDuring the campaign, Trump said he wanted to stop America from making foreign military interventions, possibly because he realised he would need the army for suppressing the domestic population. Yet someone so media-obsessed can’t help but realise that among all the gaffes and flak, his insane aggression towards China and Iran has escaped censure. The media and political establishment largely approve. They only fret that he doesn’t take the same planet-threatening posture with Russia. War sells papers, television advertising and arms. It makes politicians feel important. It provides nationalism with clear enemies to define itself against. Despite all the other failures this administration promises, the US might finally be on time for a world war. So what do we do? I think, first of all, it’s worth noting that, under an authoritarian government, all protest will be vilified anyway. Even before Trump, people got very upset that quarterback Colin Kaepernick didn’t stand during the national anthem. You’d think that would fall under the list of White People Approved Forms of Protest, along with leaving a voicemail for your senator kindly asking them to stop shooting black people in the street. Personally, I think there’s limited value in moralising with, or fact-checking, regimes that don’t care about morals or facts. In Britain we also have an increasingly authoritarian government. We send them petitions telling them that we don’t want them reading our emails, which they presumably already know from reading our emails. We face a brief political period that, unchecked, will bring at least irreversible climate change and, at worst, nuclear war. Morally, I think you have to look at what you can do to change your own country first, as that’s the bit you have most influence on. This is complicated in Britain as we have a government that has undergone what is known in the business world as “regulatory capture” by corporate and financial interests, and is, broadly speaking, a vassal state of the US. What can we do practically to influence our own government that would truly affect the Trump administration? Well, in a country supposedly filled with restored national pride, we could not renew Trident and refuse to be his missile base. That kind of strategic loss would damage him deeply. No amount of likes or memes or petitions can achieve this. Really, if we want to survive as a species, it’s time for organised civil disobedience. It’s time to stop writing to your MP.', 'It should be self-evident that women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Yet throughout history, those in power – usually men – have tried to control women’s bodies. And some modern expressions of this are still limiting access to contraceptives and making safe abortions more difficult. President Donald Trump’s decision to ban American aid to all organisations that in any way advocate women’s right to abortions is very unfortunate. All experience shows that this kind of decision does not reduce the number of abortions; rather, it forces girls and women to revert to life-threatening procedures. Aside from the curtailment of human rights this represents, the policies of anti-abortion movements are catastrophic for those women who are at risk. For several decades, the Mexico City policy – also known as the global gag rule – has been implemented by Republican presidents and abolished by Democratic presidents. So we were not surprised that President Donald Trump reintroduced it. This time, though, it is more comprehensive and applies to all health aid. The US is one of the world’s largest donors of health aid in absolute terms, so there is a risk of this having far-reaching consequences. Maternal mortality has been halved since 1990; decisions of this kind risk endangering the progress that has been made. Some 800 women still die every day as a result of pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, with an absolute majority of these deaths in poor countries. These women and girls do not need less support – quite the contrary. We also see a risk that work on behalf of LGBTQ people’s human rights will be hampered, both in the US and around the world. Beside the global gag rule, there is a a worrying trend within the EU and elsewhere towards trying to hamper women’s freedoms, especially when it comes to sexual and reproductive rights. The Swedish government has launched a plan to limit the damage of this harmful policy ,and to help to reverse the trend. Sweden is increasing its support in 2017 to the UN population fund (UNFPA), the programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS) and the global fund, which are three key institutions in global sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) efforts. We are one of the world’s largest donors, and we will use our influence to strengthen women’s rights. We will contact UN leaders and ministers in progressive countries in the EU and around the world to mobilise political and financial support. We will coordinate new initiatives with the Netherlands and Belgium. Succeeding in building alliances with progressive countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa will be of particular importance.\\nThe Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) will send out concrete proposals on how Sweden can strengthen support to organisations working on SRHR, including those that provide information about, and offer, safe abortions. At the same time, Swedish embassies are initiating strategic advocacy efforts to encourage more countries to actively participate in this work. We will push for the EU to raise its political profile, stand up for women’s rights, and increase SRHR initiatives in EU aid. We will now contact those EU countries that do not take a position when these issues come up, and encourage more of them to raise their voices. Finally, we will closely monitor the effects that the new US policy has on the financing of various initiatives. We still do not know how Trump’s policy will impact on democracy assistance, support to human rights defenders or poverty reduction. We are in a transition period, in which women’s economic and political influence is strong and there is growing consensus in the international community for equality. Today’s resistance can be seen as a reaction to this success, and as proof that the struggle for the rights of women and LGBTQ people is a battle that must constantly be fought. The most controversial issue is also the most basic: the right to decide over your own body, sexuality and reproduction. There are still many women who are unable to decide whom to marry, whom to have sex with or when to have children. This is absurd, and should be relegated to the annals of history. The question remains: who should decide over a woman’s body, if not herself? Sweden has a feminist government. For us, the answer is obvious. Sweden’s development is based on the equal rights of men and women. We know that investments in gender equality and sexual and reproductive rights pay off. The world need strong leadership for women’s rights. Sweden will have an increasingly important role to play in this, and we will ensure that Swedish aid goes where it does the most good. Many countries could learn an important lesson from this.', 'Donald Trump is unfit to address MPs, according to the Speaker of the House of Commons, who said that he would refuse to invite the US president to speak at Westminster because of parliament’s long held opposition “to racism and to sexism”. John Bercow warned that the opportunity to speak in the prestigious Westminster Hall during a state visit “is not an automatic right, it is an earned honour” in an extraordinary intervention that divided MPs and annoyed No 10.\\nThe unprecedented step caused many MPs to pour praise on Bercow, but also triggered an angry response in parts of government with ministers privately claiming that he had overstepped the mark. Senior figures accused the Speaker of grandstanding – while his counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, was understood to be irritated by the unexpected statement. Bercow, whose role is non-political, told MPs that he did not have the power to block the state visit invitation extended to Trump by Theresa May, but made clear that he would use his authority to prevent what is considered one of the high points of the official trip. The Speaker made clear that he was always against the idea of Trump making a speech in the same hall that Barack Obama did in 2012, but said recent policies had left him even more determined to block the move. “After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,” Bercow told MPs, who were visibly shocked by his comments. “I would not wish to issue an invitation to president Trump.” In a raised voice, he added: “I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.” The Speaker made clear that invitations to address Westminster Hall were not simply issued by him but also Fowler. “The Lord Speaker was not consulted by Mr Bercow on his statement. The Lord Speaker will make his own statement tomorrow to the Lords,” said a House of Lords spokesperson. Bercow’s intervention is hugely significant because of the process by which a dignitary is invited to speak. Officials made clear that a government request to invite a head of state would be sent to Bercow and Fowler, who both have to agree to it. The lord great chamberlain, who represents the Queen, is then consulted. His unexpectedly strong response shocked ministers and Downing Street officials, who have been working hard to build relations with the new president, including through the recent visit in which Trump grasped hold of the prime minister’s hand. May has also offered to be a “bridge” to Trump for European Union leaders, in a bid to make the most of the special relationship, which is seen as increasingly important by advisers following the Brexit vote. “Bercow better make sure of the president’s plan before he shoots off like this. The clear indications are that the White House are not even planning to address both houses of parliament,” one government source said. Others claimed that Bercow had been “hugely political and out of line”.\\nThe mood in Downing Street was said to be mild annoyance with the Speaker, with some questioning “if there is anything else that has never been proposed to which he would like to object”. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Bercow’s statement. But there was also a sense that the Speaker – who has sat as a Conservative MP – was sufficiently separate to May for his comments to be of “no real consequence”. Bercow was responding to a point of order by Labour MP Stephen Doughty, whose early day motion calling on officials to withhold permission for an address to Westminster Hall was signed by 163 colleagues. The MP said he had informed the Speaker about the fact that he would raise the issue, in a standard courtesy, but was shocked by the strength of response. “I am delighted that the Speaker has listened to members from across the house regarding our deep concerns that Donald Trump not be honoured with an address in Westminster Hall or elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster, after his comments and actions on women, torture, refugees and the judiciary,” he said. Labour’s Yvette Cooper said Trump was “continuing his assault on the democratic values that the British Parliament holds dear”. She said it was fine to invite him to the UK but not to offer the “special privilege of an address in the heart of our democracy”. And Chi Onwurah said that more than 1.8 million people had signed a petition against a Trump address at Westminster Hall, saying it was “ridiculous” to allow it to go ahead. “I am glad the Speaker has given voice to what so many feel.” Tory MP Heidi Allen admitted the comments were “controversial” for some, but insisted they were right. However, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said a number of his colleagues were surprised and annoyed by Bercow’s intervention. “He’s completely overstepped the mark. It was a pre-emptive strike to torpedo the leader of the democratically free world and our greatest ally from speaking in parliament,” he said, stressing the importance of a UK-US trade deal. “Our relationship is now more important than at any time than the second world war.” Bercow made clear that he had less say over the Royal Gallery — a second, smaller room that is used by world leaders to address parliamentarians — although he said he still had “a say in that matter”. The government has rolled out the red carpet in a state visit more than 100 times, with controversial figures including Vladimir Putin and Robert Mugabe travelling to Britain for the honour. However, visits do not always include an invitation to address parliament. Westminster Hall tends to be limited to the most coveted guests, which have included the Pope, Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama. Other leaders, including Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, have spoken in the Royal Gallery. Government sources have told the Guardian that Trump would see such an address as “the ultimate establishment” act and claimed he would not want it. Instead, he is keen on the “pomp and ceremony” of a visit with the Queen, a military parade and golf at Balmoral palace.', 'Rupert Murdoch was in the room when Donald Trump gave his first post-election foreign newspaper interview in the UK to the Times and former government minister Michael Gove. It is unclear whether the media mogul was present throughout the interview, held in Trump Tower in New York, or simply introduced the Times columnist to the president, although the Financial Times said Murdoch sat through the whole interview. Murdoch, whose News Corp owns the Times, is believed to have orchestrated the meeting between the former Conservative minister and the president but details of his presence emerged weeks after the hour-long meeting. The interview confirmed the Murdoch empire as Trump’s favourite media outlet; he has granted regular access to Sean Hannity of Fox News, also owned by Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. One insider at News Corp said Murdoch would be unlikely to have sat quietly throughout the interview and could just have introduced them at the beginning. He appeared in none of the extensive pictures taken of the meeting in the Times. Gove shared the interview with Bild’s Kai Diekmann, who sits on the board of directors set up to guarantee the independence of the Times when Murdoch bought the paper. Unlike Gove, Diekmann refused to pose thumbs up alongside the president in front of a framed copy of Playboy. The interview, in which Gove not only scooped all other British newspapers but also the prime minister and cabinet team in meeting the new president, covered several contentious issues of foreign policy, including trade and Brexit.\\nA video clip of the interview shows Gove asking the president if the UK is now “at the front of the queue” for a US trade deal. Trump also condemns the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for her decision to admit 1 million refugees, calling it a “very catastrophic mistake” before describing refugees as “illegals”. Further evidence of Trump’s opinion of the mainstream media is given when he tells Gove that he intends to keep tweeting as @realDonaldTrump as a way of bypassing journalists and going straight to … Fox News. “The tweeting, I thought I’d do less of it, but I’m covered so dishonestly by the press – so dishonestly – that I can put out Twitter – and it’s not 140, it’s now 280 – I can go bing bing bing … and they put it on and as soon as I tweet it out – this morning on television, Fox – ‘Donald Trump, we have breaking news’.” Murdoch has long been a supporter of the former justice secretary. He offered public and private support throughout Gove’s Conservative leadership bid and a £150,000-a-year job at the Times on top of his salary as an MP soon after he was defeated. The media boss is also known to admire Trump. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, was a trustee for the patriarch’s two youngest daughters until December. Murdoch’s former chief of staff, Natalie Ravitz, now at the NFL, tweeted a picture of Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, sitting in on a Trump interview. She added: “It’s not his personality to sit front and center. Lets journalists do their job but is interested as a newsman”.\\nNews Corp declined to comment.', '', 'Two Ukip MEPs have publicly condemned Nigel Farage for appearing to play down Donald Trump’s comments about groping women, with one saying the interim party leader was trying to “defend the indefensible”. Senior Ukip figures have privately expressed concern at Farage’s recent comments supporting Trump, which have seen him address a rally for the Republican candidate and talk him up in the spin room after the latest presidential debate. However, the MEPs are the first to publicly criticise Farage for dismissing Trump’s comments as “alpha male boasting”. Jane Collins, who represents Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, said she had previously been a strong supporter of Farage, but “to make this kind of criminal behaviour seem normative makes me seriously question his judgment”. She said: “Trump’s sexist and derogatory comments have unequivocally proven he is totally unfit to be president of the United States, and Nigel Farage should think very carefully about defending him.” In a separate statement, William Dartmouth, Ukip MEP for the south-west of England, said he wished to “strongly disassociate myself” from Farage’s seeming defence of Trump’s remarks, adding that many of his fellow MEPs shared his view. “I am a supporter, even, on occasion, an admirer of Nigel. But this goes too far,” Dartmouth said. “What message does it send to us in the UK for Nigel to be an apologist for Mr Trump? “This is not usual locker room chat, nor indeed is Mr Trump’s view shared by very many men,” he said. “Nigel is the present leader of Ukip and when he speaks, it will be supposed he speaks for the party. On this matter he does not, should not and cannot.” One leading Ukip figure, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian that party members had been “genuinely appalled” at the apparent defence of Trump’s comments. They said: “And he’s contradicting himself – saying that what Donald Trump said about groping women was just alpha male banter, and yet with the incidents with migrants in Cologne on New Year’s Eve he very rightly condemned it. “It’s total hypocrisy to say it’s OK if a rich, white man who’s running for president does it.” The 11-year-old recording of Trump’s remarks, released over the weekend, has led many leading Republicans drop their support for him. In the recording Trump discusses with the TV host Billy Bush a failed attempt to sleep with a married woman, before talking more generally about women. “I am automatically attracted to beautiful women,” Trump said. “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss, I don’t even wait … and when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.” He added: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” Speaking in Missouri before Sunday’s presidential debate, Farage said of the comments: “Look, this is alpha male boasting. It’s the kind of thing, if we are being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this. “By the way, quite a lot of women say things amongst themselves that they would not want to see on Fox News or the front page of a newspaper. I’m not pretending it’s good – it’s ugly, it is ugly.” Collins said Trump’s remarks were “not normal, nor are they acceptable”. She added: “There is never an excuse for sexual assault and way too many women already suffer in silence from fear of having to face these entrenched attitudes that this type of behaviour is OK.” Farage, who resumed the Ukip leadership temporarily after his replacement, Diane James, resigned after 18 days in the role, remains credited by most senior party figures as having been central to its success. But several have said privately that they fear his love of the spotlight and his association with Trump are now damaging the party.', 'Less than two hours before appearing on stage for the second presidential debate, Donald Trump staged a surprise event with women who have accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing. Just days after he told a crowd in New Hampshire he would rather make the second debate about “policy” rather than “in the gutter” he held a three-minute press conference with four women.\\nOne of them bluntly stated: “Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me.” In a statement issued in response, Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said: “We’re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom.” Speaking in a conference room to a handful of reporters in an event aired on Facebook Live, Trump appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathy Shelton and Kathleen Willey. Three of the four women have claimed inappropriate sexual contact with Bill Clinton. Shelton was the victim in a 1975 rape case in which Hillary Clinton, in her capacity as a lawyer, was assigned by an Arkansas court to represent her alleged assailant. All four were subsequently Trump’s guests in the debate hall. Both Jones and Willey have alleged inappropriate sexual conduct by Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Jones claimed in a civil law suit in 1994 that the then Arkansas governor propositioned her and exposed himself to her in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton denied the accusations. Jones’s case was settled without admission of guilt, with Clinton paying her $850,000. Willey, a former White House aide, accused Clinton in 1998 on 60 Minutes that the president had sexually harassed her during a meeting in the Oval Office in 1993. The Office Of Independent Counsel reviewed Willey’s claims and found them inconclusive, saying Clinton and Willey were the only witnesses to the allegation and that Willey gave false evidence to the FBI. Through lawyers, Clinton denied the accusation. The women took turns in speaking, after Trump had praised their courage. Broaddrick, who has alleged that the former president raped her in 1978, when he was Arkansas attorney general, spoke in the most stark terms. Trump has mentioned her on social media several times in the run-up to the debate, tweeting several times. He even retweeted her tweets, a step rarely taken by the candidate who normally manually quotes tweets. Broaddrick alleges that Clinton raped her in a hotel room while violently biting her upper lip. Clinton has flatly denied the claims, which emerged publicly in 1999 during the investigation of the former president by the independent counsel Ken Starr. The year earlier, Broaddrick had filed a sworn affidavit saying that the allegations against Clinton were untrue. Starr ruled that Broaddrick’s testimony about the incident was “inconclusive” and did not use it. Friends of Broaddrick say she told them about the alleged incident at the time. At the press conference, Shelton said: “Hillary put me through something you should never put a 12-year-old through.” The former secretary of state served as the lawyer for an alleged rapist, Thomas Alfred Taylor in 1975. She was appointed by the court to represent the man, one of two accused of raping Shelton, who was then 12. Taylor eventually took a plea bargain for a lesser charge. In her statement, Palmieri continued: “Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn’t change that. “If Donald Trump doesn’t see that, that’s his loss. As always, she’s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.” Ivanka Trump, who has been one of her father’s top surrogates in his attempts to appeal to women, did not immediately comment. When reached on Saturday with a request for comment about the mounting controversy surrounding her father’s campaign, she hung up on the Guardian.\\nTrump’s press event came just 48 hours after a tape was released of the candidate making obscene boasts about using his fame to kiss and grope women without their consent. The tape, captured on a live microphone with then Access Hollywood host Billy Bush in 2005, includes the statement: “I am automatically attracted to beautiful women. I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss, I don’t even wait … and when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.” Trump, then 59 years old and newly married to his third wife, Melania, adds: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” Although the Republican nominee issued a videotaped apology after midnight on Friday, the mounting controversy has led a growing number of Republicans to announce that they will not vote for Trump in November. These included the party’s 2008 nominee, John McCain, and a number of other senators in a tight re-election battles including Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Trump did not address questions from reporters about whether he had groped women without their consent, instead sitting silently while Paula Jones angrily proclaimed: “Why don’t you all ask Bill Clinton that? Why don’t you all ask Bill Clinton that?” This article was amended on 11 October 2016 to remove a statement that Donald Trump had signaled that he was willing to campaign in the gutter.', 'As a general rule, alliances between nations as close as Australia and the United States are bigger than the leaders. But with Donald Trump as leader, the general rules have been discarded. While Trump remains president, Australia should be very wary of seeking closer ties, but rather should be willing to let the bigger partner know that we might be small, but we are vital. On Monday morning, the NFL Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons will be played, and despite no Australian participating in the event, barely any Australians even playing the sport, and only a few more who understand it, it will be broadcast live on free-to-air TV over six hours. In a couple of weeks, American cable network HBO will begin broadcasting the TV series Big Little Lies based on the novel by the Australian author Liane Moriarty and starring Nicole Kidman. The US and Australia are, it is fair to say, very much culturally intertwined. That will not change no matter how many times Trump abuses our prime minister. The news this week that Trump yelled at Malcolm Turnbull over the phone about how bad a deal the plan was for the US to take 1,250 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru rings so true that there is little worth in either government running with the “courteous discussion” line.\\nTrump showing anyone a lack of respect – let alone the leader of one of the US’s closest allies – is not only not surprising, it is expected. And while it won’t end any alliance between the two nations, it should be a sign that things must change. The relationship is of course more than just cultural, but it has greatly shifted over the years. No longer, as was the case during the cold war, does Australia catch a cold every time the US sneezes. Since the 1990s, as we increased our exports to China, we have been able to go along somewhat different economic paths. That isn’t to say the US is not important to our economy – it is our third biggest trading partner. But it is a distant third – the amount of trade with the US is roughly worth about 30% of our trade with China. And imports account for most of that trade. Our trade deficit with the US is larger than with any other nation. In 2016, we imported about $17bn more in merchandise from the US than we exported to them. By contrast, our merchandise exports to China were $21bn more than what we imported:\\nThe US does remain the biggest source of foreign investment for Australia, but our economic fortunes are now very much more connected to China than America. The relationship is of course bound by more than economics. Since WWII, as is often noted, we have fought alongside the US in every major war – Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq and now against Islamic State. But it is a relationship where Australia often gets ignored or forgotten. You don’t need to be prime ministers Trunbull, or John Hunt to know that Americans can often be less knowledgeable of us than we are of them. Similarly, despite that willingness to be side by side in battle, our sacrifice is not always appreciated in a fitting manner. Robert MacNamara, the secretary of defence from 1961 to 1968, for example, remarked in the documentary The Fog of War that the US should have realised its cause in Vietnam was wrong because “none of our allies supported us; not Japan, not Germany, not Britain or France”.\\nNone? That’s a pretty sharp slap to the face of the nearly 60,000 Australian men and women who served in the Vietnam War, let alone the 521 who died. But the military alliance with the US is not all one way. Since 1956, Australia has been part of the “five eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance. Our position on the globe is also vital for US defence interests, giving it the ability to monitor signals and control drones in Afghanistan, and keep in touch with US satellites for its early warning missile defence system. You wonder if at any point in his conversation with Trump whether Turnbull felt like suggesting that the US president google “Pine Gap”? He could also have suggested that Trump ask his defence chiefs where Darwin is located on a map so he could find out where a thousand or so US marines are stationed, or maybe he could also ask just why F-22 Raptors will be flying out of RAAF Base Tindal? We are small, but vital to US interests. The importance of leaders across alliances is rather overstated and good for PR purposes. It allows the leaders to leak to journalists news of how the prime minister got on so well with the president that special favours were being done for us. Mostly it’s hogwash – as the latest spin early this week turned out to be. But leaders do matter – especially when one is as reckless as Trump. Trump is unlikely to do us much direct damage. He could try to pull out of our free-trade agreement, but that would more likely hurt the US economy than ours. Most of the damage he could do economically would come via ricochets, should he send the US into a trade war with China. Such a war might slow the world economy and thus weaken the demand for our exports, but were it to allow China to take a more central role in the world economy Australia could possibly benefit .\\nThe reality is there is little to be gained at the moment from Turnbull seeking to engage closely with Trump. The orange megalomaniac in the White House never sees deals as a chance for a win-win, nor even as merely a zero-sum game. As Gore Vidal would say, for Trump it is not enough to succeed, others must fail – and if that is not possible, as Turnbull found out this week, others must be humiliated. Given our long cultural, economic and defence ties, suggestions that we shift towards a greater alliance with China are fanciful. We may sell a lot of stuff to China, but we would be extremely foolish to think China is as invested in protecting our security interests as has been the US. But clearly while Trump is in power the relationship must change – especially the assumption that we’ll always be side by side in any battle. While support for fighting Isis is unlikely to change soon, any Australian leader sending us to any new wars, such as against Iran or involving China – as has been predicted by Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon – would face a massive political backlash. Frighteningly, one report early this week suggested Trump’s accepting the refugee deal was based on the assumption we would reciprocate with support for such things as greater military support in Iraq and Syria, and for “freedom-of-navigation exercises in the South China Sea”. The reality is, there is very little Trump could threaten us with. We might be small, our names might be forgotten, but we are one of the best friends the US has ever had, and it needs us. Trump might not realise it, but our government certainly should.', 'Donald Trump has once again defended Vladimir Putin against accusations that he is a killer, telling Fox News: “We’ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country’s so innocent?” The US president appeared to place the US and Russia on the same moral plane in an interview broadcast before the Super Bowl kicked off in Houston, Texas. Asked by the host, Bill O’Reilly, if he respected Putin, Trump replied: “I do respect Putin. “Will I get along with him? I have no idea. It’s very possible I won’t.” O’Reilly said: “He’s a killer, though. Putin’s a killer.” “There are a lot of killers,” Trump replied. “We’ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country’s so innocent?”\\nTrump’s respect for and willingness to work with Putin was a familiar theme during an election that the US intelligence agencies believe their Russian counterparts sought to influence on Trump’s behalf. Such claims prompted a split between Trump and the intelligence community that has not yet healed. The two presidents spoke by phone last weekend, a conversation reportedly much smoother than calls with leaders of allies such as Australia. A summit meeting has been mooted by both governments. It has previously been suggested to Trump that Putin is a killer. In December 2015, the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough told Trump: “He kills journalists that don’t agree with him.” Trump replied: “Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing too, Joe.” The same week, Trump told ABC News: “In all fairness to Putin, you’re saying he killed people. I haven’t seen that. I don’t know that he has. “If he has killed reporters I think that’s terrible. But this isn’t like somebody that’s stood with a gun and he’s taken the blame or he’s admitted that he’s killed. He’s always denied it. “It’s never been proven that he’s killed anybody, so you know you’re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, at least in our country. He has not been proven that he’s killed reporters.” After O’Reilly said he did not “know of any government leaders that are killers”, Trump turned to the Iraq war, seeming to equate George W Bush with Putin, though he did not name the former president. “Take a look at what we’ve done too. We’ve made a lot of mistakes,” he said, adding, falsely, that he had opposed invasion. “I’ve been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.” “A lot of mistakes,” Trump continued, “OK, but a lot of people were killed. So a lot of killers around, believe me.” On Monday the Kremlin said it wanted an apology from Fox News over O’Reilly’s “unacceptable” comments. “We consider such words from the Fox TV company to be unacceptable and insulting and, honestly speaking, we would prefer to get an apology from such a respected TV company,” the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on a conference call. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 36 journalists have been murdered in Russia since 1992, 23 since Putin first became president in 2000. Most famously, Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in 2006 while investigating torture in Chechnya. Trump has said he accepts reports that Russia was behind hacks against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, but rejected the notion that he could not have won the White House without Russian help. Investigations into links between Trump aides and Russian actors are ongoing. The Arizona senator, John McCain, a fierce opponent of lifting sanctions on Russia, a prospect with which Trump has flirted, has said the Russian president is “a murderer and a thug”.\\nOn Sunday the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, issued a mild rebuke to Trump. Asked what his response would have been if Barack Obama had compared the US to Russia under Putin, he said Putin was a “former KGB agent and a thug”. “I don’t think there’s any equivalency between the way Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does,” he said. “I’m not going to critique the president’s every utterance, but I do think that America is exceptional, America is different, we don’t operate in any way the way the Russians do. There’s a clear distinction here that all Americans understand and I would not have characterised it that way.” Marco Rubio, senator for Florida and an opponent in the presidential primary, was harsher. “When has a Democratic political activist been poisoned by the GOP or vice versa?” he said in a tweet. “We are not the same as Putin.” Trump also answered a question from O’Reilly about his oft-stated but never evidenced belief that his defeat by a margin of nearly 3 million in the popular vote had been caused by massive voter fraud.\\n“When you see … people who are not citizens and they are [on] the registration rolls … it’s a really bad situation,” Fox quoted Trump as saying. Trump also said he was willing to work with Kiev and Moscow to resolve the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, after a telephone call with the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, on Saturday. The call was the first direct contact between the two leaders since the inauguration of Trump, whose aim to improve relations with the Kremlin has alarmed Kiev while the nearly three-year-old conflict remains unresolved. It followed fresh artillery attacks in the Donbass region of Ukraine, which broke a lull in shelling at a frontline hotspot that had raised hopes the conflict’s worst escalation in months was waning. “We will work with Ukraine, Russia and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border,” Trump said in a White House statement after talking to Poroshenko.', 'Photographs of Donald Trump wearing a bathrobe have been shared on social media in response to his press secretary’s assertion he “definitely doesn’t wear one”. An article published in the New York Times on Sunday painted an unsettling picture of life in the White House, with aides unable to locate light switches being forced to meet in the dark, visitors being left to find their own way out of the building after meetings and a “darkened, mostly empty West Wing”. The president, it was reported, spent considerable time “watching television in his bathrobe” and marking up negative news reports with a black Sharpie. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the story was “so riddled with inaccuracies and lies” that the New York Times owed Trump an apology. Trump, too, tweeted that the report by the “failing” newspaper was “total fiction”.\\nSpicer took particular issue with the bathrobe report, which he said was “literally the epitome of fake news”. “I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe,” he said. “He definitely doesn’t wear one.” Some on social media wondered about the basis for Spicer’s assertion.\\nThe press secretary’s priorities were also called into question, given that the Times had also reported that Trump was not fully briefed on the specifics of an executive order he signed granting his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, a seat on the National Security Council.\\nBut Spicer’s statement that the president “definitely” did not wear a bathrobe was called into question when old photographs of Trump rugged up in towelling and terry cloth were circulated on social media.\\nThat a hotel magnate would not have a bathrobe struck some as unlikely.\\nIn July last year, the television personality Mike Rowe auctioned off a robe from Trump Tower that had been autographed by the now-president.\\nMany more expressed displeasure at seeing dated pictures of Trump donning a robe.', 'When the president of the United States maligns a federal judge on a medium that reaches millions of people, his action is not only inappropriate to his office, uncivil in the extreme, and a threat to national security. It is also an announcement of the president’s desire for regime change. The refugee and immigration policy that the president is defending against the judiciary is worse than indefensible. Aside from being sloppily constructed and almost certainly illegal, it has made the problem it is meant to address worse. The executive order did not mention the actual countries from which actual terrorists have come, such as Saudi Arabia and the Russian federation. By calling citizens of whole countries “potential terrorists”, the president has just confirmed the impression that a religion is being targeted as such. It is much more likely that its aim was to provoke an act of terror than to prevent one. If one takes place, the president will likely claim that he was right all along, and argue that repression of American residents and citizens are necessary.\\nThe president wrote in a 4 February tweet of “bad people” and the risks they pose. The greatest national security risk is the one created by the president’s irresponsibility. By announcing a policy of total discrimination against citizens of Iraq, for example, the president insulted soldiers of an army that is fighting alongside the American one. By hindering the arrival of people who worked alongside the American armed forces in the Middle East, he has made clear that Americans sell out their friends. Among the “bad people” are many students with much to offer the US, including a young Iranian who, having protested the Iranian regime, was pressured to emigrate. Now the country where he chose to emigrate, the US, is treating him much the same way. The moral costs of the policy, and of its reckless defense, are enormous. But that’s not the worst of it. The major implication of the president’s tweet is the form it takes: an attack on a federal judge. Singling out a federal judge for presidential calumny is a profound, and no doubt deliberate, assault on the two bases of constitutional rule in the US: checks and balances among the three branches of government, and the rule of law. Americans use the word “democracy” as a shorthand to define their system. Yet democracy as Americans know it only functions when an independent judiciary monitors the executive and legislative branches. The relationship among the branches certainly changes over time, but an open attack by the executive upon the judiciary is something new – at least in the contemporary US. The president’s tweet recalls how authoritarianism has triumphed in other places. Modern tyrants grasp that their real target are rival institutions and legality, not voting as such. They often attack the judiciary first, assuming that the legislature will go along. Judges cannot, by the nature of their function, engage in populist media competitions. They must be protected by other judges, other institutions and popular opinion. If judges are left on their own, and the judiciary branch loses its independence, the legislative branch is next in line for humiliation and subjugation. Legislators have more access to the public sphere than judges, but less than the president. And if the judiciary is meaningless, the legislators, too, will soon lose their power. They can pass laws. But without independent judges whose verdicts are respected, those laws will mean only what the executive says they mean.\\nThese are not theoretical speculations, but descriptions of regime change as it is being effected throughout the western world before our eyes. The patterns in Russia, Hungary and Poland are different in significant ways, reflecting differences in the personalities of the leaders, the behavior of opposition, and concentrations of wealth. But the larger trend is difficult to miss: when judiciaries can be tamed, parliaments make themselves meaningless. Some lawmakers may do so from conviction, others from fear. But once the rule of law vanishes into distrust and the checks become unbalanced, the regime has changed. Voting may go on, but it means less and less. A number of Republican lawmakers have rightly criticized the president for the language of his tweet. Having done so, they might take a moment to mind these precedents. The defense of an independent judiciary is not only their obligation, it is in their best interest. An attack on a judge is an attack on the system, and in effect an attack on them. Chiding the president is not enough. The predominant sentiment among Republican legislators today seems to be in favor of passing desired laws now and dealing directly with Trump later. This could be a trap. Six months or a year from now, when all the laws have been passed, senators and representatives may find that they are no longer able, or willing, to resist the president. Timothy Snyder is professor of history at Yale University', 'Donald Trump has reportedly yelled down the telephone at Australia’s prime minister and veered off into rants about China and Nato with French leader François Hollande.\\nSo the leader of the world’s second largest economy, Xi Jinping, may feel he got off lightly with nothing more than a letter. Almost three weeks after Trump’s inauguration, that was how the US president decided to engage with his Chinese counterpart, in what observers described as a further indication of the dark clouds now gathering over US-China relations. In a statement, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump had used the missive to tell Xi he was looking forward to working with him “to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China”. Trump also wished the Chinese people a happy Year of the Rooster, although those tidings came almost a fortnight late.\\nEyebrows have been raised by the fact that Trump has not held a conversation with Xi since his inauguration, despite finding time to speak to at least 18 world leaders and post 112 tweets on his @realDonaldTrump account. “It’s a sign that bad times lie ahead in the US-China relationship,” said Nick Bisley, an international relations expert from La Trobe University in Melbourne. “China is very much being lined up by Trump’s people as not quite enemy number one but something approximating that.” Bisley said he believed Trump’s failure to line up a phone date with Xi was part of a deliberate ploy to annoy and publicly embarrass Beijing. “That’s just the way Trump likes things … This is not, ‘Oh, crap! We forgot about the Chinese!’ This is a considered cocking of the snook.” Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, rejected the suggestion that the lack of phone contact was a snub. “This kind of remark is meaningless,” said Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing, claiming that Trump’s holiday greetings had been “highly appreciated”. In a report released on Tuesday, some of the world’s leading China experts warned that the combination of Trump’s volatility and Xi’s increasingly aggressive and autocratic rule threatened to plunge already precarious US-China relations into a dangerous new era. Both before and after his shock election Trump has repeatedly signalled he will take a hard line with China, which he has accused of currency manipulation, militarising the South China Sea and not doing enough to help the US rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. In his campaign manifesto, Great Again: How To Fix Our Crippled America, the tycoon wrote: “There are people who wish I wouldn’t refer to China as our enemy. But that’s exactly what they are.” Trump’s letter to Xi follows a “congratulatory note” sent by the Chinese president to his US counterpart on the day of his 20 January inauguration. China’s foreign ministry has been coy about revealing the contents of Xi’s note, which was not widely reported in the Chinese media.\\nAsked to divulge Xi’s message to Trump, spokesperson Hua Chunying would say only that it had been a congratulatory note that had said congratulations. She declined to comment further. Chinese academics gave Trump’s letter a tepid reception. “It’s better than nothing, but it’s only a very small gesture,” Shi Yinhong, a Renmin University professor and government foreign policy adviser, told Bloomberg. Shi said Trump’s policy on China was still unclear but “all the signs so far point to a combative approach”. China specialists believe the US billionaire president and Xi, a member of China’s so-called red nobility, are unlikely to hit it off. In a recent interview, Winston Lord, Ronald Reagan’s former ambassador to Beijing, told the Guardian he believed it was essential for the US president to engage in continual one-on-one strategic discussions with China’s leader. But the veteran diplomat, who helped reestablish diplomatic relations with Mao’s China in the early 1970s, said he doubted such a relationship was possible “because Trump is not a reflective strategic thinker”. “Ideally, I would like the leaders to have this. But if it didn’t work out that well with someone as thoughtful and cerebral and strategic as Obama, I don’t know how it could possibly work out with Trump,” Lord said.', 'John Bercow spoke for Britain. If the government wishes to grant a state visit to the bigoted megalomaniac who currently inhabits the White House, that is technically its right. But the speaker has the right to intervene on who gets to address parliament. To coin a phrase, Speaker Bercow took back control. Last year’s victors in the EU referendum promised parliamentary sovereignty: they cannot object when it is now exercised. Given Bercow’s commendable efforts to combat sexism and racism in politics, it would have been hypocritical not to speak out. It is Bercow’s reasoning – that Donald Trump’s sexism, racism and attacks on the independence of the judiciary disqualify him from a parliamentary visit – that have led some to criticise the speaker for abandoning political neutrality. There is an important argument to be had here. Soon after Trump’s election, a senior broadcast news producer told me of his fears about the way in which the new president would be normalised. It included muddying the water on, say, what actually constitutes racism or sexism. Rather than reporting the president’s interventions as being racist or sexist, his comments would become merely “controversial”. And as such, the most powerful man on Earth would help send the fights against discrimination of various hues hurtling back decades, because it would become harder to identify it, let alone call it out. Trump has spoken about women in the most derogatory terms possible, has smeared Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, demanded a blanket ban on Muslims, and appointed as chief strategist the former editor of a far-right website. His sexism and racism are objective facts. The sky is blue, the Earth is round, Trump is a racist and a sexist. When we start arguing that his racism and sexism are open to debate, that to label him as such is to compromise objectivity, we strip both words of their meaning. This is already happening. The emboldened bigots of the western world believe they can speak and act with impunity, and nobody can challenge them on it. This must stop. If Theresa May believed that her attempts to turn Britain into a client state of Trump’s America would be smooth, she should have been less naive. The government is under pressure, it is on the defensive: exactly the moment to up the ante. On Thursday, the new Stop Trump coalition has its first open activists’ meeting to plan coming actions. When members of parliament debate Trump’s state visit – an honour some US presidents have never received – on 20 February, they will hear the voices of thousands of protesters outside. The British government is invaluable to Trump: May helps to normalise and legitimise him. That the speaker of the House of Commons called out Trump for what he is underlines that this is no normal president. The government didn’t have to humiliate Britain by trying to make this country Trump’s lapdog. It chose to, and now it is facing the consequences.', 'As thousands of demonstrators gathered at airports to protest Donald Trump’s travel ban, chefs across America gathered in their kitchens and dining rooms, alone and with staff, to strategize about what they could do to fight it. For many chefs and restaurant owners, the executive order is simply the latest in a sustained attack against their workforce and livelihood. It began in earnest with Trump’s assertion, last June, that Mexicans were drug dealers and rapists – although he did add that “some were good people”. But in the restaurant industry, immigrants aren’t just good people. They are necessary people. According to Saru Jayaraman, director of the Food Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-director of ROC United, an advocacy group for restaurant workers, the industry is the largest employer of immigrants in the country and the second-largest private sector employer overall. And it runs on immigrant labor, both documented and undocumented.\\nOf the 12 million employed in the restaurant industry, about 70% are foreign-born – this was based on a survey of restaurants in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles – and 1.3m are undocumented immigrants. They are dishwashers, line cooks, servers, bussers, chefs, sous chefs, bartenders, porters. Outside of the restaurants themselves, immigrants are farmers and truck drivers and field workers. Immigrants, too, are parents and grandparents to chefs, the hands that made the food that fed an incipient passion. “My restaurant was inspired by an immigrant and made possible by another,” says Francis Cretarola of Philadelphia’s Le Virtu, whose grandfather emigrated from Italy and inspired his Abruzzo-focused menu and whose Chinese mother-in-law provided the capital to open it. Cretarola’s story is common. Of Bon Appetit’s top 10 restaurants in the United States, at least five are either owned or co-owned by first-generation immigrants. Eight serve hyphenated cuisine, from Anglo-American to Italian-American to Filipino-American and one, South Philly Barbacoa, is co-owned and run by Cristina Martinez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, and her husband, Ben Miller. Without immigrants, not only would our larders would be impoverished, but our culinary imagination would be stale. So when Trump assumed office and yanked the national wheel hard to the right, chefs acted quickly. “The first thing I did after the election,” says Cretarola, “was to gather our staff – who are mostly from Puebla, Mexico – and let them know we are a family, that we have their backs.” Then he got to work. When the ban was announced, Cretarola began planning a dinner to raise money for a charity called the Popular Alliance for Undocumented Workers Rights (PAUWR), an organization founded by South Philly Barbacoa’s Martinez and Miller, through a series of dinners called Sanctuary Suppers. The next one, on 15 March, features the Italian-American food from Le Virtu with Pueblan dishes prepared by its sous chef, Poli Sanchez. Martinez and Miller, for their part, are rolling out their #Right2Work dinners across the country. In Indianapolis, when news of the ban hit, Martha Hoover, who runs 11 popular restaurants, made a large contribution to the Immigrant Welcome Center. In many ways, unlike her colleagues on the more blue coasts, Hoover is a battle-hardened veteran. WhenMike Pence was governor of the state, he attempted the passage of various anti-LGBT legislation with the alternative-fact title the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Hoover and her peers stood up then, using their restaurants for sit-ins and hosting fundraising dinners, and they are standing up now. “Here’s the thing about restaurants,” she explains. “We have a lot of people as employees who might live in the margins of society, whether they’re immigrants or making below minimum wage. It’s our opportunity to show by our actions to show we are a welcoming and inviting place for all.” Chefs, says Katherine Miller, president of the Chef Action Network, are uniquely suited to make a difference. “Restaurants have always been gathering spaces for the community,” she said, “so chefs have the ability to make a space at the table for everyone.” That’s the idea behind a new initiative called Sanctuary Restaurants, organized by ROC United and Presente.com. “It’s not a legal designation,” explains Jayaraman, “but it makes the statement that the restaurant is a safe space for all vulnerable populations.” (ROC United offers legal rapid-response assistance through another program.) Of the 200 restaurants participating in the program, many are in New York City, itself an avowed sanctuary city. The response, says Ken Friedman, whose restaurants such as the Breslin, the Spotted Pig and Salvation Taco display the “Sanctuary City” placards prominently, has been overwhelmingly positive.\\nBut elsewhere, in the heartland that is the America that voted for Trump, averring that the US is richer for its immigrants has real business consequences. Ben Hall runs Detroit’s Russell Street Deli. An early participant in the Sanctuary Restaurant program, he has spent the better part of two weeks responding to intensely negative blowback on Yelp and other fora. After being featured in an early Associated Press story, Hall says, “It’s been a shitshow.” Yet he’s never wavered in his commitment. “I grew up Catholic,” he said, “where ‘harboring the harborless’ is an act of corporal mercy. This isn’t a business decision. It’s a moral and ethical one.” Though Hall admits it is difficult to discuss these issues in the media or online, he says: “It has forced me and really allowed me to engage with our customers in a one-to-one way on the issue.”\\nOther chefs are still figuring out how to respond. Tom Colicchio, for instance, who is known both as the host of Bravo’s Top Chef and as the restaurateur behind Craft, says he keeps politics out of the workplace. “I’m responding to this as a citizen first,” he says, “not as a chef.” Though he is very active on Twitter, and behind-the-scenes with the Food Policy Action not-for-profit group, you won’t find any pièces de résistance on his menus. “It doesn’t have to be everywhere,” he says, of oft-divisive issues. On the other hand, David Chang, another celebrity chef, of Momofuku fame, is considering adding Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni and Iranian items to his menus. “I am frustrated and furious about what is happening,” he says, “and I’m frustrated with myself that I didn’t know about these cuisines either.” But he speaks for many chefs – especially celebrity chefs – when he says he doesn’t want to be seen as self-serving or somehow profiting from the activism. “I’m usually the loudest person in the room,” he says, “but I’m trying to be respectful because this is so serious an issue.”', 'They were up against a candidate that was beyond gaffe-prone. They had a huge money advantage. They had the support of almost every sector of capital, and what’s left of the labor movement, too. It was Hillary Clinton’s election to lose, and she still blew it. It seemed like some Democrats were finally understanding why. “If you want to appeal to the manufacturing worker in Scranton, the college student in Los Angeles and the single mom making minimum wage in Harlem, one economic message will work.” Those words were from Chuck Schumer, New York senator and savvy opportunist who’s been anything but a populist his entire political career. It’s a far cry from what he was saying before the election when he bragged: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.”\\nWe should question Schumer’s sincerity, but there is no doubt that after November commentators looked beyond Clinton’s deficiencies as a campaigner. They finally began to question the dominant Democratic party approach of offering little more to voters than a bit of inclusive rhetoric to go along with the neoliberal economics. Even at its height the Democratic party was always less coherent than the labor and social-democratic parties that reigned throughout Europe. In time, working-class interests were sucked into its tent, but much of the party’s agenda was always set – even during the height of the 1930s New Deal and 1960s Great Society programs – by allied business interests. It meant that the US never had an expansive welfare state even during the postwar golden age. And with the onset of capitalist crisis in the early 1970s, it made the social rollback that did happen even harder to guard against. The Democratic party had to reinvent itself: it could no longer deliver material goods to workers, so instead it presented itself as a less vicious option than Republicans and a force that would play a role offering representational gains to oppressed groups – black people, women, the LGBT community and others. Clinton’s campaign represented the height of this strategy, as she both scoffed at $15 minimum wage proposals and embraced the academic rhetoric of “intersectionality”.\\nYet for a brief moment an alternative flowered even within the Democratic party. In the beginning, the Bernie Sanders campaign seemed little more than a protest candidacy – his first press conference was a sloppy affair on Capitol Hill, attended by no more than a handful of bored reporters. But the campaign quickly attracted mass support, drawing tens of thousands to rallies and winning almost 13 million votes. Like Trump, and decidedly unlike Clinton, Sanders was able to speak to the anger simmering among many Americans, including white workers who had seen their living standards decline, without even the limited social and cultural gains other members of the Democratic coalition could point to. Though Sanders was the most left-wing major candidate the Democrats had ever had, he won over independent and self-described “moderate” voters turned off by the party. Bernie’s rhetoric was fiery, he attacked greedy “millionaires and billionaires” and put their actions and sway over policymakers at the center of a narrative of working-class suffering. But the Sanders Democrat platform was, in truth, fairly moderate. It called for the universal provision of some basic social goods and a reevaluation of trade deals as a part of a return to the shared prosperity of the postwar period. It was telling that for selling this modest dream Sanders was portrayed as a wild-eyed radical by Democratic elites. For almost every quarter of the party’s leadership, these reforms were unpalatable. Every segment of the Democratic nomenklatura – from the remnants of the Democratic Leader Council to even the lion’s share of the labor bureaucracy and the Congressional Black Caucus – opposed Sanders. They didn’t need direct orders from the Democratic National Committee to know not to run astray from the donor class and corporate interests that kept them in business. The party had a strategy: it would win over moderate Republican voters in suburbs and convince most segments of capital to back them over the erratic Trump. The second party of capital wanted to once again prove itself to be the most responsible choice.\\nClinton’s messaging was molded along these lines. Whereas Trump spoke confidently about his tremendous plans to “make America great again”, Clinton focused on running defensively, against Trump, not for a vision of a better deal for ordinary people. “Love trumps hate” was her confused final statement. For enough Americans who hate politicians and haven’t thought very highly of the past 30 years, voting for someone whose main pitch was that they had been in politics for 30 years was a predictably hard sell. The Sanders Democrats, then, seem vindicated by November’s results, but their efforts to take over the Democratic party haven’t exactly gone as planned. In the days following the election, the narrative seemed to swing in their favor. With an emphasis that perhaps overstated just how many white workers swung to Trump, the media asked how the Democrats had lost the rust belt. Others noted that even black and Latino workers turned out in far fewer numbers for Clinton than Obama. For many, Sanders’ failed campaign seemed to be a blueprint for what the party should look like in 2018 and 2020. New scapegoats quickly emerged, however. The alleged inexorable racism and sexism of American voters was, of course, cited. But then also was the role of Russia, fake news and the FBI. These factors, even the blame put on Clinton’s personal abilities as a campaigner, distracted from the overarching need for a new direction. Some were even as hyperbolic as liberal commentator Keith Olbermann, who announced that “We are the victims of a Russian coup.” Of course, Putin’s actions here, in Russia, and abroad are worth plenty of condemnation. But the influence of Russia in the election was likely far less than the role played by any other actor in the United States: large transnational business interests, the media, even progressive groups like labor unions. It should never have been a close election to begin with, but still the unthinkable happened. And the longer we keep blaming the ignorance of voters or foreign machinations, the better chance we have it happening again in 2020. The problem with our democracy isn’t the threat of foreign intervention – it’s that voters were given a choice between two candidates that didn’t represent their interests. Enough of them, rationally enough, decided to stay at home or try their chances on a buffoonish outsider. It’s time the Democrats either decide to offer something else on the menu or go out of business.', 'On Friday and Saturday, after the release of an 11-year-old recording that revealed Donald Trump boasting about his advances on a married woman and his desire to “grab [women] by the pussy”, a succession of Republican lawmakers condemned the remarks and in some cases withdrew their support for their party’s presidential nominee.\\nHere is a list of those Republicans and their current statements and positions regarding Trump, in context of what they have previously said on the subject. Republicans who have endorsed and now abandoned Trump John Thune, South Dakota senator and third-ranking Republican in the Senate: “Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.” In May, Thune argued Trump was a necessary candidate of “change”, saying: “We have to get it right in 2016 because the future of our country is hanging in the balance in so many different ways. And there are three words that ought to scare everyone in this room: President Hillary Clinton.” John McCain, Arizona senator and 2008 presidential nominee: “I have wanted to support the candidate our party nominated. He was not my choice, but as a past nominee, I thought it important I respect the fact that Donald Trump won a majority of the delegates by the rules our party set. I thought I owed his supporters that deference. “But Donald Trump’s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts of sexual assaults, make it impossible to offer even conditional support for his candidacy … We will write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president.” Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire senator: “I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women.” Last week, Ayotte called Trump a “role model” and then promptly recanted the remark, saying neither he nor Hillary Clinton were worthy of admiration. Jason Chaffetz, Utah representative: “I’m pulling my endorsement. I cannot support in any way, shape or form the comments or approach Donald Trump has taken.” This summer, after some public struggle, Chaffetz said he would support the nominee. Bradley Byrne, Alabama representative: “It is now clear Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States and cannot defeat Hillary Clinton. I believe he should step aside.” Gary Herbert, Utah governor: “Donald Trump’s statements are beyond offensive & despicable. While I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump.” Dennis Daugaard, South Dakota governor: “Enough is enough. Donald Trump should withdraw in favor of Governor Mike Pence. This election is too important.”\\nJoe Heck, Nevada representative: “I can no longer look past the pattern of behavior and comments that have been made by Donald Trump. Therefore, I cannot in good conscience continue to support Donald Trump, nor can I vote for Hillary Clinton.” Mike Crapo, Idaho senator: “His repeated actions and comments toward women have been disrespectful, profane and demeaning.” Deb Fischer, Nebraska representative: “It would be wise for him to step aside and allow Mike Pence to serve as our party’s nominee.” Lisa Murkowski, Alaska senator: “I cannot and will not support Donald Trump for president. He has forfeited the right to be our party’s nominee.” Dan Sullivan, Alaska senator: “I’m calling on Trump to step aside for Gov. Pence. Trump can’t lead on critical issue of ending dom violence & sexual assault.” Ann Wagner, Missouri representative: “I must be true to those survivors and myself condemn the predatory and reprehensible comments of Donald Trump. I withdraw my endorsement and call for Governor Pence to take the lead so we can defeat Hillary Clinton.” Brian Sandoval, Nevada governor: “This video exposed not just words, but now an established pattern which I find to be repulsive and unacceptable for a candidate for president of the United States. I cannot support him as my party’s nominee. Martha Roby, Alabama Representative: “Donald Trump’s behavior makes him unacceptable as a candidate for president, and I won’t vote for him.” Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia senator: “Women have worked hard to gain the dignity and respect we deserve. The appropriate next step may be for him to re-examine his candidacy.” Cory Gardner, Colorado senator: “If Donald Trump wishes to defeat Hillary Clinton, he should do the only thing that will allow us to do so – step aside.” Tom Rooney, Florida representative: “If I support him for president, I will be telling my boys that I think it’s OK to treat women like objects – and I’ll have failed as a dad. Therefore, I can no longer support Donald Trump for president and will not be voting for him or Hillary Clinton.” Frank LoBiondo, New Jersey representative: “I will not vote for a candidate who boasts of sexual assault. It is my conclusion that Mr Trump is unfit to be President.” John Boozman, Arkansas senator: “If I ever heard anyone speak this way about [my daughters and granddaughters] they would be shopping for a new set of teeth … I am focused on saving the US Senate.” Rodney Davis, Illinois representative: “The abhorrent comments made by Donald Trump are inexcusable and go directly against what I’ve been doing in Washington to combat assaults on college campuses. Because of this, I am rescinding my support for Donald Trump.” Rob Portman, Ohio senator: “While I continue to respect those who still support Donald Trump, I can no longer support him. I continue to believe our country cannot afford a Hillary Clinton presidency. I will be voting for Mike Pence for President.” (Portman did not disavow Trump in his initial statement Friday night.) Nevada representative Cresent Hardy, Utah representative Chris Stewart, and Nebraska representative Jeff Fortenberry have also rescinded their support of Trump but not released statements. Republicans who condemned remarks but still officially support Trump Mike Pence, Indiana governor and Trump’s running mate: “I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. I am grateful that he has expressed remorse … we pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.” Paul Ryan, speaker of the House and most powerful Republican in Washington: “I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.” Mitch McConnell, Kentucky senator and Senate majority leader: “As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.” Ted Cruz, Texas senator and failed presidential candidate: “These comments are disturbing and inappropriate. There is simply no excuse for them. Every wife, mother, daughter – every person – deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. Marco Rubio, Florida senator and failed presidential candidate: “Donald’s comments were vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify. No one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private.” Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” Rand Paul, Kentucky senator and failed presidential candidate: “His comments are offensive and unacceptable.” Bob Dole, former senator from Kansas and 1996 presidential nominee: “It was 11 years ago. He shouldn’t have said it, but there’s nothing he can do about it except to do well in the debate.” Joni Ernst, Iowa senator: “The comments DJT [Donald J Trump] made are lewd & insulting. There is no excuse, and no room for such reprehensible and objectifying talk about anyone, ever.” Bob Corker, Tennessee senator and chair of the foreign relations committee: “These comments are obviously very inappropriate and offensive and his apology was absolutely necessary.” Richard Burr, North Carolina senator and Trump national security adviser: “I am going to watch his level of contrition over the next few days to determine my level of support.” Jon Cornyn, Texas senator: “I am disgusted by Mr Trump’s words about women: our daughters, sisters and mothers. Phil Bryant, Mississippi governor: “Donald Trump’s remarks are unacceptable … They do not square with the man I have gotten to know the past few months. He has done the right thing and apologized.” Ryan Zinke, Montana representative: “The language is shocking and wrong and should never be used ever. Lola and I have talked about it and we pray he has grown from this mistake.” Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas governor: “While he has acknowledged it as wrong and apologized, it is important that he demonstrate in the debate on Sunday and in the future that he understands and respects the value of women.” Chris Collins, New York representative: “There is no change in my support of Mr. Trump as our nominee because he remains the only candidate who will bring our jobs back, secure our borders and stand up to our enemies.” Dan Coats, Indiana senator: “Donald Trump’s vulgar comments are totally inappropriate and disgusting, and these words have no place in our society.” Greg Abbott, governor of Texas: “Deeply disturbing rhetoric by Trump. An insult to all women & contrary to GOP values. Absent true contrition, consequences will be dire.” Republicans who have never supported Trump\\nJohn Kasich, Ohio governor and failed presidential candidate: “Nothing that has happened in the last 48 hours is surprising to me or many others … It’s clear that he hasn’t changed and has no interest in doing so. As a result, Donald Trump is a man I cannot and should not support. The actions of the last day are disgusting.” Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts and 2012 presidential nominee: “Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world.” Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and failed presidential candidate: “As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.” Ben Sasse, Nebraska senator: “Character matters. @realDonaldTrump is obviously not going to win. But he can still make an honorable move: Step aside & let Mike Pence try.” Susan Collins, Maine senator: “It was comments like these, including the statements he made about John McCain, a disabled reporter, the family of a fallen soldier and more, that caused me to decide this summer that I could not support his candidacy.” Mike Lee, Utah senator : “Your conduct, sir, is the distraction … I respectfully ask you, with all due respect, to step aside. Step down. Allow someone else to carry the banner of these principles.” Mark Kirk, Illinois senator: “DJT [Donald J Trump] is a malignant clown – unprepared and unfit to be president of the United States.” Jeff Flake, Arizona senator: “America deserves far better than @realDonaldTrump.” Arnold Schwarzenegger, former governor of California: “For the first time since I became a citizen in 1983, I will not vote for the Republican candidate for president. Like many Americans, I’ve been conflicted by this election – I still haven’t made up my mind about how exactly I will vote next month … But as proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that I hold above all else – American. So I want to take a moment today to remind my fellow Republicans that it is not only acceptable to choose your country over your party – it is your duty.” Mia Love, Utah representative: “Mr Trump has yet to clear that bar and his behavior and bravado have reached a new low. I cannot vote for him.” Mike Coffman, Colorado representative: “For the good of the country, and to give Republicans a chance of defeating Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump should step aside.” Fred Upton, Michigan representative: “I urge him to think about our country over his own candidacy and carefully consider stepping aside from the ticket.” Erik Paulsen, Minnesota representative: “For months I have said Donald Trump has not earned my vote. The disgusting statements revealed last night make it clear he cannot. I will not be voting for him.” Justin Amash, Michigan representative: “Character matters. @realDonaldTrump has been saying outrageous, offensive things the whole time. He should have stepped aside long ago.”\\nPat Tiberi, Ohio representative: “Donald Trump’s comments and behavior were reprehensible, vulgar and extremely disrespectful. He was not my choice for our nominee and I never endorsed him. I have always said that I want to see a positive message and winnable strategy against Hillary Clinton from the Republican nominee. It is disappointing, especially for Americans who are looking for real leadership and integrity in their presidential candidate, that Trump has not been able to clear that bar. Americans deserve better choices for the highest office in the land. Trump should consider stepping aside. Otherwise, this will continue to consume the remainder of the campaign and help Clinton become the next president.” Never committed for or against Trump Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania senator: “Donald Trump’s comments were outrageous and unacceptable.” Rob Portman, Ohio Senator: “As I said yesterday, Donald Trump’s comments were offensive and wrong. I had hoped to support the candidate my party nominated in the primary process. I thought it was appropriate to respect the millions of voters across the country who chose Donald Trump as the Republican Party nominee. While I continue to respect those who still support Donald Trump, I can no longer support him. I continue to believe our country cannot afford a Hillary Clinton presidency. I will be voting for Mike Pence for President.” Barbara Comstock, Virginia representative: “No woman should ever be subjected to this type of obscene behavior and it is unbecoming of anybody seeking high office. In light of these comments, Donald Trump should step aside.” Will Hurd, Texas representative: “I never endorsed Trump and I cannot in good conscience support or vote for a man who degrades women, insults minorities and has no clear path to keep our country safe.” Condoleezza Rice, George W Bush’s secretary of state: “Enough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw.” Susana Martinez, New Mexico governor: “That’s why I have withheld my support from the very beginning, and will not support him now.” Bill Haslam, Tennessee governor: “I want to emphasize that character in our leaders does matter.…It is time for the good of the nation and the Republican Party for Donald Trump to step aside.” Kay Granger, Texas representative: “Watching that video is disgusting. Mr Trump should remove himself from consideration as commander in chief.”', 'As anxious as I am about the future of the free world, it tickles me to imagine the clocks standing still in the Republican National Committee (RNC) as it considered the new dimensions of Donald Trump’s character. If he had just had the odd conversation in which women over 35 were obsolete and his daughter was a piece of ass, would that have been OK? If he had only ranted on Twitter at two in the morning about a woman’s bodyweight, if he had merely revealed his sponsorship of the Miss World contest as a chimp-narcissist’s vision of the globe’s best strip show, staged for his eyes only, would he have gotten away with it? Impossible to tell, since his taped boast that he liked to “grab women by the pussy”, and owing to his fame could do so without consequence, dwarfed the lot: the Victory Project at the RNC, devoted to the election of Trump, was stopped. “Please put on hold/stop all mail projects right now,” ran the instruction. “If something is in production or print, it needs to stop.” They caught a glimpse of the history they’d be writing, and decided winning wasn’t for them.\\nWhy is this the red line? After all the depressingly egregious things he’s said, how did the pussy trump the wall? If there’s one thing we knew already, it was that Trump has an instrumental view of the world, in which other people hold no interest or value beyond what they can supply to him: Mexicans, cheap labour; women, sex; Muslims, a ready enemy. Once these functions are no longer optimally performed, the people become worse than useless, parasitic, despicable. The simple reading is that women constitute a voting bloc in which a very large number have been sexually assaulted and not one of them took that as a good thing. There is space within the territory of abortion for paradox, a dualism between the personal and the political that makes it possible to be violently pro-life having had an abortion, given the classic Republican framing of hating the sin and not the sinner, castigating the doctor and not the patient. Trump’s deviation – that the women themselves seeking termination deserved “some form of punishment” – was too much for many, and 38% of Republican-voting women said he would make a bad president afterwards. But it wasn’t too much for everyone – the stubborn majority of female Republicans, some of whom must by statistical necessity have had terminations themselves, remained supportive of his presidency.\\nThe misogyny revealed on these tapes (and a former producer of the Apprentice promises we ain’t seen nothing yet) is a new category: broad, sneering, violent, encompassing every woman unprotected by her age or ugliness, it is a particular cocktail of revulsion, contempt and savagery, a world in which women retain a power that seems contradictory – if we’re so worthless, why is it important and/or enjoyable to subjugate us? – until you realise that the enjoyment of humiliation is its own psychic world and has no more logic than love does. The political energy unleashed by this is anger. It’s powerful, and it enters a context in which to respect rage is a badge both of nous and sincerity, as we’ve seen in the court paid to it post-Brexit vote. Yet there is another aspect to the disgrace, without which I wouldn’t trust the camel’s back to break. It puts Trump in the realm of the irredeemable. Until now, he occupied that particular spot as the pre-redemption character in a feelgood movie. Maybe he was racist because his jet-set lifestyle had never supplied him any Mexican or Muslim friends; he was sheltered, but one day, like Clint Eastwood in the movie Gran Torino, he would move in next door to a family of immigrants, and realise they were just as hard-working as he was. Or his daughter would have an unwanted pregnancy, and he would realise that life was complicated. Some collision would occur between his worldview and the world, and he would be forced to\\xa0re-evaluate.\\nThere is, however, no shortage of women in Trump’s life; he has daughters and wives, employees and adversaries, a mother at one point, and yet nothing – in all that contact, over all those decades – has led him to think of us as people; nothing has shaken his conviction that we’re a different species, to serve a purpose, whose personal and intellectual attributes are no more important than those of a horse. There is no story arc for this man, no journey; he can get no better, and we already knew that he could get no worse. So his narrative is broken. He can no longer be the anti-hero of his own film; he can only be the villain in somebody else’s. If this is the end of Trump, that will be boon enough. But there are wider lessons here, for we’ve now seen what happens to politics when its agents excise, despise or for any other reason fail to recognise the female point of view. This is apparent not just in Trump’s excesses, but in the idiocy of the Brexit debate, its lunkheaded machismo studded with the fictions that become necessary when your authority has no basis. Our own Nigel Farage is, of course, a link between this kind of politics on both sides of the Atlantic and as chief British cheerleader for Trump, he mounted a spirited defence of his soulmate this weekend. “He’s not running for pope, he’s running for president,” he said and that revealed much, not least that to Farage, treating women as something other than meat is piety sufficient for sainthood. There was another message too, that those roles are men’s by definition.\\nI have always rejected the idea that a female point of view even exists in politics, for three reasons. First, just because we’re women doesn’t mean we all agree; and the suggestion that we should is a textbook and profound political sexism of its own, rendering us less by denying us the freedom to individuate. Second, a conception of “women’s politics” always takes as its starting point a demand for equality, and it makes no rational sense to limit that demand to equality between genders. There is no inequality between genders that isn’t interlaced with inequalities of wealth, race and power, or if there is, it’s not the most pressing. Third, the debating terms, when you talk about “female issues” often carry underlying prescriptions about how women should behave, which are themselves regressive and uninspiring. You can make the argument, forcefully, and on very solid turf, that any contraction of the state – be that in social care or services or public sector pay – will always fall disproportionately upon women, as they take up the burdens of care that the state once shouldered. While it may be true, that narrative isn’t galvanising; I don’t want to build a generous state on feminist grounds because I, by my nature, would otherwise spend my life mopping, tending and wiping. I reject care as a gendered activity. Nevertheless, everywhere, I see the potential for unleashing a female solidarity that could cut through turgid certainties and redraw ideological fault lines. Freedom from violence and reproductive autonomy are good muster points but don’t go far enough. A constant eye on the future, a calm insistence that not everything of value can be counted, a love of international cooperation and respect for the institutions it has created, a knowledge that some things are too important to be left to the market, an empathy with the dispossessed: there is nothing essentially female about these ideas, yet where no women are, you never hear them. In the vacuum, you hear Trump and others like him. To regretfully borrow the phrase of Sheryl Sandberg, it really is time to lean in.', 'Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee for US president, has become the latest senior figure in the party to withdraw his endorsement of Donald Trump as more of the candidate’s offensive comments about women were aired in the US.\\nThe Arizona senator issued a statement declaring it “impossible to continue to offer even conditional support” for Trump, in the wake of leaked video and audio showing Trump boasting about making sexual advances toward women without their consent. “Cindy and I will not vote for Donald Trump,” McCain said in a statement that included his wife. “I have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate and we will not vote for Hillary Clinton. We will write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president.” Shortly after McCain released his statement, Trump made a surprise appearance outside Trump Tower in New York City. Early on Saturday evening, the billionaire emerged from his skyscraper, where he had been in crisis talks and debate preparation all day, to greet a group of 100 ardent supporters who had been demonstrating outside the building since morning. Trump shook his fist in the air, waved and pointed, without saying anything. He then went quickly back into the building. His appearance raised a huge commotion among those gathered on Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan, prompting cheers and chants of “Trump for president” and “USA! USA!”\\nOne onlooker, Karen Stecher from Windsor, Canada, said: “It’s ridiculous. I’ve seen a crowd react to a star in LA but it wasn’t like this. This is like entertainment but it’s scary because of the anger and aggression.” The appearance came as it emerged Trump had made similarly crude comments about his relationships with women in a series of interviews with the US “shock jock” Howard Stern. The Republican candidate reportedly bragged about sleeping with 24-year-olds, described a woman reaching the age of 35 as “checkout time” and described his daughter Ivanka as having “always been very voluptuous”. On Saturday afternoon Trump’s wife, Melania, released a statement in which she said Trump’s comments in conversation with the Access Hollywood presenter Billy Bush were offensive but asked the American people to see that her husband had “the heart and mind of a leader”. Reached with a request for comment about the mounting controversy surrounding her father’s campaign, Ivanka Trump hung up on the Guardian. McCain, locked in a tough re-election battle in Arizona, condemned Trump’s comments after the release of the 11-year-old Access Hollywood recording on Friday but initially stopped short of rescinding his endorsement. As leading Republican officials launched an exodus from Trump in the 24 hours that followed, he faced quickly mounting pressure.\\nIn his statement on Saturday, he said he had “wanted to support the candidate our party nominated” and respect the Republican primary process. “He was not my choice, but as a past nominee I thought it important I respect the fact that Donald Trump won a majority of the delegates by the rules our party set. I thought I owed his supporters that deference,” McCain wrote. McCain’s Senate race could determine whether the Republican party maintains its precarious control of the chamber. Other Republicans who disavowed their support for Trump on Saturday included Senate candidates Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Rob Portman of Ohio, and Joe Heck of Nevada. Some Republicans formally called on Trump to step aside and allow his running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, to become the party’s standard-bearer with just 30 days left until election day. Such voices included John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate. Democrats swiftly rejected the desertion of Trump by those who had endorsed him as political calculation – pointing out that Republicans had stood by the former reality TV star even as he disparaged Mexican immigrants, Muslims, prisoners of war, the disabled and the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero and repeatedly made crude statements about women. “McCain made it clear a long time ago: he is no longer a straight-talking maverick,” Ann Kirkpatrick, the Democratic congresswoman challenging McCain for his seat, said in a statement. “He missed the chance to show political courage and lead. He failed that test. Now, it’s too late, John McCain. The people of Arizona deserve better.”\\nMcCain was the first prominent Republican to criticize Trump’s continued insistence that the Central Park Five, five young African Americans wrongfully convicted of rape in New York City in 1989, were guilty. Despite the fact that the men’s convictions were overturned by DNA evidence, Trump insisted on Friday that the five, whom he called for to be executed at the time, were still guilty, pointing out to CNN that the youths confessed at the time. Trump did not mention that they were beaten by police and that New York City paid a $41m settlement.\\nOn Saturday, Pence seemed to leave the crisis entirely in Trump’s hands. In a statement, Pence said: “As a husband and father I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the 11-year-old video released yesterday. “I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. I am grateful that he has expressed remorse.” Pence seemed to suggest that much would depend on Trump’s performance in the second presidential debate, scheduled for Sunday in St Louis. “We pray for his family,” he said, “and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.” Paul Ryan addressed a crowd at a Republican event in Wisconsin, to boos and heckles from Trump supporters. The nominee had been invited to attend by the House speaker but in the wake of the controversy on Friday, Ryan rescinded this invitation. On Saturday Ryan took to the stage, saying “there is a bit of an elephant in the room”. He then referenced his statement on the issue, in which he said he was “sickened” by Trump’s remarks, before making clear “that’s not what we are here to talk about today”. The Clinton campaign remained silent throughout the day. The Democratic nominee will address the issue at Sunday’s presidential debate, a campaign official told the Guardian, as that forum will provide her with the largest possible audience.\\nThe thinking within Clinton’s campaign was to let Trump suffer the repercussions of being unendorsed en masse by members of his own party. Surrogates for the former secretary of state were also encouraged to temper their responses. Clinton’s team was also certain Trump would remain the Republican nominee, the official said, it being too late to remove him from the ballot. The campaign has not yet shifted its resources in light of the leaked video and plans to move forward with the same battleground plan. In Manhattan, Trump’s appearance outside Trump Tower drew enthusiastic responses from the nominee’s supporters. One, Joseph Conigliaro, said: “I was excited to see him. He came out of nowhere! Everyone was screaming. “He made those comments when he was a businessman and a TV star. They mean nothing. People say a lot of things in private they wouldn’t say in public running for office. It’s freedom of speech. We weren’t paying him. He was in business.” Another supporter, Anne \\u200eMcLain, said: “I felt so excited. I appreciate it. I called him Mr President. He’s going to build a wall to look after our national security. He loves women. Regardless of what he said in a bar 10 years ago.”', 'As the anti-Trump resistance movement finds its feet after a dizzying first 11 days, it’s hard not to notice how well women are playing offence. I can think of no more perfect distillation of Trump’s presidency than German chancellor Angela Merkel explaining the Geneva convention to him over the phone after he attempted to alpha-male his way past it. Of course, the world’s most extravagantly unqualified man – who was only able to defeat his peerlessly qualified female opponent through a combination of voter suppression, weaponised misogyny, Russian propaganda and a constitutional technicality, and still managed to lose by 3m votes – had to receive on-the-job training, pro bono, from a female world leader. A statement from Merkel’s spokesman explained, with bone-dry reserve: “The … refugee convention requires the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds. All signatory states are obligated to do [so]. The German government explained this policy in their call yesterday.” It’s a markedly female kind of jab – as many of my gender have learned by now, it’s sometimes more effective (and safer) to disguise your contempt as a helping hand. Speaking of helping hands, Theresa May gifted us the only reason to laugh this week (aside from the Clickhole headline “A new intimidation tactic: Sean Spicer is wearing a suit three sizes too small and drinking water from a thimble to make the press think he is growing”). A photograph of Trump clutching May’s hand while descending a small ramp during the pair’s meeting this week inspired the unproven but compelling suggestion that the US president might be afraid to walk down slopes and stairs, like a cow. According to a “senior government source” who spoke to the Daily Mail, Trump “hates heights where you can see the ground or sharp inclines”. May’s office wrote off the handholding as a “chivalrous gesture”, but remained suspiciously silent on whether or not Trump’s knees bend the wrong way. But rumours, humiliation and stairs are the least of Trump’s woman problems right now. Federal judge Ann Donnelly, United States district court judge Allison Burroughs and US magistrate judge Gail Dein all signed orders to temporarily block Trump’s unconstitutional anti-Muslim travel ban. Sally Yates, as acting attorney general, refused to defend Trump’s ban in court and was subsequently fired for “betrayal”, establishing her as a national hero and Trump as openly hostile to the constitution. Sharp-eyed wonks quickly circulated a video from Yates’s 2015 confirmation hearing in which none other than Senator Jeff Sessions – Trump’s attorney general pick – lectured her on the importance of saying “no” to the president if he attempts to execute something “improper” or “unlawful”. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was the only member of the senate to fight all but one of Trump’s cabinet nominees (Nikki Haley), sparking some frisson about a potential 2020 presidential run. Representative Maxine Waters, who began calling for Trump’s impeachment before he was even inaugurated, said this week: “The people are not going to take this new president who thinks he’s a dictator.” At a rally in Boston, Senator Elizabeth Warren declared: “Little girls who flee murderers are not a threat to the US.” Republican senator Susan Collins said that “religious tests … run contrary to our American values”. This list is not even close to exhaustive. Behind it all loomed the spectre of the global, record-smashing Women’s March, which clearly still torments Trump – partly because his inauguration was a wake by comparison, and partly because the march’s energy and momentum don’t appear to have waned in the slightest. The airport protests that sprang up this weekend were spontaneous, potent and, in their way, joyous – people, even those new to protesting, were ready to move at a moment’s notice to protect their neighbours from tyranny. Of course, there’s been blistering dissent from men too, and robust leadership is blooming in every marginalised group that the president has announced plans to brutalise. But there’s something poetically satisfying about the first judicial and legislative blows to Trump’s regime coming from a group whose power he so plainly underestimates. The president’s disdain for women feels faintly\\xa0more personal than some of his more perfunctory bigotries (though no more destructive): he has clearly spent his entire life treating us as furniture, sex holes, trophies or trash. He doesn’t just want to restrict our constitutional rights; he wants to put his hand on our genitals and squeeze. He didn’t realise we had the power to squeeze back, and that oversight will hurt him. Hope is thin on the ground for those of us who care not to trade democracy for white-supremacist kleptocracy, but three ideas have been keeping me upright: we are all still here, there are more of us and we are not going back. The Trumpists will attempt to drag us backwards legislatively, but socially it’s not so easy. You cannot force millions of gay and trans people back in the closet. You cannot make women forget what it feels like to have careers, to thrive and excel, to earn money and choose our own futures. You cannot turn us back into incubators once we have almost been the president. That\\xa0doesn’t mean we can’t lose – but it does\\xa0mean we won’t quit.', 'This article was originally published on 20 July 2016. A woman at the centre of sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump has spoken for the first time in detail about her personal experience with the billionaire tycoon who this week became the Republican nominee for president. Jill Harth, a makeup artist, has stayed quiet for almost 20 years about the way Trump pursued her, and – according to a lawsuit she instigated – cornered her and groped her in his daughter’s bedroom. After Trump mounted his campaign for the White House, details emerged of the 1997 complaint, in which Harth accused him of “attempted ‘rape’”. She said she was quickly inundated with interview requests from major US television networks, but resolved not to speak about the events – until Trump publicly said in May that her claims were “meritless” and his daughter Ivanka gave an interview in which she said her father was “not a groper”. Harth, who feels she has been publicly branded a liar and believes her business has suffered because of her association with the allegations, decided to speak out about her experience with Trump because she wants an apology.\\nIn an hour-long interview at the Guardian’s New York office on Tuesday, Harth said she stands by her charges against Trump, which run from low-grade sexual harassment to an episode her lawyers described in the lawsuit as “attempted ‘rape’”. She first met Trump in December 1992 at his offices in Trump Tower, where she and her then romantic partner, George Houraney, were making a business presentation. The couple wanted to recruit Trump to back their American Dream festival, in which Harth oversaw a pin-up competition known as American Dream Calendar Girls. Harth described that meeting as “the highlight of our career”. But in other ways, it was something of a lowlight: Trump took an interest in Harth immediately and began subjecting her to a steady string of unwanted sexual advances, detailed by Harth in her complaint. There was the initial leering in that first December meeting in Trump Tower, and the inappropriate questions after her relationship status. It continued the next night over dinner at the Plaza Hotel’s Oak Room, where at a dinner with beauty pageant contestants she alleges he groped her under the table. It culminated in January 1993, when Harth and Houraney were visiting his Florida mansion, Mar-a-Lago, to finalize and then celebrate the beauty pageant deal with a party. After business concluded, Harth and Houraney were on tour of Mar-a-Lago along with a group of young pageant contestants – Trump wanted to “see the quality of the girls he was sponsoring”, Harth recalled – when he pulled her aside into one of the children’s bedrooms. “He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again,” Harth said, “and I had to physically say: ‘What are you doing? Stop it.’ It was a shocking thing to have him do this because he knew I was with George, he knew they were in the next room. And how could he be doing this when I’m there for business?”\\nSpeaking as Republicans gathered in Cleveland to formally declare Trump as the party’s candidate in the November general election, Harth said she had been very reluctant to talk after the sexual assault allegations resurfaced, “because honestly, it was painful for me to have to do it again. It was stressful, it gave me anxiety, it definitely wounded my marriage – it wasn’t the death knell, but it wounded it, it was stressful having to handle this.” She recalled how Trump – who had just gone through a divorce from his first wife, Ivana, and was in a relationship with Marla Maples, who would become his second wife – pursued her and urged her to leave Houraney. “Trump did everything in his power to get me to leave him. He constantly called me and said: ‘I love you, baby, I’m going to be the best lover you ever had. What are you doing with that loser, you need to be with me, you need to step it up to the big leagues.’ “He was constantly working on me during that time and that took a toll on me. But I moved on. I’m a forgiving type person, OK? I’m a Christian, I moved on.” ‘They tried to get me to say it never happened’ Trump’s decision to run for president brought the question to the fore for her once more. And initially, she said she was inclined to let bygones be bygones. She concedes she even found herself getting excited at the thought that someone she knew so well was running for president. A recent Trump rally she attended seemed to confirm her decision to lie low. “‘Don’t worry about it,’ I said, ‘I’m not going to say anything bad, we’ve moved on, we’re friendly,’” Harth recalled in her interview with the Guardian. When Trump thanked her and gave her a hug, she thought he wouldn’t say anything either. The interaction, Harth said, reaffirmed her decision to stay quiet. That is, until she saw Trump dismiss media reports referencing her case as “meritless”, or worse. After the New York Times ran a story in May this year about Trump’s history with women, including an account of Harth’s story, Trump’s campaign even reached out to her to pressure her to take back her account, she told the Guardian on Tuesday. “His office – and I have it on my voicemails that he called, that they called – they asked me to recant everything when the New York Times article came out. They were trying to get me to say it never happened and I made it up. And I said I’m not doing that,” she recalled. Trump’s office denied this. She was further upset by an interview Trump’s daughter Ivanka gave in the wake of the New York Times article saying her dad is “not a groper”.\\n“I understand that the girl wanted to defend her dad, being it’s her dad,” she said, “but what did she know? She was 10 years old! She was 10 years old at the time. She didn’t know what her father was about, what he was doing, how he was acting.” Such statements felt defamatory to Harth, adding insult to injury. That’s when she hired attorney Lisa Bloom to demand that Trump retract his statements that are, as Bloom put it, “effectively calling her a liar”. “Jill is very clear that she is not a liar,” Bloom said. “And her reputation is important to her. And her living a life free of this kind of stress is important to her. So we’re calling on not only Mr Trump, Ivanka Trump, too.” The renewed controversy comes as Trump prepares to give his keynote speech in Cleveland on Thursday. It also comes as Roger Ailes, the chairman and CEO of Trump-friendly Fox News, is in the process of being ousted following a sexual harassment suit filed by a former anchor.\\nWhen Trump’s office was asked to respond to Harth’s allegations, they highlighted her inconsistency about her views on Trump, forwarding emails from 2015 and as recently as January 2016 in which she expressed friendly feelings about Trump and even asked about a job helping to do his campaign trail makeup. As Harth wrote in an August 2015 email forwarded by Trump’s campaign: “I also would like to show my support for Donald and his campaign. I am offering my services to do his grooming and getting him perfectly camera ready for photos and Hi-Definition TV. He knows better than anybody how important image is.” In another email from October 2015, she praised Trump for “doing a tremendous job of shaking things up in the United States” and added: “I am definitely Team Trump!” Harth said those emails were written months before Trump called her integrity into question. She also defended her action, as a businesswoman who has never been too proud to look for help where she needs it, even if it smacks of opportunism. Meanwhile the fact that Trump has an army of staffers and family defending him is part of what inspired her to speak out, she said. “Nobody was defending me, that’s why I’m talking,” Harth said. “You can believe it or not, but I went through hell and I still have to relive this again. And I just, I’m horrified that I have to think about this again.” Michael Cohen, executive vice-president and special counsel to Donald Trump, responded by email to a Guardian request for comment, saying: “It is disheartening that one has to dignify a response to the below absurd query. Mr Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms Harth as these 24-year-old allegations lack any merit or veracity. “Hope [Mr Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks] will forward to you under separate e-mail, a series of e-mails documenting Ms Harth’s support of Mr Trump, the race for the White House as well as seeking a job opportunity with the campaign.” In an earlier phone call, Cohen said Harth had “massive credibility issues”.\\nSpeaking in Cleveland at the Republican national convention on Wednesday, Roger Stone, a veteran strategist and longtime Trump adviser, dismissed the allegations, saying: “I have an excellent bullshit detector.” Stone added: “A verbal agreement is entirely unprovable … So it’s more he said, she said. Sure sounds like bullshit to me.” Such responses from the Trump camp aren’t new and neither is the lawsuit, which Harth brought forward in 1997. She dropped it weeks later after Trump settled an outstanding business lawsuit from her partner Houraney claiming he broke contract by backing out of the American Dream festival. (Houraney sued for $5m but settled with Trump for a smaller, undisclosed amount.) Houraney met Harth when she was still in high school and though he didn’t witness any of the alleged incidents with Trump, aside from that first meeting in Trump Tower, Houraney has never doubted her. “I know they’re all true,” he said of the allegations. “I knew her way too long to think she could make up stuff like that, It wasn’t in her. She wasn’t capable of making up the things she said in that thing.” Harth told the Guardian she expected very little from Trump. “I’m not going to get an apology from him. That would be nice, but he – I don’t fully expect one. But he really should have been taught, if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say anything, OK? Don’t call me a liar. “He didn’t have to say anything. For once, he should have closed his mouth. He didn’t have to comment. We were on great – not great, I’ll take that back – we were on good terms, friendly terms. He didn’t – he started this. What is happening now is of his own making, OK? I was quiet.”', 'Here’s a roundup of the latest developments: Donald Trump shows no sign of backing down in the row over his decision to impose a travel ban on seven Muslim majority countries. In his latest tweets he mocked Democratic party opposition to the ban, and urged Congress to approve more of his cabinet nominations. On Monday night Trump fired Sally Yates, the acting attorney general after she advised justice department lawyers not to defend a travel ban she considered to be “not lawful”. In an extraordinary statement announcing her dismissal, the White House said Yates had “betrayed the department of justice”. Yates was immediately replaced by Dana Boente, whose first act was to undo her last act. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said news of Yates’ sacking was “chilling”. European Union President Donald Tusk has warned European leaders about Trump’s “worrying declarations”. In a letter to EU leaders Tusk included the new man in the White House as one of the threats to the geopolitical outlook. Lord Ricketts, the former Foreign Office permanent secretary, has called for a delay of up to three years on Trump’s planned state visit to the UK, to save the Queen embarrassment. He said: “If you did it two or three years into the Trump presidency the controversial early policy announcements would have been out of the way.” The UN’s refugee agency says 800 refugees will be denied entry to USA this week and 20,000 people will be left in precarious circumstances by the ban. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said he is “deeply worried by the uncertainty facing thousands of refugees” because of the ban. Thousands of people gathered across the UK to protest against Trump’s travel ban and his planned UK state visit. About 10,000 people were thought to have marched on Downing Street in London. 20 February was set as the date for MPs to debate a petition against Trump’s visit that has garnered 1.6m signatures. MPs unanimously passed a motion condemning the “discriminatory, divisive and counterproductive” travel ban. The emergency debate was called by former Labour leader Ed Miliband and Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who was born in Baghdad and risked being banned from the US. Former president Barack Obama has spoken out against Trump’s travel ban. Obama’s spokesman, Kevin Lewis, said: “Citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organise and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.”', 'It’s going to get worse for Donald Trump and his Republican party. Much worse. Normal candidates might have realized they were bumping along the bottom of their election – if not, their life – when video emerged of them bragging, as a newlywed, about forcing themselves on women, genitals and all. But not the man who promises to make America great again. No, Donald Trump’s so-called apology video was even more incompetent and incoherent than the rest of his campaign to date. And that’s quite an achievement for a man who has attacked a grieving, Gold Star family. Trump pretended he was a different man. A changed man. A man humbled by meeting real people on the campaign trail. “Anyone who knows me, knows these words don’t reflect who I am,” he said, before dismissing the whole thing as a distraction. But then he dropped the humility and apology shtick for not-so-subtle hint of how he intends to play this. “I’ve said some foolish things, but there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people,” he said. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.” If you think talk of sex is a distraction, you probably shouldn’t make it clear you’re going to continue the conversation at the next TV debate. And you probably shouldn’t attack a wife for her husband’s affairs if you want to win back a couple of women voters. Even if that wife is your opponent. Then again, this is a Republican nominee who urged the world via Twitter to check out the non-existent sex tape of a former Miss Universe who criticized him for demeaning her. This is a presidential candidate who has made an appearance in part of a soft porn video. This is a supposed leader who takes political advice from Roger Ailes, who was forced out of Fox News after numerous allegations of sexual harassment. This is Donald Trump: a man no longer fit for polite company. His name will be torn off walls just as Ailes’ was. Republican candidates up and down the land will be chased to election day with their previous endorsements and quotes praising the groper-in-chief. Condemning Trump’s words will not be enough to save them. It was just a few days ago that the US senator in New Hampshire, Kelly Ayotte, said “absolutely” when asked if she would tell kids to look up to Trump. She has since said she “misspoke”. But no amount of regret and criticism will erase that foolish misjudgment. Ayotte’s misjudgment is really shared by an entire party establishment that is now stampeding for the doors. Republican leaders thought they could cutely tiptoe between their Trump-loving base and Trump-disgusted moderates. Just as they have tried to appease the Tea Party, Obama-hating fringe for the last eight years. Now they find themselves consumed by their own compromises. You know it when you see it. That moment when an election turns decisively. Not a blip, not a gaffe, not a bad few days. But instead the point of no return for candidates and undecided voters alike. In 2008 you could sense it in the 24-hour period around the first debate: when John McCain suspended his campaign, then revived it, ahead of his big moment on stage with Barack Obama. Erratic was the rap against McCain, and erratic was how he behaved. Four years later, it came with the 47% video of Mitt Romney talking at a private fundraiser. Out-of-touch elitist was the caricature, and that’s how Romney sounded behind closed doors. Now we have the grotesque video of Donald Trump bragging: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” With it, Trump showed he is indeed the sum of all the sexist snippets we’ve heard so far. The basket of deplorables just found their Mr Universe. There is no point in pretending that Trump can claw his way back from here. He has now confirmed that he disdains women, and many women voters will surely return the favor. Until now, Trump’s defenders liked to justify his remarks about Rosie O’Donnell and Megyn Kelly by saying that the GOP nominee was just an entertainer. That’s not possible any more. Trump’s disgusting comments were made in private, not as a public performance. And that’s precisely why they are indelible. Trump was hardly in good shape with women voters before he slobbered over the prospect of assaulting them. They have represented the majority for almost 40 years of presidential elections, and this cycle will be no exception. Given his disastrous position with minorities, Trump’s sole hope was to win among white voters. But he was already losing to Clinton among white women: a voting group that Romney won. There simply aren’t enough white voters for Trump to win without sweeping the votes of white women. “I pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down,” Trump said in his half-baked apology video. Of all the unbelievable words that have come out of his pouting lips, these may be the least credible. Donald Trump will let his party down on Sunday, live on national television. The only remaining question in this election is whether his party can rescue anything of its own reputation even as he flushes his own down the sewer. On the campaign trail John McCain liked to quote the bleak joke from Charles Schulz, the cartoon creator of the perennial loser Charlie Brown: “It always looks darkest just before it gets totally black.” It’s time to say good night to the Republican party as we have known it for the last eight years.', 'Last summer, Donald Trump was giving a press conference at the reopening of his Turnberry golf resort in Ayrshire, when he noticed some small red things rolling towards him across the ninth tee. Lots of golfballs – all emblazoned with swastikas. “Sorry Mr Trump, I meant to put them out earlier,” shouted a functionary in a Trump Turnberry pullover, who then began handing out the balls to the assembled media. “Get him out of here,” said the then presumptive Republican presidential nominee. A perhaps understandable reaction given that, a few days earlier in Las Vegas, another Brit had tried to grab a police officer’s gun and shoot Trump. “Ten seconds later I was dragged off,” recalls Simon Brodkin, who had posed as a Trump employee. “Not sure who by. His bodyguards maybe. Then I was cuffed. After a while, I started to hear Scottish voices. I’ve never been so happy.” Why? “I thought: at least I’m not going to get tortured – or shot.”\\nIt’s quite tough being a prankster today, says Brodkin: “Terrorists have made my job very difficult. Everybody thinks you’re al-Qaida or a potential killer.” Well, not quite. As he sat cuffed in a cabin, Brodkin noticed a police sergeant eyeing him narrowly. “You’re that guy,” said the sergeant, to Brodkin’s delight. “In that moment,” he says, “I realised I had an ally.” The sergeant actually recognised not Brodkin, but his alter ego, the prankster Lee Nelson. “They loosened the cuffs so the blood went back to my fingers and asked if I wanted some Lucozade. Big love for the Scottish police.” Brodkin still gets a kick out of watching the press conference on YouTube. “You can see Trump is rattled. He went on to talk about being here in Florida!” Surely he could have pressed charges? “He could have, but instead his people said they would be satisfied if they threw me out of the country and the British secret services interrogated me – which I presume is a euphemism for waterboarding. And they weren’t going to do that. In the end, the police put me on the other side of the England-Scotland border. Presumably Trump’s people didn’t know I could just walk back across.” Why Nazi golfballs? “They were the cheapest,” jokes the Londoner. But, really, what parallels were you trying to draw? “Many people are fearful of him. His vitriol towards others and his self-aggrandising make a lot of people see connections.” Between Trump and Hitler? “Yes. What I’m doing is always about making comedy connections. I have a naughty streak, an utter lack of respect for authority – and hopefully a decent sense of humour.”\\nTrump is just one of the prankster’s victims. He has interrupted Kanye West at Glastonbury; tried to mingle with Man City players; thrown $600 in dollar bills at Fifa’s disgraced president Sepp Blatter; hoaxed Simon Cowell by masquerading as an orthodox Jewish rapper on Britain’s Got Talent; and renamed Philip Green’s superyacht the BHS Destroyer. Fittingly, a Channel 4 documentary featuring his greatest pranks will air next Tuesday for its fake news week. Have the people you prank got anything in common? “They’re all deserving targets,” he says – but he knows that, ultimately, his satire is unlikely to change anything. “I think maybe I’ll make a difference, then Philip Green carries on regardless. And Trump, since I pranked him, has gone on to be the leader of the free world.” Kanye fans were livid you disrupted his gig. “The thing was, he’d interrupted Taylor Swift at an awards ceremony, saying Beyoncé should have won, so I thought it was legitimate.” He was disappointed Kanye didn’t enter into the spirit. “If it had been Oasis, they would either have decked me or made me sing a duet.”\\nBut there is another kind of pranking, I say. A protestor called Dan Glass once glued himself to then-prime minister Gordon Brown to protest against Heathrow’s third runway. “Did he? Wow, big balls! I wouldn’t do that – I always think about my exit strategy. I make sure I’m not aggressive. I don’t want to be frightening.” But you have more guts than, well, me. “What I love is when reality and comedy clash,” he says. Like when Sacha Baron Cohen pranked Noam Chomsky as Ali G, asking the great linguist ‘How many words does you know?’ and ‘What is some of them?’ We giggle at the memory. At least Ali G didn’t get cuffed by Chomsky’s goons. Early in his career as a prankster, Brodkin got rough treatment – because officers didn’t know he was a comic and that it was all a prank. In 2013, going by the alter ego Jason Bent, he ran on to the pitch at Goodison Park, mingling with Man City players before being dragged off. He was charged with pitch encroachment. When the case came to court, he maintained his dim Scouse striker alter-ego, telling the court he had only run on because his agent had told him he’d been signed by Man City. I’m astounded he wasn’t done for contempt. He shrugs. Instead, the judge gave him a six-month conditional caution. “Then I went outside to the media scrum in character.” It was the same day Carlos Tevez, then a Man City player, was convicted for drink-driving. “So I said: ‘I’d like to thank Carlos for giving me a lift to court.’”\\nWho are the roughest police? “The Swiss.” He’s pranked twice in Switzerland, once throwing money at Blatter and telling the press the cash was to bankroll North Korea’s World Cup bid. And last March, Brodkin managed to get into the press launch for a new Volkswagen at the Geneva Motor Show. As VW’s Jürgen Stackmann was making a speech, Brodkin, posing as an engineer in overalls, tried to install a “cheat box”– referencing the VW emissions scandal, in which it was revealed that the manufacturer was cheating in pollution tests. “No one is going to find out about this one,” Brodkin told the audience as he tried to fit the box to the car, seconds before he was dragged off. “You know the job is a good one when you’re getting pinned down and cuffed,” he says. “The police were quite rough. To them, I was a terrorist. When I tried to get up, they shoved me back down. I said: ‘I’m allowed a phonecall.’ And they said: ‘No you’re not – we can hold you for 24 hours without any of that.’ I kept saying, ‘Just Google me. Trust me – I’m a clown!’” Eventually someone did. “After that,” says Brodkin, one cop picked up a hatstand pretending it was a mic and said, ‘And the award for best actor goes to … Simon Brodkin.’”\\nTen years ago, Brodkin was a junior doctor, doing something good for society. “I actually did put paddles on people’s chests, which was pretty cool. But I gave it up for comedy, partly because the NHS isn’t exactly a bed of roses.” Comedy became Brodkin’s vocation partly because of something he saw on a bus. “There was a guy with his mates, and they were flobbing on each other down the stairs, with complete disregard for anyone else. One of them was the prototype for Lee Nelson. He had such swagger!” Isn’t there a risk he is looking down on real-life Lee Nelsons? “Hope not. What I like about Lee is that he’s an equal-opportunity offender. He takes the mick out of everyone. There’s no hate in him. It’s all love.” Nelson has since taken on a life of his own. It was Nelson, not Brodkin, who stood briefly in the South Shields byelection in 2013, and Nelson who performed with street-dance duo Twist and Pulse on BBC1’s Let’s Dance for Comic Relief – winning the judges’ vote. In his current standup tour, he even expresses his opinions on Brexit. “I voted leave,” he says. “I was misled. I thought it was about Scotland.” What about future pranks? Brodkin declines to tell me who is in his crosshairs. But surely your pranking days are numbered now that you’re becoming so known? “I don’t think so. Once a prankster, always a prankster. Last year in Monaco, while trying to deface Philip Green’s superyacht, I thought: ‘This is my job.’ And I realised I couldn’t be happier.” • Britain’s Greatest Hoaxer is on Channel 4 at 10pm on 7 February. The Lee Nelson tour starts on 22 February. Details: leenelson.com', 'Theresa May defended the decision to invite Donald Trump on a state visit as thousands of protesters took to the streets across the UK and more than 1.5 million people signed a petition to try to stop the trip from going ahead. The prime minister made the briefest of responses to the domestic uproar over the US president’s attempt to ban travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries, insisting that the “UK takes a different approach”.\\nAddressing the issue during a joint press conference with the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, May stood by the red carpet invitation she had made during her meeting with Trump in the White House on Friday. “The United States is a close ally of the United Kingdom. We work together across many areas of mutual interest and we have that special relationship between us,” she said. “I have issued that invitation for a state visit for President Trump to the United Kingdom and that invitation stands.” However, she refused to go further and criticise her American counterpart despite mass condemnation of his decision to bar nationals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. At the same press conference, Kenny voiced disagreement with the executive order announced by Trump. The comments came as Downing street advisers did not deny claims that May had been informed about Trump’s plans to impose the travel ban when she met the president. Thousands took to the streets in cities across the UK, including Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow, Edinburgh and in London. Crowds gathered just metres from the gates of Downing Street, chanting: “Shame on May.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, wrote to the prime minister to urge her to listen to more than a million Britons who had called on her to cancel the state visit, in which Trump could address both houses of parliament. “This world defeated segregation, we defeated apartheid and we will defeat this nasty policy created to sow division and hatred,” he said. “His invite should be withdrawn until the executive orders are gone and every element of them repealed.” Some shadow cabinet members joined protestors, including Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary. Earlier, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, warned MPs not to demonise Trump or compare him to Adolf Hitler in a statement on the escalating row. Johnson told parliament that British passport holders with dual nationalities would now not be affected by the US travel ban after further conversations with senior figures within the White House. Following confusion caused by a US embassy notice telling UK dual nationals from the affected countries not to travel to the US, he said: “I’m able to provide the following clarification: the general principle is that all British passport holders remain welcome to travel to the US.\\n“We have received assurances that this executive order will make no difference to any British passport holder irrespective of their country of birth or if they hold another passport.” Johnson said he believed that the US decision to implement the so-called extreme vetting for nationals from the seven countries was “divisive, discriminatory and wrong”. But he argued that Trump was right to say that it did not amount to a ban on Muslims. Johnson repeatedly defended the new American leader and suggested his “bark is considerably worse than his bite”. He accused Labour of “pointlessly demonising” him. The foreign secretary said it was right that a close and important ally was welcomed to a state visit, pointing out that such an invitation was even extended to Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe and Romania’s Nicolae Ceaușescu. A number of Conservative backbenchers urged the British government not to interfere in American domestic policy, with Julian Lewis MP saying the Atlantic alliance was critical to security in the UK. MPs from all parties took to their feet to express alarm at Trump’s executive order, with many offering repeated references to the the politics of the 1930s. Dennis Skinner, the veteran Labour MP known for his combative outbursts on the floor of the Commons chamber, used the debate to brand Trump a fascist. “Will the foreign secretary just for a moment try to recall how I hid under the stairs as two fascist dictators – Hitler and Mussolini – rained bombs on towns and cities in Britain?” he asked. “Now this government is hand in hand with another fascist: Trump. Do the decent thing and ban the visit. This man is not fit to walk in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela.”\\nMike Gapes, a Labour MP, called the prime minister “Theresa the appeaser”, sparking an angry reaction from some MPs. Ben Howlett, a Conservative backbencher, quoted a speech by Winston Churchill about countries remaining neutral in the war, saying: “Each ones hopes that if he feeds the crocodile enough the crocodile will eat him last.” He said: “This dangerous trend towards nationalism which we have not seen since the 1930s inflicting itself on the western world has wrongly been defined as populism. It is clear this executive order needs to be condemned.” Johnson hit back at the comparisons, arguing that they were inappropriate. “I completely agree we must stand up against bigotry and nationalism. But I do draw the line at the comparison made relentlessly this afternoon between the elected government of our closest and most important ally, a great democracy, and the anti-democratic cruel and barbaric tyrannies of the 1930s,” he said. “Continually to use the language of appeasement demeans the horror of the 1930s and trivialises our conversation.” The warnings about rising nationalism came amid a string of other interventions from Conservatives angry about the US policy, including a plea from the Iraqi-born MP Nadhim Zawahi, who urged Trump to reconsider as a compassionate Christian. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, led Labour’s response, demanding more action from the government to protect UK residents from the seven countries affected by the ban, citing examples of people stranded and held at airports.\\nShe also pressed Johnson on Downing Street’s slow response to the order, with the government only promising to intervene on behalf of UK nationals 27 hours after it came into force. “In their discussions about terrorism and security, was this imminent order mentioned? I don’t know what’s worse, that the president would have such little respect for the prime minister that he wouldn’t think of telling her, or that he did and she didn’t think it sounded wrong,” she said. Yvette Cooper, who chairs parliament’s home affairs select committee, was shaking as she made an emotional intervention, saying: “One of our closest allies has chosen to ban refugees and target Muslims and all [Johnson] can say is that it wouldn’t be our policy. That is not good enough.” She responded to reports that May was told about the travel ban during her meeting with Trump, asking why she did not condemn the policy during a later press conference in Turkey. Johnson argued that May’s trip to the US was a success, stressing the importance of the relationship between the two countries, and saying that the government was not afraid of criticising its friend. After many had called on the government to take a firmer line, the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, gave the green light to an emergency, three-hour debate on Trump’s executive order. That debate culminated in the Commons unanimously passing an emergency motion from former Labour leader Ed Miliband that condemned “Trump’s discriminatory, divisive & counterproductive ban”. A former head of the Foreign Office has said that May’s invitation to Trump had put the Queen in a “very difficult position”. Lord Ricketts, who was permanent secretary at the Foreign Office from 2006-10 before becoming David Cameron’s national security adviser, said in a letter to the Times that the offer was “premature” and it was unprecedented for a US president to be given a state visit in their first year in the White House.', 'Ten days ago, Adil Kheder Nimr and his wife, Shatha Sulaiman Kheder, arrived in a place they call paradise. As the plane came into land in Seattle over the glistening waters of the Puget Sound, after a long journey from Iraq, he only had one thought: “Now we’ll be safe. My son will have a future. The US is my country now.” On his lap he held that son, a happy child with a tousle of black hair who had been born in a refugee camp 10 months previously. They named him Steven. Years earlier, Nimr had decided that if he ever had a son he would call him that. “I like American names and I always wanted to live in the US.”\\nOn their necks, Nimr and his wife wore necklaces with little metal crosses. They are not Christians, they are Yazidis, an ethnically Kurdish people who follow a monotheistic religion all its own. But they carried the symbol of the Christian faith as a sign of respect for their adoptive country. They showed reverence, too, for the new leader of their new home, who just a day after their plane hit the Seattle asphalt would become president of the United States. “Donald Trump is my president,” Nimr said, raising his hand to his head in salute. “I respect him. He is a strong man of North America.” Nimr wasn’t to know just how apposite that choice of words was. They arrived in Seattle on 19 January. Trump’s inauguration took place the following day and exactly a week after that, the strong man of North America signed an executive order that would ban all incoming refugees from Iraq from entering the US for at least 120 days. Among those left stranded on the wrong side of the ban were 13 other members of Nimr’s family, including his parents, sisters and brother. Though they have all been granted security clearance, and had dates scheduled to fly to Seattle, they are now in limbo. Trump has rationalized his immigration ban on the grounds of fighting Isis. Which sounds strange to Nimr, because he and his family were themselves victims of the terrorist group. In the eyes of the jihadist fighters of Islamic State, Yazidis are the lowest of the low. “They don’t see us as human, they say we are infidel,” he said, running his fingers across his neck like a sword. “Isis think it’s a prize if they catch a Yazidi. They will show us no mercy, they will do anything to us.” In addition to their ethnicity and religion, there was another problem. Nimr’s father worked as a translator for the US army in Iraq. As Isis grew in strength in the region, many interpreters, denounced as collaborators, were targeted for car bombings and assassinations.\\nNimr’s father began to receive regular death threats and on one occasion narrowly escaped kidnapping. Notes would be passed to him saying: “You are a spy for the United States, you work for the infidels.” In August 2014, the issue came to a head. Their town of Shekhan came under Isis attack and the 27-year-old couple were forced to flee north leaving their jobs – hers as a hairdresser, his in an internet shop – their home and their extended family. “It was about three in the morning,” Nimr said. “We awoke to the sound of bullets. No one knew what was happening. We just ran. A lot of families left loved ones behind – babies, elders – they had to save their own lives.” One of Nimr’s uncles, who was physically unable to get away, has not been heard of since. Nimr and his family found safe haven in a refugee camp in Kurdistan. From there they were offered a lifeline by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), one of America’s largest refugee resettlement groups, which has helped 20,000 people make new lives for themselves in Seattle over the past 40 years. While Trump has presented an image of refugees as being potential conduits of terrorism into the US, the profile of the typical person helped by IRC tells a very different story. Of the 771 who were resettled by the organization in Seattle last year, 70% were women and children, and 200 have gone on to become US citizens. IRC had anticipated before Trump’s ban came down that nationally about a quarter of the people it would be relocating to the US from Iraq and Afghanistan this year would be former translators for US forces who, like Nimr’s father, had faced death threats from the terrorists. Nimr talked to the Guardian through an interpreter in a mixture of Kurdish and Arabic, sitting in an apartment provided to the family by IRC in the suburbs of Seattle. The space is virtually bare, as they are in the process of moving again. Trump’s immigration ban means there is little chance that Nimr will be joined by the rest of his family any time soon. So they are being relocated by IRC to a smaller apartment. Despite the transience of the accommodation, the family remains overjoyed to be here. “I’m so happy I’m in the United States,” Nimr said. “I can go outside now, walk in the street, go shopping. I feel so safe and confident here. Back in Iraq I was too scared to go outside – you never knew what was going to happen.” But he is agitated. When asked simple questions, such as what he thinks about American television, he is unable to answer, turning his responses always back to the refugee camp in northern Iraq where his parents continue to struggle. “There’s not enough food there, no heating or electricity, or clean water to drink. They don’t care for the people in the camp. I’m so worried about my family there.” Trump’s executive order has left Nimr deeply confused. On the one hand he is overwhelmingly grateful towards his new country and its new president, and why not? They share a visceral hatred of Isis, which destroyed his life. “I am so happy Donald Trump is my president,” he said, saluting again. “He can protect the United States from terrorism.” But what’s happening now doesn’t make any sense to him. “Iraqi people are victims of terrorism, too. We didn’t fight the US. There are good people over there like my father who worked hard for the US army. They must be separated from the bad people or else they will die.” Asked what he would do were he to have a face-to-face audience with Trump in the White House, Nimr said: “I would kneel before him, and kiss his hand,” he said. “He is my president. But then I would ask him, very politely: please sir, would you think again?”', 'President Donald Trump has nominated circuit court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacant seat on the US supreme court, setting up a showdown with congressional Democrats and activists over a pick that could shape the ideological bent of the court for a generation. Gorsuch, 49, the youngest supreme court nominee in 25 years, was among a group of federal judges reported in recent weeks to be on Trump’s shortlist. A strict adherent of judicial restraint known for sharply written opinions and bedrock conservative views, Gorsuch, a Colorado native, is popular among his peers and is seen as having strong backing among Republicans generally.\\nThe nomination landed at a moment of sharply increasing alarm among progressives that the Trump administration plans to pursue extremist policies on core questions likely to come before the court, from religious equality to abortion rights, voting rights, access to healthcare, LGBT rights, anti-discrimination protections and more. Announcing his pick in the White House’s East Room, Trump described reading Gorsuch’s writings “closely”, as Gorsuch stood next to Trump listening with a fixed expression of earnest concern, holding his wife, Louise, with one arm. “I can only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once for the good of the country,” Trump said. Some prominent Senate Democrats immediately denounced Gorsuch as “unacceptable” and “extreme”. But it was unclear if there would be sufficient support to mount a filibuster and force a historic showdown over the nomination and Senate procedure.\\n“Make no mistake, Senate Democrats will not simply allow but require an exhaustive, robust, and comprehensive debate on Judge Gorsuch’s fitness to be a supreme court justice,” said the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a statement. If Democrats refuse to support Gorsuch, Republicans could decide to change the Senate rules to confirm him. But many Republicans are wary of this move, and are hopeful vulnerable Democrats will come around. Republicans were effusive in their praise of Gorsuch, calling him “highly qualified”, “universally respected” and, above all, “mainstream”. “There’s nothing not to like about Neil Gorsuch,” said Jeff Flake of Arizona. Even more enthusiastic praise came from Ben Sasse of Nebraska who told the Guardian that Gorsuch “is the kind of person that the founders envisioned sitting on the supreme court”.\\nMany Democrats are particularly bitter about the confirmation process after Republicans’ refusal last year to consider the nomination of circuit court judge Merrick Garland, Obama’s selection to replace Scalia. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, argued at the time that it would be inappropriate for a departing president – 11 months remained in Obama’s term – to make such a significant and long-term appointment. “This is a stolen seat being filled by an illegitimate and extreme nominee, and I will do everything in my power to stand up against this assault on the court,” said Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon who has said he is committed to blocking the nominee. The Democratic National Committee said Gorsuch’s nomination “raises some very serious questions” about whether he would be an independent and impartial justice, and noted that Trump’s litmus test for a nominee was a person who is “pro-life” and would overturn Roe v Wade. Trump’s nominee has the potential to tip the court one way or the other on important questions. If confirmed, Gorsuch would return the court to nine justices, filling a seat left vacant since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Working for the last year with an even number of justices, the court issued split 4-4 decisions on high-stakes questions such as the protection of undocumented immigrants and the health of public unions, leaving lower court rulings in place. The next justice to be confirmed may break such ties, giving new strength to the court’s conservative bloc, which could be further buttressed by future Trump nominations in the case of the retirement or death of a justice. One of the four liberal-leaning justices on the court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, turns 84 in March. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a centrist on the court who has sometimes split tie votes for the progressive wing, is 80 years old.\\nGorsuch’s track record as a judge on the US court of appeals for the 10th circuit does not shed obvious light on how he might rule as a supreme court justice on hot-button topics such as abortion and LGBT rights. He is the author of a book about euthanasia in which he writes, “to act intentionally against life is to suggest that its value rests only on its transient instrumental usefulness for other ends.” Ideological strands running through Gorsuch’s appeals court rulings would seem likely to endear him to congressional Republicans and Trump’s conservative base. He has shown himself to be solicitous to claims of religious exemptions from the law, to gun rights claims and to the prosecution of death penalty cases. Gorsuch did get praise from some Democrats. Neal Katyal, a former solicitor general in the Obama administration wrote in an editorial for the New York Times entitled “Why Liberals should back Neil Gorsuch” that Trump’s nominee was an “extraordinary judge and man”. During Trump’s announcement, Gorsuch addressed the crowd briefly, declaring himself “honored and humbled” and promising to be a “faithful servant to the constitution and laws of this great country” and paying tribute to the principles of impartiality, independence, collegiality and courage.\\n“A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge,” Gorsuch said, “stretching” for rulings he desires instead of reading the law on the page. Before he left the lectern, Trump sought confirmation that his primetime announcement had gone over as planned. “So was that a surprise?” he said. “Was it?” Gorsuch is a former clerk for Justice Kennedy, and some conservative analysts theorize that he could assert a rightward influence on the centrist Ronald Reagan nominee. Chuck Schumer had said he would filibuster Trump’s pick if he was outside the “mainstream”. On Tuesday night, he said he had “serious doubts” that Gorsuch would prove himself to be within the “legal” mainstream. Others used similar language, with the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, saying on CNN that Gorsuch is a “very hostile appointment” and “outside the mainstream”. Dick Durbin, the number two ranking Democrat in the senate, issued a statement suggesting Gorsuch deserved better treatment that Garland. “I will meet with Judge Gorsuch and support a hearing and a vote for him – both of which were denied to an eminently qualified nominee presented by President Obama,” Durbin said - although it was not clear from the statement whether he meant that he backed a floor vote in the senate or was still leaving the way open for a Democratic blockade after a vote in committee. Under current Senate rules, which require 60 votes for a supreme court confirmation, Gorsuch would need to win the support of multiple Democrats, who count 48 Senate caucus members to the Republicans’ 52. If the Democrats follow through with a filibuster, however, those rules could change. The previous Democratic leadership of the Senate changed the rules to require fewer votes for the confirmation of most executive nominees, and the current Republican leadership could make an additional change to the rules. McConnell earlier had vowed to confirm Trump’s nominee.\\nThe White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, downplayed the looming threat of an all-consuming political brawl over Trump’s nominee, telling reporters on Tuesday that he believed the Senate would reach the 60-vote threshold required to confirm supreme court appointees. Republicans dismissed any lingering hard feelings from the Senate’s refusal to hold hearings on Garland. “I think that’s a bogus argument” said Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “I thought it was a bit unfair when you look through the history of the country when a vacancy occurs in the last year of a sitting president and the primary process is almost over … if that’s the reason they use, it’s a bogus reason. Interest groups across the political spectrum will spend millions on a public campaign to legitimize or tear down a supreme court nominee. Already, conservative groups are running ads to pressure Senate Democrats in red states into siding with Republicans over the nominee. A fly-fishing enthusiast and skier who lives outside Boulder, Colorado, Gorsuch lived in Washington DC as a boy, after his mother Anne Gorsuch Burford was appointed by Reagan to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. After graduating from Columbia University, Gorsuch, who is said to have “an inexhaustible store of Winston Churchill quotes”, went on to Harvard law school and attended Oxford University on a Marshall scholarship. He worked as a corporate lawyer in Washington for a decade before his appointment to the circuit court by George W Bush in 2006, a post to which the Senate confirmed him by voice vote. The supreme court is currently in recess and is scheduled to reconvene for conference on 17 February.', 'President Donald Trump has announced Judge Neil Gorsuch – a staunch conservative – as his nominee for the vacant ninth seat on the supreme court bench. Calling Gorsuch “a man who our country really needs, and needs badly, to ensure the rule of law” in the spirit of the late Antonin Scalia, whose seat he would take if confirmed, Trump said his pick would enjoy “tremendous bipartisan support”. An “honored and humbled” Gorsuch said judges should strive for “impartiality and independence, collegiality and courage”, adding: A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.\\nRepublicans rushed to praise the nomination, with Speaker Paul Ryan calling it a “phenomenal” choice, and vice-president Mike Pence labelling Gorsuch: one of the most mainstream, respected, and exceptionally qualified supreme court nominees in American history. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said Trump had made an “outstanding decision”, warning: I hope members of the Senate will … show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an up-or-down vote on his nomination. But in a sign that the Senate could be heading for a filibuster, some Democrats – many of whom were keen to jog memories of the Republican block on Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland – said they would not support Gorsuch. Senator Elizabeth Warren said the judge’s rulings against workers and “hostility” towards women’s access to healthcare meant she would not vote for him. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, called the nomination “a very bad decision”. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, said Gorsuch must reach the 60-vote “super-majority” – “a bar that was met by each of President Obama’s nominees” – in a Senate where Republicans hold 52 seats to the Democrats’ 48: The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream … Given his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch’s ability to meet this standard.

Trump has refused to step back from his controversial executive order, despite global outrage, chaos at US airports and a stand-off between his administration and its own legal system. His policy, which immediately banned all citizens from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the US, is thought to have directly affected the travel plans of thousands of people inside and outside the country, and was challenged in the US courts within hours of being enforced.\\nTrump did not acknowledge the decision by a federal judge on Saturday night to partially block the executive order and a senior White House official said: “All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited.” Despite ongoing protests and confusion on the policy details, one administration official told Reuters the orders constituted a “massive success story”.\\nAs global condemnation of the ban spread, British Conservative figures joined the Labour party in questioning May’s decision to proceed with a state visit that would see Trump courted by the UK government and royalty. The backlash against May’s failure to condemn the move gathered pace amid fears that British citizens holding dual nationality could be affected. The government said they had been assured by the US that those citizens would not be affected by the ban as long as they weren’t travelling from one of the seven countries involved. Boris Johnson was still expected to face questions about the ban in the House of Commons on Monday. The foreign secretary, who used Twitter to call the policy “divisive”, will be pressed on why Britain took longer than others to receive assurances from the US and why May did not condemn the policy in the same way as other European leaders. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said she “regretted” Trump’s measure and described it as an unjustified “general suspicion against people of a certain origin of religion”. François Hollande, the French president, said Trump had opted for a “dead end response” to an “unstable and uncertain world”.\\nAfter May declined three times on Saturday to condemn the executive order during a press conference in Turkey, Downing Street released a statement overnight saying the government “does not agree” with this approach. On Sunday and under pressure, Downing Street said that May had convened a conference call with Johnson and Rudd to instruct them to speak to their equivalents in the State Department and Department of Homeland Security. But MPs from the prime minister’s own party have gone further, opting for a markedly different tone in condemning the president, with some questioning her decision to cosy up to Trump in Washington with a joint press conference before the ban was announced this week. Writing in the Guardian, Sarah Wollaston said photographs of Trump grasping May’s hand as they walked through the White House “smacked of the unwelcome infantilising of a strong female leader”.\\nThe Totnes MP wrote: “A shameful curtain of prejudice and discrimination is drawing across the land of the free and, if we are truly in a special relationship, true friends should be frank in saying so.” Wollaston said that while the state visit would be likely to go ahead, how it was done would provide an important “symbol”. She said Westminster Hall ought to be reserved for leaders who had made a lasting and positive difference to the world. “That does not include Mr Trump. No doubt there will be those who wish to fawn over him but that must not be from the steps of our nation’s greatest hall.” Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, also said state visits were intended to “celebrate and entrench the friendships and shared values between their respective countries … A state visit from the current president of the United States could not possibly occur in the best traditions of the enterprise while a cruel and divisive policy which discriminates against citizens of the host nation is in place. I hope President Trump immediately reconsiders his Muslim ban.” The impact of the ban on Britons was brought home as one Conservative MP, Nadhim Zahawi, who was born in Baghdad, said he feared he and his wife could no longer visit their twin sons, who are studying in the US. Sir Mo Farah, who came to the UK as a child from Somalia, warned that what he called a policy “of ignorance and prejudice” could see him separated from his US-based family. On the question of British citizens, Johnson spoke to Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, according to a source. The foreign secretary – who took to Twitter to condemn Trump’s policy, saying it was wrong to stigmatise people on the base of nationality – faced pressure to make a statement to the Commons or face an urgent question from Labour and the SNP. A statement released after Johnson’s call with Kushner and Bannon said: “The only dual national [British citizens] who might have extra checks are those coming from one of the seven countries themselves – for example a UK-Libya dual national coming from Libya to the US. The US has reaffirmed its strong commitment to the expeditious processing of all travellers from the United Kingdom.”\\nIt was unclear what revisions of the ban had been passed from the White House to border officials to guarantee these assurances that Britons would not be affected. A Labour source said: “Whatever happens, we will be demanding to know why the Canadian government was able to provide assurance to its nationals on Saturday evening that they would be unaffected by the ban, at the same time that No 10 was only just getting round to looking into [its] implications.” Labour is also expected to ask whether May knew of Trump’s order during her talks with him on Friday. The US president signed it the same day, after she had left. Jeremy Corbyn told the Guardian that Trump “should not be welcomed to Britain while he abuses our shared values … Theresa May would be failing the British people if she does not postpone the state visit and condemn Trump’s actions in the clearest terms. That’s what Britain expects and deserves.” With Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, also calling for the state visit to be cancelled, a petition to downgrade Trump’s trip gained almost a million signatures by early Monday morning, meaning it will be considered for debate in parliament. Separately, a Facebook-organised call for people to protest outside Downing Street at the policy on Monday evening prompted more than 17,000 people to say they would attend. However Downing Street said there were no plans to amend or call off Trump’s state visit, expected in the summer. Asked if there were any second thoughts, a spokesman said only: “We extended the invitation and it was accepted.” Farron said: “Any visit by President Trump to Britain should be on hold until his disgraceful ban comes to an end. Otherwise Theresa May would be placing the Queen in an impossible position of welcoming a man who is banning British citizens purely on grounds of their faith.” Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, said May should contact Trump directly to seek an end to the ban. “You’re the prime minister,” he tweeted. “Get on the phone to the president and tell him the ban cannot stand. And do it today.”\\nHeidi Allen, the Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire, told BBC1’s Sunday Politics that she wished May had spoken out on the issue during her visit to see Trump this week. “Given that she had built clearly an excellent relationship with President Trump and convinced him that Nato was the right thing to support, I felt she had the strength of relationship that she could have been firmer at the time,” Allen said. The presidential order places a 90-day ban on travel to the US for those from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen, seemingly including those with dual nationality. Trump has also banned refugees from entering the country for 120 days and those seeking asylum from Syria have been banned indefinitely. Nicola Sturgeon said May should make her intentions plain, adding that she would raise the issue with the prime minister at a Brexit-focused meeting of leaders from the devolved nations in Cardiff on Monday. David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show that the ban was “divisive” and it was “a particular concern” that UK nationals such as Zahawi could be caught up in it. Asked why it had taken May so long to respond, he said: “The prime minister is not a shoot-from-the-hip type of politician. She wants to see the evidence. She wants to understand precisely what the implications are.” Speaking on the same programme, Zahawi, who came to the UK as a child, said he and his wife were worried they would not be able to travel to see their twin sons, who are studying at Princeton University, despite holding 10-year US visas. “For the first time in my life, last night, I felt discriminated against,” Zahawi said. “It’s demeaning. It’s sad.”', 'An image of Donald Trump with his arm raised in a salute has been included on the cover of a collection of Adolf Hitler’s speeches. Publisher Ishi Press International has illustrated the back cover of Hitler’s collected speeches My New Order: volume one and the front cover of volume two with photographs of the presidential candidate. It declares in the book’s blurb that: “There are clear similarities between the speeches of Trump and the speeches of Hitler”, citing everything from repetition to name calling and a lack of logical justification for views held.\\n“They never admit they have made a mistake nor do they ever take anything back,” Ishi Press writes on both volumes. “To any criticism, they respond by insults and name calling. They use a low form of language, with simple sentences even a person with the lowest level of education or no education at all can understand.” The jackets of both volumes read: “My New Order has attracted the attention of the press with the rise of Donald Trump as candidate for president of the United States, because his first wife Ivana Trump revealed that Donald Trump reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed.” The publisher is referring to a 1990 Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner. Brenner interviewed Trump, who said it was a gift from “my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of Mein Kampf, and he’s a Jew” and denied having read the book: “If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.’” Davis later told Brenner: “I did give him a book about Hitler, but it was My New Order, Hitler’s speeches, not Mein Kampf. I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I’m not Jewish.” Brenner points out in her Vanity Fair piece that “Trump is no reader or history buff”, adding that “perhaps his possession of Hitler’s speeches merely indicates an interest in Hitler’s genius at propaganda”.\\nSam Sloan, head of Ishi Press International’s US arm, told the Huffington Post that when My New Order was published in 1941, there was “nothing on the back cover … so I decided to use that empty space for an advertisement for the book”. The Huffington Post identifies the photograph used by Ishi as from the 10 December front page of the Philadelphia News, which used the headline “The New Furor” to refer to the presidential candidate’s “latest hair-raising idea … to keep out all Muslims” from the US.', 'Dick Cheney and I were never soulmates. He used to eye me with suspicion. Once, during a routine meeting in the White House, the then vice-president suddenly said to me, “This is confidential,” as though, but for this caveat, I was likely to immediately brief the press on his inner thoughts.\\nBut let us give credit where it is due. In an interview with a conservative radio show host in 2015, Cheney said: “This whole notion that somehow we can just say no more Muslims, just ban a whole religion, goes against everything we stand for and believe in. I mean, religious freedom has been a very important part of our history and where we came from.” Cheney is absolutely right to assert that Donald Trump’s then threat, now a reality, of a ban on visas for anyone from one of seven Muslim-majority countries was – and is – wrong. It’s amoral. Like many policies that are wrong on one count, it has the overwhelming practical objection to it that it will almost certainly be counter-productive. For the skilled propagandists of Islamic State, last Friday’s executive order will have been an answer to their prayers. These ruthless jihadis prey on the vulnerable, on those feeling marginalised from western society, to move them first to alienation, then to violent hatred of everything the west stands for. And Trump has given them a rich diet of hatred. Add to that the absurdity of Trump’s choice of countries, with Saudi Arabia, the country that spawned the 9/11 terrorists, and which has since shown a monumental ambiguity towards some Sunni jihadi groups, left off. Just five days ago, a Washington friend of mine, well plugged into the Republican party, was venting about the “nutters of the far right” who had now taken over the west wing of the White House. “Are you saying,” I asked, “that these people are worse even than the one or two around Dick Cheney?” “Oh yes,” came the reply. “These Trump people are completely different from anything previously experienced in Washington, ever.” For the past 75 years, and as far into the future as one can see, Britain’s relationship with the United States will remain the most important one of all. Despite, or perhaps because of, its importance, it has never been easy. “There is no clear hierarchy of authority … There is perpetual internecine warfare between prominent personalities,” complained John Maynard Keynes of his wartime negotiations in Washington to secure financial support for Britain. He went on: “No work seems to be done on paper … no one seems to read a document and no one ever answers a document in writing. Suddenly, some drastic clear-cut decision is reached, by what process one cannot understand.” I kept this quote on my desk when I was foreign secretary. But it has to be said that the administrations of Franklin D Roosevelt, with whom Keynes dealt, and that of George W Bush, were paradigms of good practice compared with the early days of President Trump. I would never have voted for Bush (nor he for me), but in international relations, that is never the point. You identify your interests, and the other side’s, and how to maximise both. There were important differences of policy – some of which were public. Bush had serious, experienced people working with him, including Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. Belying his public image, in private George W Bush himself was remarkably willing to listen and to engage in sensible argument. On Iran, for example, I and my French and German counterparts, Dominique de Villepin and Joschka Fischer, had to face early hostility from parts of the US administration to our “E3” negotiations over Iran’s nuclear holdings (Donald Rumsfeld said it was a “disaster”). But, later, persuaded by Rice, Bush brought the US into the negotiations.\\nContrast all this with the challenge faced by Theresa May, Boris Johnson and colleagues. Trump’s new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and his defence secretary, General James Mattis, are generally thought to be competent individuals. But so far they seem to have remarkably little influence on the true believers in the White House and their boss who, we are told, dislikes both oral and written briefings, and relies on Fox News for his information. May was, in my view, right to go to meet Trump at the first opportunity. But her refusal to condemn his seven-country ban was unimpressive, and she needs to exert much more pressure to persuade Trump to abandon this awful, self-defeating policy altogether. The invitation for the state visit to the\\xa0UK may well stand, despite the million-plus petition against it. But it would be wise if the arrangements took a long time to settle. After all, both George W Bush’s and Barack Obama’s state visits took place over two years after their elections. Critically, the prime minister now has to reassure the British Muslim population that we value them for who they are and for their faith. However crucial a post-Brexit trade deal is, some things – like common humanity, decency, and respect for those of other religions – are more important.', 'Donald Trump said this week that “torture works”, leading to a debate on its effectiveness. I’ve actually experienced the torture he speaks of. In February 2003, at Camp Echo in the US military prison facility at Guantánamo, I signed a confession stating I was a member of al-Qaida. I did it as a result of coercion and torture.\\nI’d spent the preceding year at US detention facilities in Kandahar and Bagram, Afghanistan, where I’d been forcibly taken by US forces after being abducted, at gunpoint, from my house in Islamabad, Pakistan, by the CIA and Pakistani intelligence. On arrival at Kandahar I was beaten to the ground and my clothes sliced off with knives. US soldiers sat on top of me and shackled my bare wrists and ankles so tightly the marks lasted for months. I was then dragged naked, in a bowing position, and photographed, forcibly shaved, punched, kicked, spat upon, and interrogated. After that I was put in a jumpsuit and placed in a cage with automatic rifles pointed at me day and night. The only thing worse than having to endure this treatment was watching, impotently, as it was repeated against other human beings. It was in this state that British MI5 agents first saw me, hooded, shackled and kneeling. The sight seemed to have troubled them, but did not stop them interrogating me over the next three years. Weeks later, I was sent to Bagram, where conditions were even more oppressive. As an English-speaker I was interrogated more than most by numerous agencies, including British ones. In May 2002, I was taken into isolation and the CIA threatened to send me to Egypt or Syria if I didn’t cooperate, as they had done to a man called Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi. They told me he talked within days of arriving in Cairo. The CIA had me “hog-tied”, with my ankles tied to my wrists from behind and a hood placed over my head, for days at a time. Sleep deprivation, stress positions, beatings and loud noise followed. Bizarrely, the only real respite was the harrowing interrogations. During some of them, I was shown photographs of my children seized from my house and asked where I thought they were now. At the same time, I heard the blood-curdling sounds of a woman screaming from the next room. The effect was devastating. The FBI, who also took part, said they wanted me to confess – to anything. I next saw their agents soon after arriving in Guantánamo. They’d prepared a document they wanted me to sign, warning me I could face a summary trial and execution if I didn’t. I signed in the hope that the abuse would stop – it certainly receded – and that, once in court, I could expose the reality of what had happened to me. I was eventually released in 2005 without charge or trial and have been campaigning against torture ever since. During his election campaign Trump said he’d “load up” Guantánamo with more prisoners and reintroduce waterboarding and “a whole lot more”. This week he’s considering the reopening of CIA black sites ordered shut by his predecessor. It’s hard to understand his view, considering the use of torture led to the Iraq war, which he now condemns.\\nUnder torture, the same Al-Libi the CIA told me about gave false testimony to US interrogators in Egypt that al-Qaida was working with Saddam Hussein on obtaining chemical weapons. Iraq had no al-Qaida presence. But after the invasion the cruelty meted out in US-run prisons such as Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca became the fuel for the fire of Islamic State; 17 of its top leaders had been tortured in these prisons. Torture did not save lives, it destroyed them and created monsters instead. British journalist and current Isis hostage John Cantlie was waterboarded by his captors, while executioner “Jihadi John” is reported to have waterboarded US national James Foley before decapitating him. Although President George W Bush blatantly used torture, he never admitted it. He simply got his legal advisers to reinterpret and rebrand it. “Enhanced interrogation techniques” did not amount to torture if they didn’t cause “organ failure or death”, it was claimed. That’s how Guantánamo prisoners such as Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed could be waterboarded hundreds of times without any repercussions for the CIA. We now know more than in 2002 about what torture does, its devastating effects and its unintended consequences. If the new leader of the “free world” still endorses this barbaric practice, it’s up to the rest of the free world to make sure he has no chance to carry it out.', 'It’s been a predictably hectic first week in office for the president of the US, which he has spent fretting over the size of the attendance at his inauguration while signing bits of paper with all the abandon of a small child with a long stick who has just stumbled across an unsupervised blank canvas of freshly laid cement. In the time it takes most civil servants settling into a job to obtain a security pass and computer log-in, Donald Trump has – among other highlights – signalled his intention to do away with Obamacare, given torture an effusive thumbs up, threatened the city of Chicago with martial law on the back of inaccurate crime statistics, inked an anti-abortion gag that will imperil the lives of women, ordered an investigation into nonexistent voter fraud and demanded the immediate construction of a 1,000-mile wall between America and Mexico. A lot done, more to do. Once these, and other equally trivial issues, have been dealt with there will inevitably come a time when what passes for Trump’s attention turns to the more serious business of sport. While it has been a struggle to avoid drowning in a tidal wave of polemics written by commentators incredulous at his apparently boundless capacity for self-delusion, dishonesty and impulsive buffoonery, this week’s back pages have at least remained something of a sanctuary, mercifully unsullied by talk of alternative facts until José Mourinho piped up to announce Manchester United’s impressive 18-match unbeaten run shows no sign of ending any time soon despite all available evidence to the contrary.\\nBut back to Trump, who despite emphatic recent denials of a previously unpublicised enthusiasm for water-sports was a keen athlete in his youth. The 1964 edition of the New York Military Academy yearbook lists the 45th president as having played six different sports at his alma mater, including soccer. It was perhaps through\\xa0his participation in so many different disciplines that he became\\xa0an\\xa0authority on what does and does not constitute harmless locker-room banter. “He was just the best, a good athlete, a great athlete,” Trump’s former room-mate Ted Levine said. “He could have probably played pro ball as a pitcher. I think he threw 80mph. I was the catcher. He made my hand black and blue every day. Could he play football? Could he play soccer? He could do anything he wanted. He was physically and mentally gifted.” Hmmm. As implausible as this testimony may sound, it should be noted Levine is not part of Trump’s administration, a state of affairs that suggests what he’s saying may well be true. Now 70, Trump finds himself confined to the country club locker room, where he numbers Jack Nicklaus and Bernhard Langer among his friends, even if the latter may beg to differ. No stranger to playing a round, he remains a keen golfer and boasts a handicap of three, although the rock star Alice Cooper has hinted Trump is the biggest cheat he’s ever played with. With 17 courses around the world to his name, the Donald has no shortage of facilities on which to practise the game’s dark arts. As the new president, many of Trump’s forays into the world of sport are likely to be little more than symbolic: welcoming victorious teams to the White House, bestriding the mound for the occasional ceremonial first pitch and waterboarding apologetic Mexicans who ring the White House doorbell to ask for their ball back. He is, however, likely to be called on to back his country’s bid for the 2026 World Cup and it is here his interest in football could serve him well. Unlikely rumours that Trump once considered buying Rangers, a football club whose tax affairs were once even more opaque than his own, have been debunked but he does have other previous in the field of administration. In 1992, he appeared on an episode of Saint and Greavsie to pair Leeds with Manchester United in a League Cup draw, while the disgraced former Fifa and Concacaf executive-turned-supergrass Chuck Blazer once rented a couple of well-appointed Trump Tower apartments with “sweeping views of Central Park and the crenellations of the Plaza Hotel”. Blazer famously roamed wild in one of the apartments while his cats did so in the other. Beneath them, Chuck’s former employers Concacaf occupied the entire 17th floor of the building. With it looking increasingly likely any United States bid for the 2026 World Cup may be looked on favourably by Fifa, Concacaf’s\\xa0president, Victor Montagliani, has stated Trump could play a key role in helping the US ingratiate itself with a football governing body that has similar self-regard and is as open and accountable as the president. By contrast, Sunil Gulati, the president of the US Soccer Federation, has been more circumspect, perhaps because of his organisation’s close ties to high-ranking Democrats including Bill Clinton. “He’s the president of the United States and we’ll work with him,” he said. Sadly for Gulati, with the US looking likely to co-host the tournament along with Trump’s football-loving Mexican chums, one suspects any requests for a White House endorsement will come up against a long, towering and prohibitively expensive brick wall.', 'Donald Trump tried to distract voters from a weeklong controversy over his insults toward a former Miss Universe on Friday night by asking Barack Obama to pledge not to “pardon Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and against society itself”.\\nOnly hours earlier, the Republican nominee had gone on a predawn Twitter rampage about Alicia Machado, tweeting false accusations that she had a sex tape and that Clinton had somehow helped Machado become an American citizen. He later tried to justify the tweets, writing: “For those few people knocking me for tweeting at 3 o’clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!” The Clinton campaign quickly responded. “His latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him,” the Democratic nominee told a rally in Florida. She also responded on Trump’s medium of choice, Twitter: “What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?”\\nThe former secretary of state spoke in Coral Springs, where she unveiled a plan to expand national service opportunities for young Americans. But Clinton also scorned Trump at length there, asking: “Who gets up at three o’clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe?” Late Friday, BuzzFeed found that Trump had had a cameo in an explicit Playboy video made in 2000, prompting a response from Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill. “There’s been a lot of talk about sex tapes today, and in a strange turn of events only one adult film has emerged today and its star is Donald Trump,” Merrill told reporters.\\nOn Friday evening, Trump attempted to change the subject by amplifying his attacks on Clinton, citing the Clinton Foundation’s international donors and her handling of emails as secretary of state. Republicans often criticize Clinton along these lines, but Trump has recently escalated the rhetoric. He called Clinton a “globalist” and a “vessel for special interests … who want to strip [the US] of its status as a sovereign nation” and accused her of “many crimes against our country and against society itself”. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to questions about what crimes the nominee meant. The Republican nominee also stirred concerns about voter fraud, returning to the unsubstantiated claims of a “rigged election” and “cheating” that he made for several weeks this summer. On Friday, Trump claimed voter fraud “is a big, big problem in this country” and that “nobody has the guts to talk about it”. He then urged attendees at this rally to “go and watch the polling places and make sure it is on the up and up”, even though an exhaustive investigation in 2014 found only 31 potential incidents of in-person voter fraud in all US elections over 14 years. The complaints about a “rigged” system follow days of negative revelations about the nominee. A report in Newsweek showed evidence that Trump’s company had violated the embargo on doing business in Cuba, and a report in the Washington Post showed Trump’s charitable foundation lacks a license to solicit money, though it has appeared to do so for years. Several conservative or apolitical newspapers also refused to endorse Trump this week. On Friday, the San Diego Union-Tribune, which has endorsed every Republican presidential candidate since 1868, announced that it would back Hillary Clinton. In doing so, its editorial board wrote: “Trump could be our Chávez, our Kirchner. We cannot take that risk.” It was joined by USA Today, which issued its first-ever presidential endorsement to write that Trump was “unfit for the presidency”. The national paper did not endorse Clinton but merely urged readers to vote for anyone but Trump. Other papers, including the Arizona Republic and the Cincinnati Enquirer, have broken their conservative record to back Clinton. A number of other traditionally conservative papers, such as the Chicago Tribune and the Detroit News, have endorsed Libertarian Gary Johnson instead of Trump. One newspaper has broken its apolitical history to endorse Trump. In March, he became the first candidate endorsed by the National Enquirer in the tabloid’s history.', 'Donald Trump and Theresa May bonded over their shared admiration for Margaret Thatcher as they lunched at the White House on Friday – and he hopes their relationship will become even closer than the famous political romance between the Iron Lady and Ronald Reagan. May’s historic US visit was the centrepiece of a whirlwind diplomatic tour that took in Philadelphia and Ankara, as well as Washington. But her key priority was to strike up a warm relationship with Trump, and on that score it was mission accomplished.\\nAfter pulling off a mercifully gaffe-free press conference, the pair disappeared behind closed doors to continue their conversation in private, over an all-American lunch of beef short ribs. May and Trump are an oddly matched pair – a flamboyant billionaire reality-TV star and a vicar’s daughter who has built a solid political career on staying out of the limelight. But Downing Street insisted the conversation was “warm, free-flowing and unscripted”. The two leaders chatted about “shared admiration” for Thatcher and her partnership with Reagan, No 10 said, and the fact that, “they achieved great things together, in their own countries and in the wider world”. Trump told the prime minister that he had looked up to Reagan, and wanted his relationship with May to be even stronger. He told her more than once that when he goes to the UK on a state visit later this year – after May extended an invitation from the Queen – “I want to see you first”. Team May was delighted with the outcome of Friday’s meeting in the Oval Office and the press conference beneath the chandeliers of the White House. There were plenty of reasons to remain cautious, however. Committed to leaving the European Union, May came in need of a lifeline but got few details on a trade deal. She and Trump were hardly in lockstep over sanctions on Russia. And although she had gone into the visit claiming “opposites attract,” the alleged personal chemistry was not visible to the eye. Both leaders tried hard, but the relationship looked brittle. To celebrate getting through an 18-minute press conference without a diplomatic catastrophe as a victory might seem the definition of setting the bar low. But it is also a measure of who Britain is now dealing with. The last time Trump shared a platform with a female politician for a question-and-answer session, he called her a criminal, a puppet and “such a nasty woman”. That was October’s presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. It was a warning to May, as if one were needed, that Friday’s visit would be no normal exercise in diplomacy. For a start, a White House schedule sent to journalists referred to the prime minister three times as “Teresa May”, leaving out the “h” in her first name. Teresa May, it transpires, is the name of a “veteran” UK glamour model and porn star. It was 12.16pm when, according to a pool report, journalists stepped into the Oval Office to see Trump and May standing near chairs next to the fireplace. Between them was the newly returned bust of Winston Churchill, whose coinage of the phrase “special relationship” has burdened prime ministers and presidents ever since. Wearing a dark suit, red tie and an American flag badge, the president moved a lamp so reporters could have a better view of the bust. “This is the original,” he said twice. “It’s a great honour to have Winston Churchill back.” May, dressed in a red suit that nodded to the Republican party, said: “It’s a great honour to be here.” Standing close by were Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who urged the media to “keep its mouth shut”, national security adviser Michael Flynn, who once tweeted that fear of Muslims is rational, senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, and press secretary Sean Spicer, who told tall tales about the size of his boss’s inauguration turnout. Being the first global leader to meet Trump was fraught with risk. But by binding him into a public affirmation of the two countries’ backing for Nato, and with a soft-voiced Trump at his most emollient during their press conference, May could claim to have brought him into the fold, rather than whitewashing his reputation. By publicly reiterating Britain’s view that sanctions on Russia must remain in place, amid reports that Trump is preparing to lift them, she also underlined the fact that she is willing to tell him uncomfortable truths. Some voters may think she should not have rushed to meet the controversial billionaire; but May’s advisers believe the public will see Friday’s trip as “pragmatic” and as proof that the pair can have a “grown-up” relationship. For all the briefing and preparation, May’s team knew that, such was Trump’s unpredictability, the best advice to the prime minister was to “wing it”. They only found out that a formal press conference would take place when Spicer tweeted about it. There was no winging it on the first leg of the trip in Philadelphia, however; the speech May gave to Republican leaders at their annual retreat was carefully crafted, and she used it to set out a distinctive stance in a way that would have been impossible to do in a half-hour press conference. As well as the usual warm words about the special relationship, she stressed the importance of facing down Russian aggression and shoring up Nato – and warned of the risks if Britain and the US “step back” from their global responsibilities. One key player in drafting the speech, honed on the plane en route to Philadelphia, was her strategic adviser Chris Wilkins, who, like May’s no-nonsense director of communications Katie Perrior, and joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, worked with her on the “nasty party” speech to the Conservative party conference more than a decade ago. Wilkins, described by colleagues as an unassuming Welshman, was also involved in the Lancaster House Europe speech this month – another key plank in what is becoming something like a philosophy of Mayism – but the prime minister herself works over paragraphs, and scratches out passages she doesn’t like.\\nThere is a streak of patriotic nostalgia running through May’s politics, which makes her less uncomfortable with Trump’s form of populist nationalism than David Cameron might have been. In her Philadelphia foreign policy speech, she made liberal use of Churchill quotes and name-checked the Magna Carta. In Washington, where she visited the Arlington cemetery, she made a point of visiting the grave of Churchill’s man in Washington, Sir John Dill. Later, she posed for snaps with Trump as he pointed proudly to the bust of the irascible leader, restored to pride of place in the Oval Office, after Barack Obama demoted it in favour of Martin Luther King Jr. It is hard to imagine any other recent prime minister deliberately drawing parallels between their own politics and that of Trump; but May and her colleagues believe they are riding the mood of the times. The dark side of Trump’s nationalism was on display almost immediately after May left, however, when he signed an executive order banning refugees from entering the US. The impression that Britain is willing to dance with the devil was only underlined by the fact that May flew straight from Washington to meet the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at his opulent palace in Ankara. May believes her whistlestop diplomacy showed that Britain will remain at the centre of global affairs even after Brexit; but it may also cement the idea in the public’s mind that, as it turns away from the EU, the UK will have to seek friends wherever it finds them. As for the already famous moment when she and Trump briefly held hands, which was captured by photographers and splashed over front pages worldwide, Downing Street said that rather than an indication of intimacy it was simply a chivalrous gesture, as Trump reached out to support the prime minister down an “unseen ramp”. Nevertheless, May was pleased with the coverage. “We all thought that today’s front pages were very positive,” Downing Street said. Trump himself was so delighted he told her he would save the menu card from their lunch as a souvenir, telling aides: “Keep that safe: I had lunch with the British prime minister!”', '“Because Donald Trump thinks it’s a good idea” has got to be among the most unconvincing reasons for Australia to do something. But that’s pretty much where Scott Morrison is going with his second attempt to get the Coalition’s “jobs and growth” election plan and its $48bn worth of company tax cuts through the parliament. Facing the prospect of only winning Senate support for the small business end of the tax breaks, the government decided to shelve the lot and try again this year. Business leaders have been keen to hold it to that plan, loudly insisting the tax cuts need to proceed in newspaper editorials through the summer and even while enjoying an annual summer yacht race.\\nAnd on a trip to London the treasurer has duly started his new and improved sales pitch with a dire warning. If parliament doesn’t pass the tax cuts we’ll be “stranded” because the UK is reducing its tax rate to 17% by 2020 and Trump wants to reduce the US rate to 15%. Leaving Australia’s rate at 30% would “run the great risk of stranding our businesses and the jobs that rely on them”, he said. Surely we need a bit more evidence than a simplistic comparison of raw tax rates before we join the rush to reduce our national tax revenue even further. Arguments for a competitive tax rate have to be assessed in context and we went through most of them during that long and repetitive election campaign, memories of which are, mercifully, fading. Treasury modelling did show the planned tax cuts would boost economic growth, a little bit. But there was no way to compare that increase (0.6% of gross national income in a decade’s time) with other things that might have been done with the money. And there were no answers to questions about how we would manage the revenue shortfall, at a time when Australia is struggling to pay for things like hospitals and schools and when inequality is already rising, nor any analysis of the social and economic consequences of even more cuts to services. There was the complicating factor of Australia’s unique dividend imputation system, which meant the real tax rate for local investors is lower than the headline rate.\\nAnd there were also the inconvenient revelations about how many big companies use complicated profit-shifting schemes to pay little or no net tax, which somewhat undermined the argument that they were all about to rush offshore because they pay too much tax here. To its credit the government responded to those revelations with a diverted profits tax – a so-called “Google tax” – to try to fix that problem: a 40% penalty for companies caught undercutting Australia’s tax rate of 30% by transferring profits to countries with a lower tax rate without a good enough reason. It’s supposed to start in July but it hasn’t yet been legislated. And the same big businesses, and the global law firms that advise them on how to manage their taxes, have also started the new year arguing that the “Google tax” crackdown needs to be weakened because, you guessed it – we’ll be uncompetitive with the new tax regime Trump is planning. Despite all their lobbying, a country’s tax rate isn’t the only factor that determines where companies invest – they also take into account things like political and economic stability.\\nAnd given the ructions of Brexit in Britain or the political convulsions in the US or the other tax ideas the new president is spraying around, like punitive import tariffs, we would have to rank pretty well on those measures. Perhaps that relative political stability also has something to do with our comparatively strong social safety net, which the company tax take helps to pay for. We sure wouldn’t need to raise as much company tax if we followed Trump’s Obamacare lead and abolished Medicare, or ditched the national disability insurance scheme or moved to a US-style system for helping the unemployed. By all means debate whether Australia’s tax rate is competitive but if we’re going to benchmark ourselves against the company tax rate Trump is planning, we should also talk about what emulating him would mean for our society.', 'Donald Trump’s executive order to close America’s borders to refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries has been swiftly enforced. The order blocks to the US from citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya for 90 days and as well as indefinitely suspending admission of Syrian refugees. The 45th president of the US also had a big day as he took phone calls from major world leaders including the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile Theresa May has met with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and a joint press conference was held. Here’s a roundup of the key events of the day: Criticism of his “muslim ban” came in from all quarters including Madeline Albright, the former US secretary of state, Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani campaigner for girls’ education and Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. We received the first reports of arrivals blocked at US airports. The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) described the executive order as worse than a draft form that had been leaked earlier in the week. Twelve nobel laureates are among thousands of signatories to a petition calling on Trump to renounce the order. A legal challenge has been filed against Donald Trump’s executive order by lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees. Theresa May and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have signed a £100m commitment to build new fighter jets. May refused to condemn Trump’s refugee ban when pressed on the issue by journalists at a joint press conference. People holding so-called green cards, making them legal permanent US residents, are included in the executive action. Iran vowed to take reciprocal action. Trump spoke to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. We spoke to travellers who had been turned away from flights and those who don’t know when they will see their families again Thank you so much for staying with us throughout the day and contributing your stories via our callout. We’re closing the live blog now, but will of course be publishing further stories on today’s events.', 'Donald Trump has predicted the breakup of the European Union and warned Scotland against the risks of a second independence referendum. During a visit to Scotland hours after Britain opted to leave the EU in a historic referendum, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said that without strict migration controls Europe would be unrecognisable within a decade.\\nIn an interview with the Times, Trump said: “The people have spoken. I think the EU is going to break up. I think the EU might break up before anybody thinks in terms of Scotland. I really think that without the immigration issue [the EU] wouldn’t have had a chance of breaking up ... the people are fed up, whether it’s here or in other countries. You watch: other countries will follow.” Trump’s own campaign in the US has centred on his controversial stance on immigration, including the erection of a wall on the US-Mexican border and the imposition of a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the US. Asked what he would do to curb the number of migrants entering southern Europe, he said: “I would not allow them in. I would help them but I would have to bring them back and maybe create safe zones over there in some form.\\n“You’re going to have to. You cannot allow this to happen to Europe. It would be so much easier for me to tell you: ‘Oh, I’d accept them with open arms,’ but Europe is not going to be recognisable in 10 years.” Trump said Barack Obama’s intervention in the EU referendum campaign, when the president warned that Britain would be back of the queue for a trade deal with the US, was “negative”, and promised to prioritise the country in a future deal. While he gave assurances that the special relationship with the US would continue with England, Scotland and Northern Ireland independently, he urged caution against breaking up the UK. “One thing I have to say about Scotland is they have to be careful. The oil price is down and those [Scottish revenue] numbers are a lot different when the oil prices are down.” He added that the thought of going through another disruptive independence referendum so soon “is very sad”. Trump broke off from the White House campaign trail for the visit to his golf resorts in Scotland at the weekend. On Saturday, the Guardian was denied access to an event after Trump took offence over a reporter’s question regarding his allegedly “toxic” politics.', 'The invitation to meet a newly inaugurated US president is a sign of prestige and an opportunity, regardless of who holds that office. For Theresa May to be the first foreign leader to enjoy the privilege is undoubtedly a\\xa0feather in Britain’s diplomatic cap. Whatever misgivings the world might have about Donald Trump, access to the White House is a source of power and influence, better to have than to forfeit. But it would be naive for Mrs May to imagine that her trip to the US on Friday can be treated as traditional statecraft. She cannot ignore global anxieties about Mr Trump’s volatile character and policy agenda. The president’s first week in office has contained no sign that he intends a pivot towards moderation or is capable of one. What you see with Mr Trump is what you get – a man without affection for the rules of diplomacy or respect for the protocols of his office, the US constitution, objectively verifiable truth or international law; a man both vain and insecure who looks out on the world as if through a lens, seeking opportunities to wield power over others; a monumental narcissist. Mr Trump’s contempt for the norms of international relations does not mean Mrs May should disregard them too. She is right to underline Britain’s longstanding strategic partnership with the US. Presidents come and\\xa0go and global alliances are built on more than transient personality politics. It is too early to say that Mr Trump’s apparently tyrannical character heralds some deeper subversion of American democracy, which has strong foundations. It is not impossible that Mrs May will have some positive influence, steering the president towards a more balanced approach to questions of European security, for example. She must try. Mr Trump’s opinions of Nato and the EU show contempt for institutions that have underpinned global security and prosperity. His cavalier attitude towards the use of torture and his readiness to make immigrants the scapegoat for all of modern America’s ills are not merely illiberal – they testify to disregard for values that should be\\xa0the underpinning of any meaningful alliance between democracies. In strategic terms, Mr Trump’s readiness to see the EU unravel is especially dangerous for Mrs May. She is about to embark on difficult negotiations with European leaders who will be appalled by Mr Trump’s apparent hostility to their project. He celebrates Brexit as a twin movement to the one that saw him elected and eagerly anticipates more disruption in the same vein. For a British prime minister to be seen in collusion with that destructive fantasy would make separation talks much less amicable. But Mrs May is travelling to Washington with the intention of signalling Britain’s economic independence from the rest of Europe. She hopes to make progress towards a bilateral free trade deal and thereby persuade her domestic audience as well as continental leaders that the UK has offers to rival the privileges it would surrender on exit from the European single market. The problem with this objective is its transparent desperation. Mr Trump may be ignorant but he is no fool. Aggressive, zero-sum deal-making is the one area where he can plausibly boast expertise. He can see that Mrs May’s need for an agreement is politically urgent. The commercial opportunities offered by the UK to the US, while potentially attractive, are not indispensable. Trump also embraces a trade doctrine that treats imports as a sign of weakness. He is not interested in opening US markets to foreign producers. His inaugural speech was a manifesto of protectionism and economic nationalism. No amount of cultural affection for the UK or personal camaraderie that might be struck up with the prime minister will overcome the new White House administration’s determination that trade is conducted to satisfy an “America first” doctrine. Mrs May’s hand is weak in Washington and the worse she plays it, the weaker she becomes in Europe too. She might hope that effusive tribute and appeals to historical partnership will earn Mr Trump’s admiration and amplify Britain’s status in the world. But it is far from clear that Mr Trump is a reliable or stable partner and uncertain that his friendship will, in the longer term, be much of a recommendation to the rest of the world.\\xa0It is right that the prime minister wants to sustain the old trans-Atlantic partnership. But\\xa0that can be achieved without abandoning loyalty to European neighbours and it must be done without betraying values that have sustained other alliances.', 'Theresa May’s early visit to Donald Trump probably seemed like a good idea at the time. Pushing to the front of the White House queue is what British prime ministers do when there’s a new US president. Trump knows and likes Britain too, to the extent that he cares about any foreign country. The two countries are also allies. And new leaders need to have face time. But the race was always a demeaning ritual, and now it is more demeaning than ever. Transatlantic relations are important, of course. But what would it matter if the British prime minister met the US president in February, rather than in January? Nothing would be lost. No other country except perhaps Israel cares so neurotically about Washington’s welcome mat.\\nAnd anyway, this is President Trump we are talking about. It’s not Abraham Lincoln or Franklin Roosevelt. Trump is upending not just US politics but global politics too. He overturns a civilised norm every day before breakfast. He is despised in Britain, and nothing May says is going to change that. The Washington visit is thus more fraught with dangers than opportunities for the prime minister. Even her senior supporters say they are struggling to think of the positives. They, and probably she, will likely be content if she gets back without anything too disastrous having happened. There is an immediate danger with the visit and an underlying one. Both are large. The immediate one is Trump himself. What he is doing on issues such as torture, wall-building, China or entry bans is reckless enough. But what he might say with May by his side is the stuff of spin doctors’ nightmares. She doesn’t do personal chemistry, and he is loathsome. May is not stupid. Nor are those advising her. To put it mildly, they know there are pros and cons. Before the election they could be scathing about Trump and his people. But they have decided, rationally enough, that they still need a serious relationship, even with Trump. They are right. It has to be done, if only to coordinate intelligence and to help pull Trump back from policies that could abandon eastern Europe to Vladimir Putin. But not at absolutely any price. May will lose credibility at home if she does not put clear distance between herself and some of the things Trump has been saying. Above all, rejection of torture should be a red line, both on principle and in practice – but also because, as Tony Blair found, a reputation can unravel if one equivocates. May must beware the perils of poodledom. May needs to make time in Washington to denounce torture. This feels even more raw to me this week because of Wednesday’s untimely death of Nigel Rodley – the longtime legal chief of Amnesty International, a former UN rapporteur on torture and a lovely and principled man. His memory demands a clear and immediate statement against torture from our prime minister.\\nBut the deeper and underlying danger is this. The US-UK special relationship remains far more important to the British governing class than it does to the Americans. It too often skews British thinking. That was true even in the cold war, and in the aftermath of 9/11. Even Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair struggled to make it convincing. But with an “America first” president, it risks seeming more delusional than ever. All this is spiced up by Brexit, as is everything in British politics now. Brexit means London’s wish to be embraced in Washington has been heightened, because our back is turned on Europe, because we are a trading nation, and because the world remains a dangerous place. A trade deal with the US is top of the leavers’ wish list, but this too is a potentially treacherous prospect. It owes more to the wishful thinking of UK Atlanticists than to hard economic reason, which still points firmly to Europe. Brexit’s impact has hustled May into this visit in other ways. Don’t underestimate the Farage factor. The former Ukip leader’s closeness to Trump may be a bid of a fraud on both sides, but it has freaked out both No 10 and the Foreign Office. Boris Johnson’s recent trip, and now May’s, have been accelerated by the need to push Nigel Farage firmly to the margins. May’s priority of priorities is to squeeze the air out of the Ukip threat. Trying to understand Trump better is important. May needs to do it. We all need to do it. Indignation and outrage are necessary, but not enough. But there is no need, either in principle or in practical statecraft, for kowtowing before Trump’s chariot.\\nAs she heads for Washington, May is on the threshold of making her own version of Blair’s error. In 2001 at Camp David, it was not wrong for Blair to be chummy with George W Bush. That was necessary statecraft, especially for someone who had been so close to Bill Clinton. The error was to imagine that British public opinion didn’t want him to do anything else. Blair always exaggerated the extent to which the mood of British politics was downstream from that of America. It led him not just to misread Bush but to misread the British view of Bush, in the end disastrously. In today’s different circumstances, May is herself treading very close to the edge. The British dislike Trump. They want him to stop disrespecting Nato and international norms. They will soon learn that the US approach to trade is “the American way or no way”, especially now. To talk, as May does, about the Brexiting UK and Trump’s US “leading together again” is the language of pure folly. It is a reminder of how much damage Brexit is doing to the national interest. And she shouldn’t make it worse. If May thinks that waving a piece of paper signed by Trump offering a US trade deal will be viewed as a triumph, she is wrong. It could make her not the new Margaret Thatcher, but the new Neville Chamberlain.', 'When Americans were asked who they would prefer as president, only seven percentage points separated Barack Obama and Donald Trump.\\nIn a survey released from Public Policy Polling on Thursday morning, 51% of respondents chose Obama, 44% chose Trump and 4% said they were “not sure” who they would prefer. If those numbers suggest Trump is doing well in the race to succeed Obama in the White House, however, the other results gathered from the 933 likely voters tell a different story. Hillary Clinton was five percentage points ahead of Trump, with 49% of support in a question about voting intention compared to Trump’s 44%. Perhaps that was because most of those surveyed felt Clinton “won the first presidential debate” – 31% said they thought Trump won and 14% said they weren’t sure. I think Trump did surprisingly well given the result from question No9. It asked: “Which candidate for president do you think would be more likely to cause a nuclear war?” In answer, 49% replied Trump and 31% said Clinton. But let’s not forget the 20% who said they weren’t sure which candidate could provoke an apocalyptic war. The truth so often forgotten in all such horse-race analysis is that neither candidate comes off well in surveys like this. People might vote on 8 November but they will probably hold their noses while doing so: 52% of people in the Public Policy Polling survey said they had an unfavorable view of Clinton and 55% said they had an unfavorable view of Trump.
