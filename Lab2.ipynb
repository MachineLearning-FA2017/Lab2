The first and possibly still the most famous American presidential debate pitted the telegenic Democrat John F Kennedy against Republican vice-president Richard Nixon. The clammy Nixon was recovering from illness and had a five o’clock shadow but refused makeup. TV viewers are said to have judged Kennedy the winner, whereas radio listeners gave it to Nixon or called it a draw. Kennedy won a narrow election. He was assassinated three years later.\\n1976: Republican president Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon after the Watergate scandal, had been closing the gap on Democrat Jimmy Carter but then remarked: “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.” It was seen as a critical gaffe in the context of the cold war and Carter went on to win the election.\\n1980: Carter accused Republican Ronald Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for the elderly. Reagan, who had complained that Carter was misrepresenting his positions on numerous issues, said with a chuckle: “There you go again.” The audience erupted. The duel attracted 80.6 million viewers, the most ever for a presidential debate, according to Nielsen, though Clinton v Trump is expected to shatter that record.\\n1984: Reagan, at 73 the oldest president in US history, took the sting out of the issue of his age during the second debate with Democratic candidate Walter Mondale, 56, with this line: “I want you to know that, also, I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” Reagan was re-elected.\\n1988: Democrat Michael Dukakis, taking on Republican vice-president George HW Bush, was asked whether he would support the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. “No, I don’t, Bernard,” the Massachusetts governor replied. “And I think you know that I’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life.” He was criticised as cold and unemotional and lost the election.\\n1988: In the vice-presidential debate, Bush’s running mate Dan Quayle compared himself with John F Kennedy. Democratic senator Lloyd Bentsen replied shot back: “Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy.” It is probably the most famous line ever uttered in a vice-presidential debate and has been much parodied since.\\n1992: In a three-way contest with Democrat Bill Clinton and businessman Ross Perot, President George HW Bush made the fatal mistake of looking his watch. It gave the impression of a haughty, aloof incumbent who did not want to be there and took too much for granted. Bush later admitted what had been on his mind: “Only 10 more minutes of this crap.” He lost to Clinton.\\n2000: Democratic vice-president Al Gore went into the debate leading in the polls but sighed loudly when his rival, Republican George W Bush, spoke. In another incident, he was criticised for invading Bush’s personal space when Bush strolled forward and Gore rose and moved towards his rival, as if looking for a fight. Bush dismissed him with a nod and won a close and bitterly disputed election.\\n2012: President Barack Obama was widely felt to have “phoned in” his first lacklustre debate performance against Republican Mitt Romney, who performed above expectations. But in the second debate, Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had “binders full of women” as candidates for Cabinet posts.

I would do anything for change, but I won’t do that. Well before the 1993 election, Hewson, an economist, presented what was then a radical and detailed policy change in his Fightback! package. It included a goods and services tax, a Medicare co-payment and an end to the dole for the longer-term unemployed.\\nBy contrast, Paul Keating, a long-term treasurer who had been prime minister for less than 18 months, developed a political and economic plan that contained ironclad, L-A-W tax cuts. Three years before Pauline Hanson’s political career began, Keating dubbed his plan One Nation. The contest in March 1993 became the True Believers’ election, when Keating surprised everyone, including his own cabinet, by increasing his majority from eight to 13 seats. Voters were to receive only half the L-A-W tax cuts – with the rest delivered via superannuation. After a tough budget, the government slumped and began the long slide to the 1996 Howard victory.\\nBut the 1992-93 cabinet documents, released on 1 January by the National Archives, show a government still proposing economic change around industrial relations, women’s participation, childcare reform and superannuation, but also moving to substantial social change. The documents only cover advice going into cabinet and not the discussions held within. (In the same years, cabinet agreed to close the notebooks of those conversations for 50 years.) In many ways, the early 90s set up many of the debates that continue today, as government started to reach out to identifiable groups. The Mabo native title issue was resolved with much political sweat and capital from Keating. The rights of the more marginalised came to the fore, with changes aimed at promoting women’s participation in the workforce, the lifting of the ban on gay and lesbian people in the defence forces and adding vilification as an offence to the Racial Discrimination Act. Keating had announced in 1992 that there would be no more recommendations for British awards such as knights and dames. In the same year, cabinet agreed to change the oath of allegiance to “modernise the way citizens give expression to their commitment to Australia”, removing the reference to swearing allegiance to the Queen. The submission noted that the move was expected to be welcomed by many, although with strong criticism from anti-republican groups. Keating began to prosecute a fierce brand of nationalism, accusing Hewson and John Howard of a cultural cringe and “tugging the forelock” to Britain after Hewson suggested the prime minister had never learned respect at school.\\n“I learned about self-respect and self-regard for Australia – not about some cultural cringe to a country which decided not to defend the Malayan peninsula, not to worry about Singapore and not to give us our troops back to keep ourselves free from Japanese domination,” Keating said in parliament. “This was the country that you people wedded yourself to, and even as it walked out on you and joined the Common Market, you were still looking for your MBEs and your knighthoods, and all the rest of the regalia that comes with it. “You would take Australia right back down the time tunnel to the cultural cringe where you have always come from.” The following year, Keating appointed Malcolm Turnbull to head the republic advisory committee, to consider the various options open to Australia were it to decide to replace the Queen as head of state.\\nThe committee reported options but at the 1996 election Howard promised a people’s convention, which was held in 1998. He then took an option to a constitutional referendum, at which the republic was defeated. Women were receiving special attention in budget papers under the eye of Keating’s political adviser Anne Summers, who was brought in after polls showed the prime minister had low support among women. Policies were assessed on how they would affect women and there was recognition in cabinet that “future growth in the economy will be highly dependent on women’s participation”. That started to drive education and childcare policies. Cabinet removed the right to dismiss women on the grounds of family responsibility and approved a move to allow complaints of discrimination against women in the workplace to go to the sex discrimination commissioner.\\nMinisters also considered laws on racial vilification and violence in response to a national inquiry into racist violence and the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. The then attorney general, Michael Duffy, reported to cabinet that while racial violence in Australia was nowhere near the levels in Europe, there was no cause for complacency. While he recommended against creating specific laws for racial violence, he recommended laws for racial vilification would play a role in educating the community. “By proscribing certain beliefs and acts as antisocial, warranting the imposition of legal sanctions for a breach of community standards in this regard, we would deny emphatically whatever legitimacy may have been afforded so far to racist views because of government inaction and community indifference,” Duffy wrote. Echoing the concerns in the current debate over section 18C, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet supported the recommendations about vilification but warned against support of the creation of a criminal offence for “dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred”. “The wording of the proposed offence will have to be very carefully considered to ensure that the restriction on freedom of speech, which it necessarily involves, only goes as far as necessary to achieve the desired aim,” the department advised. The Racial Hatred Act 1994 passed the following year amid a public debate every bit as controversial as the current debate around 18C.

While none of the moderators named on Friday has hosted a general-election presidential debate before, all four moderated primary debates this year. The Commission on Presidential Debates additionally named a moderator for this year’s single vice-presidential debate, CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano. She has never hosted a debate. Moderating can be thankless work. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, criticized Candy Crowley of CNN after she spot-checked his claim on a debate stage in New York that Barack Obama had failed to refer to the 2012 Benghazi attacks as a “terror” attack. “She obviously thought it was her job to play a more active role in the debate than was agreed upon by the two candidates,” Romney later said. More recently, Trump complained for months about Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who asked him during the first Republican primary debate last August about his views on women, quoting his own words back to him, which Trump claimed was unfair. Who are the moderators? Let’s not overlook the break-glass-in-case-of-emergency backup moderator for these debates, C-Span’s Steve Scully. In fact, let’s start with him. Scully is C-Span’s senior executive producer, White House and political editor. Scully, who has a reputation for being irreproachably even-handed, was born in Pennsylvania, served on the board of White House Correspondents’ Association, and has worked for over three decades at C-Span. He has been hailed by comedian John Oliver as the most patient man on television:\\nHere are the rest of this year’s moderators: Lester Holt Anchor, NBC Nightly News – moderator of the first presidential debate on 26 September\\nHolt, a popular figure in his own newsroom and beyond, rose to the anchor chair of NBC’s flagship evening news program after former host Brian Williams was suspended last year for misrepresenting a story. Claims for Williams’ indispensability were undercut when the ratings climbed under Holt. He moderated a Democratic primary debate in January. Martha Raddatz Chief global affairs correspondent and co-anchor of This Week, ABC News – moderator, with Anderson Cooper, of the second presidential debate on 9 October\\nRaddatz, a specialist in military affairs, has perhaps the most debate hosting experience of the bunch, having moderated the 2012 vice-presidential debate and two 2016 primary debates, one for each party. Purveyors of conspiracy theories (ie Breitbart) complained in 2012 that Raddatz’s impartiality was subverted by the fact that Barack Obama had attended Raddatz’s wedding – 25 years ago, before Obama was an elected anything. Conservative id-keeper Matt Drudge is keeping up that line this morning:\\nAnderson Cooper Anchor, CNN Sunday – moderator, with Martha Raddatz, of the second presidential debate on 9 October\\nMore than the other moderators, Cooper’s star power transcends his work as a news host. He also had a syndicated talkshow, Anderson Live, he did a voiceover on Broadway, he’s the author of a bestselling memoir and he has a vocal fanbase. Cooper hosted two Democratic primary debates and one forum. Chris Wallace Anchor, Fox News Sunday – moderator of the third presidential debate on 19 October\\nA decorated journalist currently parked at Fox News with three Emmys and the Dupont-Columbia Silver Baton award to his credit. A must-watch for Sunday show aficionados on Fox, and a former moderator of Meet the Press. His reputation for even-handedness is perhaps bolstered by his former voter registration as a Democrat.\\nElaine Quijano Anchor, CBSN and correspondent, CBS News – moderator of the vice-presidential debate on 4 October\\nA veteran of the White House, Pentagon and supreme court beats and a former CNN talent, Quijano anchors politics coverage on CBSN, the live-streaming digital version of CBS News.

Clinton focused on Trump’s record with women – a topic he forcefully avoided. However, he did push back on moderators’ questions regarding his tax returns, blaming Clinton for allowing the tax loopholes in the first place. Combined with Clinton’s emails and the WikiLeaks revelations, the candidates spent 45 minutes – equivalent to half of a debate – discussing the scandals that they’re embroiled in. Evidently, their debating styles differed. While Clinton was more likely to stay on one topic each time it was mentioned, both candidates attempted to pivot the discussion when less favorable issues were raised. When Trump was asked about his treatment of women or his questionable tax returns, he would revert to a range of his favorite talking points such as Isis or Clinton’s emails. In the second debate, for instance, Trump mentioned Isis six times in response to a question from Anderson Cooper on the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump said he would grab a woman’s genitals without her consent. Clinton avoided tough questions about her use of a private email server or the content of numerous emails from her inner circle released by WikiLeaks by highlighting Trump’s relationship with Russia. Clinton mentioned Putin or Russia seven times in one response in the third debate when asked by Chris Wallace about a speech she gave to a Brazilian bank that was released by WikiLeaks. The economy consistently ranks among the most important topics for voters, often followed closely by national security and terrorism. In this respect, the candidates’ focus on the debates was closely aligned with public interest. However, the supreme court is one of the most divisive issues, especially for conservatives voters conflicted on whether to vote for Trump, and it only featured prominently once in the third debate.

Having looked as if she might be contemplating a rethink, Theresa May unveiled an apparently decisive approval just before the Conservative Party conference. But with longstanding issues still unaddressed – and new problems emerging even since the PM’s announcement – the debate over Hinkley is far from over. Now might be a good moment, then, to reflect on the contribution that social science can make to these kinds of controversies over science and technology. Of course, what counts as useful in any given controversy will depend on your perspective. It is inherent to democracy that different values and interests yield contrasting conclusions. This is especially so over deeply-fractured faultlines like those which run through the UK’s commitments to nuclear power. Social science can provide a better understanding of why different perspectives disagree – and help (when possible) to identify common ground. Hard-pressed policymakers often find it useful to understand how to foster trust, confidence and “acceptance” of their institutions and procedures. For powerful interests in any setting, social research can also play a useful role in helping to justify, present or implement favoured policies. Here, social science can be part of the closing down of debate – helpfully enabling political attention to move on. But what if, on deeper reflection, powerfully-backed policies are a bad idea (perhaps as with the Hinkley decision? History is replete with examples – like asbestos, heavy metals, carcinogenic pesticides, chlorine bleaches, toxic solvents and ozone depleting chemicals – where it only emerged in retrospect that the pictures being given of “sound science” or the “evidence base” at the time were unduly shaped by vested interests or constrained imaginations. It is here that social science can play a further crucial role: helping to open up policy debates where they are being prematurely “locked-in”. This focuses less on society as a target for policymaking, and more on the processes of policymaking themselves. The production and interpretation of evidence is, after all, as much a social phenomenon as public attitudes or political mobilisation. It is a striking feature of the Hinkley example that even the government’s own evidence base is strikingly damning. The assessment of value for money itself acknowledges Hinkley C to be more expensive than other low carbon energy strategies. And the picture in other official sources is even more negative. With nuclear costs rising and renewable costs falling – and a worldwide turn towards wind and solar power – global trends compound the picture. With the UK enjoying the best renewable energy resource in Europe and holding a competitive advantage in offshore industries, industrial policy arguments are also manifestly stronger for renewables. The same applies to prospective jobs. Compared to nuclear safety and security challenges, renewables are less vulnerable. And simplistic “baseload” arguments are shown by numerous official reports to be superseded by technology – and repudiated even by the National Grid. So the officially-stated reasons for nuclear enthusiasm simply don’t stack up. The contrast with Germany is especially strong. Here, arguably the world’s most successful industrial power had a nuclear sector far larger and more successful than that of the UK, and a much less attractive renewable resource. Yet it is Germany – with a record of far-sighted industrial policy decisions in the past – that has made the opposite move to the UK: an “Energiewende” towards renewable energy, in contrast to the British “nuclear renaissance”. So, here emerges another role for social science: critical interrogation of what lies behind the official picture. Our own recent research on the Hinkley question suggests the best way to understand this continuing commitment – and the contrast with Germany – lies in the relative qualities of the two democracies. The post-war German constitution, and a more critical political culture, makes it easier for Germany to resist incumbent industrial interests and ease itself out of lock-in. And our research suggests there is a further – seriously neglected – factor that may underlie the intense attachment of successive UK governments to civil nuclear power. This involves parallel UK commitments to maintain nuclear submarine capabilities. Without the cover provided by lower-tier contracts in civil nuclear construction, the diminished UK nuclear manufacturing sector would simply not be able to build these formidable technological artefacts. Nor could they easily be operated without civil infrastructures for nuclear research, design, training, maintenance and regulation. So a consequence of withdrawing from nuclear power might also be very serious for a particular version of British identity – especially in the coming post-Brexit era. It is nuclear military prowess that supposedly allows the UK to “punch above its weight” on the world stage. Yet, although this rationale for continued UK nuclear commitments is clearly documented on the military side, it is unmentioned anywhere in official civil nuclear policy statements – and in energy debates more widely. What this might mean for policy is a moot point. But by opening up this kind of wider discussion, social science can undertake its trickiest – but arguably most useful – task in any controversy. The stakes in this particular case transcend nuclear debates alone – and raise questions about the overall health of British democracy.

Ignoring this issue would be more understandable if this metaphorical pachyderm weren’t about to rampage through the lives of Americans, causing upheaval on a scale not seen since the start of human civilization. “I’ve been shocked at the lack of questions on climate change. It really is fiddling while the world burns,” said Kerry Emanuel, a leading climate scientist. “This is the great issue of our time and we are skirting around it. I’m just baffled by it.” Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have yet to face a moderator question on climate change during two debates in which time was found to grill Clinton repeatedly over her use of emails and to ask Trump about a series of late-night tweets he sent about a former Miss Universe’s sex tape. Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, was reportedly set to ask a climate question but ran out of time. Wednesday’s final debate is set to retread the same ground, with the debate referee, Chris Wallace of Fox News, planning to prod the candidates on immigration, the economy and “fitness to be president”. Wallace has also decided to ask about “foreign hot spots”, but it appears unlikely that it will segue into talking about the diabolical heat suffered in Kuwait and India this year. “It’s like a sort of collective cowardice,” said Emanuel of the omission. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, added: “One has to wonder if television networks are compromised by the millions of advertising dollars they take from fossil fuel interests.”\\nShould the final debate also neglect climate, the only question related to the issue across four-and-a-half hours of TV will have come from Ken Bone, he of red sweater and short-lived internet fame, who asked about coal mining policy as the credits were preparing to roll on last week’s debate. Climate campaigners have been unable to contain their exasperation. “Let’s be clear: a last minute question about energy doesn’t do justice to the threat of the climate crisis,” said May Boeve, executive director of climate group 350 Action, shortly after the debate. “This crisis threatens our communities, our economy, and the future for our children – we saw that threat with Hurricane Matthew just this week – yet climate change doesn’t get a single direct question in the debate.” Hurricane Matthew, which resulted in more than 20 deaths, is just the latest example of the type of extreme event, from flooding in Louisiana to a historic drought in California, that will become more common as the world warms. This year hasn’t exactly been short of climate conversation topics – 2016 is on track to be the warmest on record, beating a mark set just in 2015. The Paris climate accord has been ratified by countries around the world while the Obama administration has attempted to implement its Clean Power Plan in the teeth of fierce opposition from 27 states. Alaska barely had a winter this year while some American communities are already having to relocate due to rising seas. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that climate change is at least somewhat important to them personally, according to the Yale Program on Climate Communication, although few people talk about the issue with family or friends. Americans are broadly in favor of developing clean sources of energy but there’s a clear political divide about how to approach climate change. Polling by the Pew Research Center shows half of Clinton’s supporters care about climate change a great deal, compared with 15% of Trump supporters. This division is most starkly demonstrated by the candidates themselves. Clinton has talked about installing half a billion solar panels, halting oil drilling in the Arctic and, in sobering evidence of this election’s debasement, proudly told the Democratic national convention: “I believe in science.” While some liberal Democrats are suspicious of Clinton’s climate credentials – fears were exacerbated by recent leaked emails that show she said those who wanted to shut down fossil fuels should “get a life” – the former secretary of state’s plan cannot be compared meaningfully with Trump’s. The Republican nominee has called climate change a Chinese hoax and “bullshit”. He has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal, revive the coal industry while also expanding oil and gas drilling. He has darkly hinted at scrapping the Environmental Protection Agency and resurrecting the controversial Keystone oil pipeline. “I wish there was a proper battle of ideas that we could judge accordingly,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Green groups have supported Clinton almost as a default position because she’s the only major party candidate who accepts climate science. While Clinton and Trump differ on issues such as police shootings, immigration and the economy, both candidates at least accept that these things actually exist. It’s tricky to have a debate on a topic that a participant doesn’t think is real. Trump’s denial is shared by many members of Congress, who have been lavished with $29.6m in contributions from fossil fuel companies in the 2016 election cycle, according to figures compiled by ClimateTruth.org Action. Regardless, here are three germane, and pressing, climate change questions that Wallace could ask: An overwhelming majority of climate scientists say that climate change is real, caused by humans and a growing threat to our way of life. What would you do as president to tackle this clear and present danger? All of the top 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 1998, the year when many climate skeptics claim that global warming somehow stopped. The world’s top scientific institutions are unequivocal that the burning of fossil fuels is the cause of this warming, with recent research showing this brings punishing drought, extreme weather events, poverty and economic stagnation. The Pentagon has said that climate change is a national security risk due to the destruction caused by rising seas and displacement of people. What would you do to prepare the US for this? Millions of people are set to become climate refugees as crops fail and drinking water supplies are sullied by seawater, potentially putting the current refugee crisis in the shade. The Pentagon has warned of the potential for conflict and the need for humanitarian mobilization but the two main presidential candidates have yet to talk about this. Rising sea levels are already causing Americans to be uprooted and whole cities to be put at long-term risk. What national plan will you put in place to ensure that areas such as New York, Virginia and Florida aren’t inundated? Incidents of nuisance flooding have more than trebled along US coasts since the 1960s, with most coastal areas set to be inundated 30 days or more a year by 2050. Miami Beach is spending $400m on a system of pumps to ward off the sea for just a few decades, according to its mayor. Climate change is far from an abstract concept for people in towns in Louisiana and Alaska who are being relocated due to the rising seas.', 'elements': [{'type': 'text', 'assets': [], 'textTypeData': {'html': '<p>Climate change has been the elephant in the room during the past two US presidential debates.

These are the TV debates that will take place before polling day on 23 June. EU: In or Out with David Cameron, Thursday 2 June Sky News, 8pm Cameron has made it clear he is not prepared to argue against fellow Conservatives, so will be interviewed and answer questions alone. The programme will be split between a face-to-face live interview with the Sky News political editor, Faisal Islam, and a question and answer session in front of a live studio audience, moderated by newsreader Kay Burley. EU: In or Out with Michael Gove, Friday 3 June Sky News, 8pm Gove, the justice secretary and a key figure in the leave campaign, will face the same Sky News format 24 hours after Cameron. #InOutLive Sunday 5 June Facebook, 5pm A youth-focused debate without politicians and hosted by Michael Sani, chief executive of Bite the Ballot, will be streamed live on Facebook. Debating the pros and cons of the EU will be YouTuber Jamal Edwards, Unilad chief executive Liam Harrington, singer Eliza Doolittle and TV controversialist Katie Hopkins. Members of Full Fact will be doing live fact-checking and, where necessary, correcting claims made by the participants.\\nCameron and Farage Live: The EU Referendum, Tuesday 7 June ITV1, 9pm The prime minister has said he is not prepared to share a platform with Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, so each will have 30 minutes of questions from a live studio audience of 200 people, moderated by newsreader Julie Etchingham. The debate is likely to be uncomfortable for some on the Brexit side because Farage is not part of the official Vote Leave campaign, who accused ITV of letting Cameron pick his opponent to avoid any more “blue on blue” debates. The ITV Referendum Debate, Thursday 9 June ITV1, 8pm Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has confirmed she will take part, representing the remain camp, in the two-hour programme that will be similar to the general election leaders’ debates. Participants will give short speeches and then take questions from the audience. Boris Johnson is widely expected to appear to argue the case for a vote to leave. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, and shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, are among those who have been tipped to join Sturgeon in arguing the remain case. #EURef Town Hall Live, Friday 10 June Buzzfeed and Facebook, various times Cameron and Farage will be quizzed again by 100 members of the public at the Buzzfeed event moderated by the website’s political editor, Jim Waterson, and correspondent Emily Ashton. Penny Mordaunt, the Tory minister, will make the case for leave at 2pm, Nicola Sturgeon will do the same for remain at 3pm, followed by Farage for leave at 4pm. Cameron takes the stage at 5pm. The EU debate Tuesday 14 June The Telegraph, Huffington Post UK and YouTube, 7pm Boris Johnson and the Tory minister Priti Patel will make the case for leave, versus the SNP’s Alex Salmond and the former Labour leadership contender Liz Kendall. The 90-minute debate will have a live audience of Telegraph and HuffPost readers at YouTube’s headquarters and will be streamed live on the websites. Question Time EU Referendum Special with Michael Gove, Wednesday 15 June BBC1, 6.45pm In the first of the two programmes, Gove will put the case for the UK leaving the EU to a Question Time audience in Nottingham, moderated by David Dimbleby. Question Time EU Referendum Special with David Cameron, Sunday 19 June BBC1, 6.45pm Cameron will take questions on the arguments to retain EU membership, live in Milton Keynes, with Dimbleby moderating again.\\nEU In or Out with Jeremy Corbyn Monday 20 June Sky News, 6pm The Labour leader’s only live set-piece television appearance of the campaign will follow the same format as Gove and Cameron’s appearances. He will be spend the first 30 minutes being interviewed by Faisal Islam and another half hour taking questions from the live studio audience in west London. EU Referendum: The Great Debate at Wembley Arena, Tuesday 21 June BBC1, 8pm This will be the biggest event of the referendum campaign, with Sadiq Khan, the London mayor who is backing remain, the only confirmed name. Boris Johnson is likely to be the headline act for Vote Leave. Both Cameron and George Osborne are believed to have ruled out participating. More than 6,000 members of the public will be at the event, moderated by Dimbleby, the Today programme’s Mishal Husain and Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis.
