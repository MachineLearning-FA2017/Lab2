      "['European Union exit and trade (European affairs) sub-committee PM I went to Brussels. Met the EU leaders. They wanted to know our plan. I had nothing to tell them. Foreign secretary Rome wasn’t built in a day. PM We need a plan. The EU wants to know the plan. Parliament wants to know the plan. It has been four frigging months! No plan! I’m beginning to wonder if this will be over in my lifetime. Foreign secretary Probably not. How old are you, actually? PM You three ran the leave campaign. I assumed you had some idea what to do. Foreign secretary Nope. Trade minister The Great Repeal bill will solve the problem. PM No. EU-related law constitutes more than one-sixth of our statutes. I’m told there are 12,295 EU regulations concerning consumer and banking rules and food-safety standards. The bill will simply transfer all those EU rules into UK law.

Foreign secretary It took 40 years to get into this mess; it could take as long\\xa0to get out.

Foreign secretary Oh, ye of little faith!', 'Brexit was the defining political issue in the UK in 2016, unseating a prime minister and unsettling MPs, but the shockwaves unleashed by voters’ decision to leave the European Union will reverberate over the next 12 months and beyond. The soaring rhetoric of the Brexiters on sovereignty, control and freedom was the constant refrain of political debate in 2016, but it had already begun to be replaced by more prosaic practicalities as the year drew to a close,. Things are due to get real, and fast. Theresa May has promised to give a speech early in the new year setting out the government’s approach to its Brexit negotiations. These will follow automatically the triggering of article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, something she intends to do before the end of March.\\nIn January, the supreme court will rule on whether the prime minister can invoke article 50 without consulting parliament. If the 11 justices uphold the high court’s judgment, the government will have to push legislation through both houses of parliament in time to meet her self-imposed deadline for beginning the formal process of leaving the EU. That is likely to create plenty of drama at Westminster. The next act, however, will take place far away from London, in Brussels and across the capitals of the EU member states, as leaders decide what kind of Brexit deal they are willing to offer against the backdrop of their own domestic battles. Several forks in the road appear to be inevitable. The other 27 members of the single market seem determined to uphold the principle of the free movement of labour if Britain is to retain other benefits such as free movement of goods, capital and services.\\nEuropean national elections may test this resolve. The Dutch election on 15 March is predicted to leave the anti-immigration Geert Wilders in charge of the largest party if not a coalition government. Marine Le Pen presents a similar longshot challenge in the first round of the French presidential election on 23 April and possibly in the 27 May run-off. Little real negotiation on Brexit seems likely though before the results of German federal electionsin the autumn. It would take a political earthquake to shake the EU’s determination to extract a steep price for Britain leaving the club. British opposition to internal migrants is of a very different nature to the external flows raising concerns elsewhere in Europe. The ideological forces unleashed by the referendum debate will continue to shape politics at home. By promising to crack down on immigration after leaving the EU and deliver a “red, white and blue Brexit”, May hopes to become the flag-bearer for leave voters who signalled their anger at a complacent establishment.\\nUkip’s new leader, Paul Nuttall, will seek to harness the concerns of working class voters who fear Westminster will row back on the decision made last June. For Labour, the Brexit debate exposed and deepened the divide between the party’s traditional heartlands and its liberal, metropolitan wing. Tensions in the parliamentary party may have become less overt since Jeremy Corbyn soundly defeated Owen Smith’s leadership challenge, but the electoral squeeze the party faces remains formidable. The scale of the potential threat - whether from Ukip, May’s pro-Brexit Tories or the ardently pro-remain Liberal Democrats - is likely to become clearer early in 2017, with the Copeland by-election, the May mayoral races and local elections all providing key tests. The British state will also have to begin flexing muscles it has long forgotten how to use, whether in drawing up an independent agricultural policy, negotiating our own trade deals or deciding how to manage migration from the rest of Europe. For the time being, other pressing political issues and ambitious social reform plans will simply have to wait.', 'The six-week holiday may have gone some way to concentrating the mind, but it has done little to clarify the thinking. Brexit remains as gnomic now as it did back in July. “The reason I’ve been saying Brexit means Brexit is precisely because it means it does,” said Theresa May, pioneering a new branch of illogical positivism during a rather tetchy press conference at the G20 summit in China. What Brexit had appeared to mean at the G20 was the prime minister getting shunted to the back row of the leaders’ group photo, being briefed against by the Americans and the Japanese and being left to big up the fact that Mexico, Australia and Singapore have expressed a vague interest in doing trade deals with the UK. It’s a start, I suppose. If not the one that May would have been hoping for. Nor was there any real enlightenment on the meaning of Brexit to be found in the Commons as Brexit minister David Davis gave his first lack-of-progress report. This was Davis’s first outing on the government front bench for more than 19 years and he came to the house flanked by Boris Johnson and Liam Fox as his security blanket. This unexpected show of unity was quickly explained; none of them have yet actually done anything to fall out over. Give it time. Quite a long time, to judge by Davis’s statement. “Britain voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU,” he began. In Brexitworld a 52-48 vote is a total landslide. “So Brexit means Brexit means Britain leaving the EU.” It wasn’t long before the Labour benches started laughing and shouting, “Waffle, waffle.” Davis took this as an instruction rather than a criticism. “We will be creating beacons and roundtables of organisations,” he waffled on. “There will be challenges but these are opportunities and everything will basically be fine once we’ve got round to thinking about it with the brightest and best minds in Whitehall, though obviously there can be no room for complacency.” “Is that it?” interrupted the SNP’s Pete Wishart. Davis nodded. That was about it, though he was more than happy to repeat himself for another five minutes or so before concluding that he would be returning to parliament at regular intervals to give updates on everything that wasn’t happening. When Emily Thornberry was first appointed shadow minister for Brexit alongside her day job as shadow foreign secretary it looked as if the reason she had been made to double up was because Jeremy Corbyn hadn’t been able to find anyone else willing to do it. Now the duplication looks more like an act of genius. Why bother to have a separate shadow minister for a department that wasn’t likely to be doing very much for the foreseeable future? “So far all we’ve learnt about Brexit is that the government is not going to introduce a points-based immigration system or give £350m per week to the NHS,” she observed. “Both of which were two of the key Vote Leave promises in the referendum campaign. The government has gone from gross negligence to rank incompetence. You’re making this up as you’re going along.” Davis took this as a compliment. A sign that he was really getting to grips with the job and that progress was being made. Even if only by a process of elimination. “We’re definitely not going to have a point-based system because that is what the prime minister said yesterday,” he declared. “What we are going to have is a results-based system that might be even tougher.” There again, it might not. It was precisely to sort out these kinds of details that he would be consulting roundtables and beacons. Thereafter, the house divided on predictably partisan lines. Those on the remain side wanted to get to grips with the nitty gritty of what access to the single market Britain would get, how EU laws would be repealed and whether Britain would remain signed up to Europol. Those on the leave side thought such things were minor niggles and what really mattered was sticking two fingers up to the Frogs and the Hun and returning sovereignty to parliament. Though not to the extent of giving parliament a vote on the details – should any ever emerge – of the Brexit negotiations reached as it might vote against it. “Is that it?” several more MPs enquired. “Is that it?” Davis echoed. He’s been on the back benches for so long he hasn’t quite appreciated he’s now supposed to be answering the questions not asking them. Not quite. There was just time for newspaper columnist Michael Gove to declare that everything was going far better than “the soi-disant experts with oeuf on their face” had predicted and begging the minister never to consult anyone who might know what they were talking about. So far, that’s the one promise Davis has been able to keep.', 'First the triumph, then the hubris. David Davis may never have been quite at the delusional Liam Fox end of the spectrum but he was certainly one of the more gung-ho Eurosceptics and his early statements as minister for Brexit tended to be along the lines of “The EU are a bunch of thieving foreigners and the sooner we’re rid of them the better”. Now that he’s been in the job for a few months, he’s begun to show signs of realising it’s all going to be a bit trickier than he had imagined. The smile is still just about in place, but the face is more care-worn. “Would you consider yourself one of the thoughtful politicians?” asked chair Hilary Benn, at the start of Davis’s first appearance before his Brexit select committee, echoing chancellor Philip Hammond’s remarks earlier in the week that all thoughtful politicians believed transitional arrangements would be required once the two-year negotiating period was up. Davis thought about this for a while, before coming to the conclusion that though he may not yet be thoughtful he had moved up the synaptic food chain to totally indecisive. Which was progress of a sort. He couldn’t say when the government would have a plan other than it definitely wouldn’t be within the next month as he had 57 sectoral analyses to complete. Some of which were barely under way. Nor could he promise a white paper, nor how many pages the plan would be. It all depended on the font size. “We just want everything to run smoothly,” he said, hoping that platitudes might be mistaken for thoughtfulness. “What if everything can’t be negotiated within 18 months?” Benn pressed on, more out of duty than from any expectation of enlightenment. “Will transitional arrangements be implemented then?” “Transitional means a lot of things to different people,” Davis blustered. “Are you opposed to transitional arrangements?” Benn said, only just resisting the urge to head-butt the table. “That depends on what you mean by transitional.” Being this thoughtful was turning out to be hard work. “It’s on record...” “I never gossip,” insisted Davis. At which point even he realised he had gone too far, as the Brexit minister has a reputation for doing little but. “Do you worry about going over a cliff edge?” Davis closed his eyes. He wasn’t really sure if he was meant to be that bothered about going over a cliff edge or not. Obviously it wouldn’t be a great idea to rush headlong off the cliff but if everyone was to line up in an orderly fashion and then jump off the cliff, surely that couldn’t be too bad? “I don’t know if we would have transitional plans as such but we might have some implementation plans that we would implement if we needed to implement them,” he said, pensively. The longer the session went on, the vaguer Davis became. Something no one in the room had previously believed possible. On the customs union there weren’t just four general spectrums to think about, there were also a multitude of little-known side spectrums. On immigration he wasn’t prepared to commit to anything. If Britain needed some Nobel prize-winning fruit pickers then let them come. Now that he had come to think of it, taking back control could just mean taking back control to increase immigration. At the same time as reducing it, obviously. Michael Gove started twitching, unable to believe that one of his fellow Brexiteers was showing every sign of going over to the Dark Side of the Remoaners. And when Davis started to talk about how the EU negotiation would be a two-way process and that Britain wouldn’t necessarily be able to dictate the terms on which it left, Gove could control himself no longer. “We can do whatever we want,” he ranted. “The EU needs us far more than we need them.” Exterminate. Exterminate. Benn summoned a nurse to administer Mikey with a sedative. It had been a long afternoon for everyone. Enough was enough.', 'Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain edges towards the EU exit.

The second episode of Brexit Means…, our new Brexit podcast, is out now; Jolyon Maugham QC, professor of EU law Philip Syrpis and the Guardian’s Owen Bowcott and Jennifer Rankin join me to discuss the legal challenges to the government’s use of Article 50, and what happens when it’s triggered. You can listen to that here. Producing the Guardian’s independent, in-depth journalism takes a lot of time and money. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – and it might well be your perspective too. If you value our Brexit coverage, become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you. The big picture This is the last Guardian weekly Brexit briefing of the year (we’ll be back in the first week of January). It’s almost six months since the referendum. And still no one knows what “Brexit means Brexit” will actually mean. Appearing before the Commons’ new Brexit select committee last week, David Davis said there were still “quite a few decisions to be made” about the government plan, which would be published as soon as possible but “certainly not next month”. The Brexit secretary said he was supremely confident the talks, which he apparently hopes will combine the article 50 negotiations and discussion of a future trade deal, could be wrapped up in 18 months. That’s despite the fact that, by his own admission, pretty much “everything is negotiable” except Britain taking full control of immigration: in or out of the customs union (there are four broad options), transitional deal (only if necessary and once the future relationship is clear), payment for market access (maybe). (Theresa May, reporting back to the Commons on her brief trip to Brussels last week – of which more below – said even less, if that’s possible, although she did repeat her wish that a deal guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals living in Britain and vice versa be agreed “early on”). Meanwhile, the House of Lords released half a dozen reports, some highlighting potentially alarming consequences of Brexit – and of the government’s continuing uncertainty about what it means. The peers said an interim deal on single market access was urgently needed to prevent the loss of tens of thousands of City jobs, and warned new immigration laws could cost London its lead in financial services and start-up technologies. They added that the government had also underestimated the shortcomings in its expertise and the relative weakness of its negotiating position, and was frankly naive to expect a “free lunch” in trade negotiations: The notion that a country can have complete regulatory sovereignty while engaging in comprehensive free trade with partners is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of free trade. Helena Kennedy, the chair of the Lords’ subcommittee looking into acquired rights, warned of “deep anxiety” among EU citizens in the UK and British nationals living on the continent – and called for a unilateral British undertaking to immediately guarantee the rights of the former. The government will presumably now get a brief respite for the Christmas break. But the calls for greater clarity – and for a few fundamental decisions to be taken – will return, louder and more urgent, in the New Year. With Theresa May saying she is determined to trigger article 50 before the end of March, the first three months of 2017 won’t be comfortable. The view from Europe The view from Europe was perhaps never clearer than in a rather sad video from last week’s Brussels summit in which EU 27 leaders laughed, chatted and embraced, while May appeared alone, friendless and with no one to talk to. The image showed once more that the EU 27 have other things on their mind besides Brexit, which featured so high up their agenda that they devoted all of 20 minutes to discussing it at an evening dinner to which May was not invited. To be fair, that’s partly because there’s not a lot they can discuss until article 50 is triggered and the UK says what it wants. Once that happens, many of them reckon – according to the UK’s ambassador to Brussels, Sir Ivan Rogers – that a final EU-UK trade deal could take a decade or more to negotiate, and still fail. An influential German official, meanwhile, said it was “a little bit naive” and “very ambitious” to expect, as some in the government appear to do, that a trade deal can be concluded within two years. Meanwhile, back in Westminster As so often, Westminster’s Brexit week consisted largely of Labour gradually shuffling towards a coherent strategy while government ministers tried to explain as little as possible. David Davis’s appearance before the Brexit select committee (see above) was a fine example of the latter. On the former, the main Labour contribution came a few miles to the east, where his shadow minister Keir Starmer chose the London HQ of Bloomberg – scene of David Cameron’s 2013 announcement that he would hold an EU referendum – to outline his party’s position. It was a tough brief. Labour’s stance on free movement is, to say the least, a broad church, and the best previous explanation of how the party planned to hold the government’s feet to the fire while simultaneously promising to back an article 50 vote whatever happened was by applying “moral pressure”. But, as you might expect from a former barrister and director of public prosecutions, Starmer gave it a good go. Labour had to be the party offering a consensus way between the government’s push towards a hard Brexit and the Lib Dems’ appeal to disaffected remainers, he insisted. This was, he said, “the battle of our times”, and Labour had to do its best to shape Brexit policy using “real opposition in real time”. There are still flaws, but it was the best explanation of the party’s policy yet. Just in time for Christmas, too. You should also know: The British Chambers of Commerce and the TUC made an unprecedented joint demand to Theresa May to guarantee the rights of EU nationals in the UK. The Brexit vote was fuelled by poorer voters feeling they had little control over immigration and general mistrust of politicians and officials, research found. Parliament’s joint committee on human rights said EU nationals in the UK should not be “bargaining chips” and mass deportations would be impossible. Another study found people who have little contact with those from outside their own neighbourhoods were much more likely to have voted Leave. Scottish ministers say they will call a second independence referendum if their concerns about single market membership are brushed aside. On a visit to Japan, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the country’s banks were “concerned” about Brexit. Promises made to the UK fishing industry about its chances of cutting the catch sizes of foreign fleets after Brexit were unrealistic, the Lords said. Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said a transitional deal is “completely inevitable” to avoid losing access to vital European intelligence databases. Lego will raise its UK prices by 5% next year as it becomes the latest firm to respond to the plunging pound after the UK voted to leave the EU. Gus O’Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, would have advised the government against forming two new Brexit departments. Read these: In the Observer, Nick Cohen has an eloquent go at the anger and aggressiveness of some Leavers, the “sore winners... They have the victory, the field is theirs, but still they scream bitter abuse” at Remainers: Why are the Leave campaigners so angry? Because they fear the demagogic rage and charlatan tricks they have used against others will one day be used against them. Andrew Rawnsley reckons a long-drawn-out exit – a “half-in, half-out deal” – would probably suit Britain best, but no one can yet bring themselves to admit it: It would be devilishly difficult to negotiate, but it wouldn’t be inconsistent with the will of a people almost evenly divided by the referendum ... Theresa May probably intuits already that is where she will end up. She just doesn’t dare say so yet. And Aditya Chakrabortty says a “Brexit betrayal” is coming and asks what Leave voters will do when “the broken promises of Brexit” start to pile up. He points to “a multitude of frustrations, pushed through a binary vote” and wonders: What happens when [Leave] voters realise that their vote for change – however loosely defined – means more of the same? When that call to take back control ends up with them playing the same old captive market, there to be ripped off by multinational capital. Who will take the blame then? Tweet of the week: Happy Christmas, one and all, courtesy of Nick Brown MP. See you next year...', 'Tony Blair has said Brexit could still be stopped. Is he right? Theoretically, yes. Theresa May is adamant that Brexit will go ahead when she triggers article 50 before the end of March, and has insisted there will be no second referendum. At the moment it is verging on political heresy to say the UK should not proceed with leaving the EU, because that was the democratic outcome of the referendum. However, there was nothing binding about the vote and no legal obligation for the government to pursue Brexit.\\nHow would it actually happen? The most straightforward technical way of stopping Brexit is to not trigger article 50, which fires the starting gun on two years of negotiations with the EU. After this point, there are conflicting legal views on whether it would be possible to rescind notification that Britain wants to leave. Some, such as Donald Tusk, the EU council president, believe the UK could withdraw its application to leave, but others, including the British government, hold that it would be a one-way track to the exit door. Would any politician actually want to stop Brexit in the next four months? At the moment, the majority of MPs are in favour of respecting the result. There are a few exceptions, including some Liberal Democrats and the former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith, who want another referendum after a deal with the EU has been negotiated; and a handful of diehard remainers, such as the Europhile Tory MP Ken Clarke, who want to halt the process altogether. This could probably only change if there was an obvious shift in the public mood towards staying in. That could push politicians to rethink their fervour for carrying out the “will of the people” in favour of Brexit. However, such a shift is unlikely before the end of March. Is there anything procedural that could stop article 50 being triggered? There is a high court ruling that says parliament must give its approval for Brexit before article 50 can be triggered. The government is appealing against this, but if the judgment stands MPs could theoretically prevent Brexit. It is unlikely, however, that they will do so given that Labour has indicated it will support legislation paving the way for Britain’s exit – likely to be in the form of a three-line parliamentary bill. On the other hand, MPs may try to hold up the process by asking for more details about May’s strategy and demands before giving their approval. While there is a majority of MPs in favour of proceeding with Brexit, there is probably no majority for a hard Brexit involving a clean break with the single market and customs union. What conditions could move the public mood far enough to halt Brexit after that? Economic gloom popularly blamed on Brexit could conceivably cause voters to rethink their support for leaving the EU. In his interview with the New Statesman, Blair suggests this is one of two situations in which people could change their mind about Brexit. He says people might reconsider if the exit terms negotiated with the EU looked so economically damaging that the “pain-gain” ratio made it no longer worthwhile. But there is a strong argument that this would only happen if and when people’s jobs, finances and lives had already started to be affected by an economic slump. The second situation outlined by Blair is that the exit terms negotiated with the EU seem so similar to the status quo that people question whether the UK should bother leaving. This is perhaps a less likely scenario because May has been adamant that she will not accept one of the fundamental pillars of the EU: freedom of movement. At the moment, there appears to be little appetite from EU leaders to change their rules to keep the UK in the bloc, although international politics can shift substantially during two years of negotiations. Would there need to be another referendum to prove voters had changed their minds? Probably, or a general election won by a party campaigning to drop Brexit. The crunch point would come at the point of May returning from Brussels with an exit deal, and if parliament felt the result was not satisfactory and decided to vote it down. It would be difficult for the prime minister to avoid giving the Commons and Lords a vote at this point. If this happened, the prime minister could either try to negotiate a better deal, or decide to bypass parliament by getting her own mandate for the deal. Her choices would be to hold a general election, or run another referendum, either on the terms of the deal, or on whether to proceed with leaving at all, bearing in mind that it is not yet clear that article 50 can be withdrawn once triggered. The decision to call another referendum would be highly contentious and divisive. Leave campaigners would not give up without a fight, especially if there were to be a narrow result in favour of staying in. Could Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland put an end to Brexit? The government does not accept that the devolved administrations have a veto, although it has promised to give them a consultative role in the process of leaving the EU. However, the Scottish and Welsh governments have been allowed to take part in the supreme court appeal, which may determine how much say they have over the Brexit process through their own legislatures. Scotland is the most likely to want to halt Brexit as its voters wanted to stay in the EU. Further down the line, Scottish National party MPs in Westminster could play a role in trying to block any deal done by May, clubbing together with MPs from other parties if they do not like the terms. In Northern Ireland, the ruling Democratic Unionist party is in favour of Brexit but a campaigner for victims of paramilitary violence has won the right to a hearing in the supreme court aimed at blocking Northern Ireland from leaving the EU.', 'The bill to give Theresa May the power to trigger article 50 is at the committee stage after MPs voted it through at a second reading last week. MPs are now debating more than 140 pages of amendments, but the prime minister is unlikely to concede any changes, despite facing a possible Conservative rebellion. On Monday, Labour’s amendments were defeated by the government, but opposition MPs are more hopeful of gaining support from rebel Tories on Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s votes. What is the committee stage? Bills of constitutional importance, such as the article 50 bill, are considered by a committee of the whole house, where all MPs are entitled to contribute. The committee is chaired by the deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle. The debate on the amendments, which fit into six broad categories, will go on until Wednesday afternoon. The categories are: Parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process Devolved administrations: the effect of Brexit on Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland The status of EU citizens in the UK and British expats Parliamentary votes on a final deal or second referendum The publication of impact assessments of leaving the EU and single market Priorities for negotiations Amendments have been tabled by the Labour leadership and Labour backbenchers, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National party and other smaller parties. Two amendments have also been backed by one Conservative MP, Jeremy Lefroy. The prime minister’s spokeswoman has indicated that the government has a strong preference for the short bill to continue as it is, without amendment: We’ve been very clear; we think this should be a straightforward bill about giving the government the power to deliver on the decision of the British people. How will the amendments be considered? This is how we expect the different amendments to be debated. Not all amendments will be voted on – certain amendments will be selected during Speaker’s conference, but may then change in consultation with party whips. The government is facing a potential rebellion over giving parliament a vote on the final deal, and the power to send May back to Brussels to seek a better one, and on the rights of EU citizens. There will be votes on those issues on Tuesday and Wednesday. Monday MPs debated three out of the six categories of amendments, and voted on two of them. Monday’s categories: Parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process Devolved administrations: the effect of Brexit on Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland The status of EU citizens in the UK and British expats Of the dozens of amendments submitted in each category, the Speaker’s conference selected two for votes on parliamentary scrutiny and devolved administrations. Any selected amendments on EU citizens will not be voted on until Wednesday. Parliamentary scrutiny was debated for the first four hours of the debate, followed by EU citizens and then devolved administrations for three hours. Parliamentary scrutiny The Labour leadership tabled an amendment that would require the government to report back to parliament on the progress of Brexit negotiations every two months. Thus far, the government has resisted any formal requirement for this, arguing that ministers are regularly giving parliamentary statements and answering urgent questions. That was defeated by 333 to 284 – a majority of 49 for the government. The Conservative MP John Penrose, a member of the influential European Reform Group in parliament, earlier said the amendment “simply legislates for something that will happen naturally anyway, while at the same time asking the government to reveal its negotiating hand”. Another amendment, which was not voted on, was tabled by prominent Labour backbenchers including Chris Leslie and Mary Creagh, asking for the publication of separate reports in different policy areas setting out the process and priorities for leaving the EU. Devolved administrations The main Labour amendment, tabled by Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour frontbench, required the government to commit to reaching a consensus with all the devolved administrations. No 10 has said this is what the prime minister is doing through regular meetings of the joint ministerial council with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This is likely to be voted on. That amendment was defeated by 333 votes to 276 – an even bigger government majority of 57. The SNP tabled a raft of amendments with more radical consequences, including introducing a veto for devolved administrations during trade negotiations. Labour and Plaid Cymru MPs, among others, have tabled amendments arguing for Wales to be guaranteed the same levels of EU funding once Britain leaves the EU. None were accepted for a vote by MPs. EU citizens These amendments aim to give EU citizens in the UK the right to remain, regardless of the outcome of Brexit negotiations. There are no votes on this until Wednesday. Corbyn’s amendment commits the government to guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals living in Britain when article 50 is triggered. Another amendment tabled by Labour’s Harriet Harman and backed by Lefroy would explicitly require the government to guarantee the right of EU citizens to say, even if talks with Brussels were to fail after the two-year deadline has expired. Tuesday Two categories of amendments will be debated, and any accepted will be voted on by MPs. They are: Parliamentary votes on a final deal or second referendum The publication of impact assessments of leaving the EU Parliamentary votes on a final deal Tory rebels, including Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan and Ken Clarke, want to avoid a “cliff edge” scenario in which the UK leaves the EU with no trade deal in place and ends up with World Trade Organisation rules. It is possible that Conservatives could end up supporting a frontbench Labour amendment, or one laid down by Leslie, which insists that parliamentarians should not simply have a vote on an agreed deal, but a meaningful vote on any future relationship with the EU. Leslie’s amendment says MPs and peers should vote on the proposed terms of any deal before they are agreed with the European commission or put to MEPs in the European parliament, in order to significantly influence the next stage of the process. The Lib Dems and some more stridently pro-remain Labour backbenchers have also tabled amendments calling for a full UK-wide referendum on the final terms of the Brexit deal, with the other option being to stay in the EU. Impact assessments Corbyn and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, have tabled amendments that would require the government to publish impact assessments, conducted since the Brexit vote, of any new proposed trading relationship with the EU, which would, among other details, show the likely impact of leaving the single market and customs union. Other MPs have tabled a number of amendments calling for impact assessments on a huge range of issues connected with leaving the EU, from equality to supply chains, and food safety to environmental protections. Wednesday Parliament will debate the final set of amendments on the theme of negotiation priorities, followed by the report stage of the bill, where we will know if any amendments make it through to the most crucial stage – the third reading. Negotiation priorities The Labour frontbench has tabled amendments to establish a number of key principles for the negotiation process, including protecting workers’ rights and securing full tariff-free access to the single market. Labour backbenchers including Catherine McKinnell, Mike Gapes and Alison McGovern have tabled one amendment that would require the government to designate representatives from English regions to consult them during the negotiations. It is considered unlikely that any amendments in this category will be accepted by the government or pass in their own right. What happens next? On Wednesday, a final debate will take place for about seven hours, ending with a vote on the bill, featuring any accepted amendments. If no Labour amendments are accepted, frontbenchers including Clive Lewis have indicated that they would be prepared to vote against triggering article 50. Even if Corbyn allowed MPs to abstain, which is unlikely, the bill is expected to pass comfortably. The legislation will then be passed to the House of Lords, although parliament is in recess between 9 February and 20 February. The Lords is expected to begin its scrutiny process with a two-day debate on the day parliament returns from recess. Further amendments could be agreed during the committee stage of the Lords, between 27 February and 1 March. Any amendments agreed by the Lords will need to be approved by the Commons, and the bill will pass back to MPs. This back and forth will continue until both houses agree, and the earliest this could effectively happen is 7 March. May’s self-imposed deadline for triggering article 50, agreed by parliament, is the end of March.', 'Top story: Amendments tumble in article 50 debate Hello, this is Warren Murray bringing you today’s Guardian morning briefing. The government has voted down several amendments to the bill authorising Theresa May to trigger Brexit negotiations. Devolved assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were denied a say in the final deal, and a requirement of regular reports by the prime minister to parliament was rejected along with a number of other Labour proposals in the House of Commons. Dozens of other amendments are still up for consideration – such as guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals already living in the UK. But May has warned MPs not to use parliamentary procedure to delay the bill’s progress, saying this would amount to obstructing the verdict of the June 2016 referendum. While upbeat projections about Brexit are hard to come by, the consultants PwC are touting the idea that the worst will be over by 2020 and Britain could become the fastest-growing economy in the G7 if it can nail down the right trade deals while using its flexible economy and relatively large working-age population to maximum advantage. * * * Trump’s ‘under-reported’ terror – Donald Trump has declared that the media he despises has let terror attacks go under-reported – an assertion that appears to be contradicted by another of his old enemies, the facts. The president, beleaguered by a string of legal challenges blocking his travel ban, has claimed that “dishonest” journalists are holding back from reporting on terrorism. The White House did what it could to back him up, releasing a not entirely coherent list of 70-odd instances of what Trump might have been talking about. No one was too surprised to find that many of them – the Bataclan in Paris, the Nice and Berlin attacks – received blanket coverage in the world’s press. * * * ‘Housing market is broken’ – The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, is to say that “the housing market in this country is broken” as the government pushes for councils to build thousands of new homes “in the places that people want to live”. The vision includes high-rise developments in the inner city where land is scarce. Home ownership is declining and the average house now costs eight times average earnings. * * * Horror of Syrian hangings – Up to 13,000 opponents of Bashar al-Assad were secretly hanged during the first five years of the country’s civil war, according to Amnesty International. Martin Chulov reports on the horror of Saydnaya prison, where thousands more people are believed to have died through torture and starvation before being dumped in mass graves. In “a conflict that has consistently broken new ground in depravity”, civilians were subjected to sham trials, hanged in groups of up to 50, then buried on military land, witnesses have told Amnesty. * * * Commons decency – We have an editorial praising John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, who has ruffled Conservative feathers by declaring that leader of a global superpower or not, Donald Trump is unfit to be afforded the honour of giving an address at Westminster when he takes up Theresa May’s invitation to visit Britain. Bercow has been accused by some of overstepping his authority and breaching the impartiality of his office.\\n* * * Spice back on menu – The ban on what we used to call “legal highs” may have driven them out of high street stores, but instead they have been added to the offering of illicit street dealers, a study warns. A wave of “head shops” that sold what are now known as “novel psychoactive substances” closed down in 2016 when the ban came into force – but wares like “Spice” have re-emerged in clear plastic bags sold by drug pushers.\\n* * * Eyes have it – The hassle of buying a train ticket could be over in the blink of an eye if rail companies decide to bring in retinal scanning. Using a phone with Bluetooth to pass through the turnstiles is already being trialled and now the Rail Delivery Group is looking at biometrics to speed things up.

It amounts to a list of objectives, many of which will not necessarily be easy to achieve. Sovereignty, great repeal bill and control of UK laws The paper says the British parliament has been sovereign throughout the UK’s EU membership, “but it has not always felt like that” – a striking comment. It says the government will bring forward a separate white paper on the great repeal bill, which was first announced by May in her Conservative party conference speech last year to remove the European Communities Act of 1972 from the UK statute book and convert the body of existing EU law into domestic law. The paper confirms that “wherever practical and appropriate” the same rules and laws will apply in the UK on the day after it leaves the EU as did before. It also confirms that the government intends to “take control of our own laws”, which will mean “bringing to an end the jurisdiction of the European court of justice in the UK” and establishing a new mechanism for resolving future disputes between the UK and the EU. The union and Ireland The paper says the government will “work with the devolved administrations on an approach to returning powers from the EU that works for the whole of the UK and reflects the interests of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales” but does not go into specifics. It also promises that no decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be taken away from them, and indeed that more decisions will be devolved (it does not say which). And it says it will pay particular attention to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and Gibraltar, all of which have unique relationships with the EU. On the island of Ireland and the common travel area with the UK, the paper notes the UK and Irish economies are “deeply integrated” and says the government will work to “develop and strengthen” those ties after Brexit. It says it aims to retain “as seamless and frictionless a border as possible” between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and wants Irish and UK citizens to be able to continue to move freely north-south and east-west, “while protecting the integrity of the UK’s immigration system”. Again, it does not say how. Immigration and reciprocal citizens’ rights On the rights of EU nationals living in the UK and vice versa, the white paper goes no further than May’s speech. It says securing their status is “one of this government’s early priorities for the forthcoming negotiations” and reiterates that “the UK remains ready to give people the certainty they want … at the earliest opportunity”. (The EU-27 have always seen this as part of article 50 negotiations). It says it is consulting with expatriate groups abroad and EU businesses and other groups “to ensure we understand their priorities”, and “recognises the priority placed on easy access to healthcare by UK nationals living in the EU” – a key concern of many, particularly pensioners. On controlling immigration, the paper offers no clarity. It says the government is “considering very carefully” the options open to it and working to “understand the impacts on the different sectors of the economy and the labour market”. Businesses and communities will be able to contribute their views, it says, and suggests – for the first time with regard to immigration – that “there may be a phased process of implementation”, to give companies and individuals time to plan and prepare. It says EU students can continue to come and study, in the short term at least, but says nothing about future access for EU workers. It also says workers’ rights under EU law will be preserved after Brexit. EU trade, single market, customs union and budget The white paper reiterates that the government aims to secure “the freest and most frictionless trade possible in goods and services” with the EU outside the single market and via “an ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement”. It also wants to be outside the customs union, so it can negotiate its own trade deals, but would like “a new customs agreement”, which should be theoretically possible thanks to new technology. Again, this does not go further than May’s speech. We are told once more that the UK will not seek to adopt an existing model used by other countries, but try to “take in elements” of the single market in certain areas – in other words, bespoke deals for important business sectors. From the EU perspective, all this is ambitious: it sounds suspiciously like cherry-picking. The paper plays up the financial services card, which the government plainly considers a strong one: the EU has a clear interest in “mutual cooperation arrangements”, it says, describing the City as Europe’s only global hub for money, trading and investment on which the EU will continue to rely. It confirms the UK will leave the Euratom treaty, the legal framework for nuclear power, but says a new relationship will be negotiated, and it says the UK’s future status with EU agencies regulating areas such as medicines, aviation, food safety and financial services will also be part of discussions. And there will be no more “vast contributions” to the EU budget, as May already said. Trade with other countries; research The paper repeats May’s pledge to make the UK a “champion of free trade” and says it will seek bilateral free trade agreements and participate in multilateral negotiations through the World Trade Organisation. It acknowledges Britain “cannot agree new trade deals until after we have left the EU” – a possible bone of contention with the EU27 – but says there is “much we can do to prepare and to achieve now while respecting our obligations as members”. It also says work is already under way on establishing Britain’s own schedules covering trade in goods and services at the WTO, aimed as far as possible at replicating those it currently has as an EU member. The paper also says Britain aims to “continue to collaborate with EU partners” on a key part of its new industrial strategy: science, research and technology. Many academics expect this to become considerably more difficult after Brexit. Security and crime cooperation As May has already said, the UK will seek to continue working with the EU “to preserve UK and European security and to fight terrorism and uphold justice across Europe”, the paper says. It says the government will aim to retain and develop existing cooperation in initiatives like Europol, the European arrest warrant, the Schengen information system, the new EU passenger name records, and the European criminal records information system. In terms of security and defence, it also promises to “remain committed to European security and add value to EU foreign and security policy” – an offer that may well prove valuable in the exit negotiations. Orderly exit The white paper says the government aims to deliver “a smooth, mutually beneficial exit” but says this will require “a coherent and coordinated approach on both sides”. Article 50 will be triggered no later than the end of March, it repeats. It acknowledges it is “in no one’s interests for there to be a cliff-edge for business or a threat to stability”, saying the government would like “to have reached an agreement about our future partnership” by the end of the article 50 process and repeating May’s suggestion of variable “phased processes of implementation” to give everyone time to plan and prepare for the new arrangements. The paper also reiterates the prime minister’s remarks that “no deal for the UK is better than a bad deal for the UK” – and suggests that, to mitigate against the impact of not getting the deal it wants from the EU, the government will prepare legislation “to ensure our economic and other functions van continue”. It does not say what the legislation will contain, or what future economic model the government might envisage.', 'Whitehall. A delegation of supermarket retailers.

Neatly, this is the same building where John F Kennedy declared in 1963: “Ich bin ein Berliner.” Now, I’m also a German Berliner! When I did the necessary German citizenship test in October, another British guy and I left the exam together. “Are you another Brexit victim?” he asked. Am I? I certainly thought I was, in the early hours of 24 June. I postal-voted remain, and felt cut off from a country I no longer understood. I felt insecure about my future as a non-EU citizen in Germany. So, victim? Actually, not really. I’ve realised that by becoming German, Brexit has a silver lining. This is how it happened. 25 July 2016 I arrive early at the citizenship section of the town hall and wait for Frau Mittag (“Mrs Midday”), responsible for surnames starting with “W”. I’ve lived in Germany, with a few breaks, since 1992. My wife and kids are German. Yet I have always been rather worried about how becoming German would change me, so never thought seriously about doing it, until 24 June. I was comfortable on the outside of German society, looking in. Frau Mittag is friendly, mid-50s. We chat, she notices I speak German and says she won’t insist on an official language test. A good start. She gives me the application forms, the long list of necessary documents, and tells me citizenship costs €255. Not cheap. I ask if many British people are applying post-Brexit? “Yes, there’s been quite a wave,” she says. And she warns: “Without it (after Brexit), you’ll have to apply for a residency permit, which may not be easy.” A useful incentive! “And you can keep your British passport.” “That’s important to me,” I say, as if she is already an old friend. 23 August Back at the town hall and I am an hour too early for my appointment. Time for a coffee in the wood-panelled basement canteen and a moment to reflect: how German am I? More than I realise. I use my crumpled German driving licence – with a picture from 1992 – as my ID. I’m comfortable with the national rituals – celebrating Christmas on 24 December, holidaying on Baltic sea islands and ski slopes in Bavaria. During the World Cup, I try to cheer for England but cheering for Germany comes more naturally (and not just because they win more). Thinking of a map of the country, I realise I’ve visited all 16 federal states. I feel at home here. I hand over my dozen documents to Frau Mittag – payslips, my wife’s payslips, birth certificate, kids’ birth certificates, mortgage arrangements. Now the unofficial language test. She gives me a blank piece of paper. “Just write a few sentences about your summer vacation.” I do so. It feels like the first day back at school. She reviews it briefly and seems satisfied. 28 August\\nI sit down at home with an extra document Frau Mittag gave me – my commitment to the German constitution. Serious stuff; the first sentence says the country’s “free, democratic basic order is the basis for the peaceful co-existence of people in Germany”. It lists human rights, sovereignty of the people and equality between men and women as core values. I agree with them but it feels like a big step to commit in a formal way. I realise that I avoided citizenship partly to avoid grappling with such pledges. I think it’s a British thing. I sign anyway. 23 September News comes that Germany’s Greens are standing up for us Brits! They propose a law to speed up citizenship applications for the 107,000 Brits in Germany. I’m realising Brexit has pushed me to make a decision I would have felt comfortable with years ago. Signing up to the constitution feels OK, especially in these difficult times. This summer has seen minor terrorist attacks in Germany (another major attack happened at a Christmas market not far from my home on 19 December). It’s a time when politicians are urging us to beat the terrorists by holding on to democratic values. With citizenship I can also vote in national elections, which feels very grown up. Do I feel less British by also being German? Yes, if it’s the new “Brexit means Brexit” Britain; no if it’s the Britain deep in my soul – my family, my upbringing, my culture. 3 October My citizenship test is looming. Samples of the multiple choice questions are passed around the breakfast table. Even my 13-year-old daughter, usually too cool for such things, says the questions are “really simple”. German bureaucracy helps: all the right answers to the possible 300 questions are on an official website. 5 October Test day. Butterflies in my stomach. Throwback to school: small tables in rows, turn over your papers, you may begin. First of 33 questions: when did Hitler come to power? 1933? 1936? Mild moment of panic. Old habits kick in. Leave it, return to it later. I plough on. The rest are easier (what criminal punishments are allowed in Germany? Yes to fines and prison, no to torture. Who has the responsibility to bring up kids in Germany? Right answer: parents!) I decide for Hitler it’s 1933, get up and leave. 9 November My test results arrive: 100% correct! My best exam score ever. 5 December Post from Frau Mittag. She wants details of my wife’s parents, and her grandparents, to prove she is really German. One question asks: did her grandad fight in Hitler’s Wehrmacht army? He did, but would she be less German if he didn’t? Another town hall trip to drop off the paperwork. 5 January 2017 Citizenship day! I’ve heard I shouldn’t expect a ceremony, no mayoral handshakes. But it still feels special, especially with my wife accompanying me. Frau Mittag asks me to read a pledge of allegiance to Germany (sitting down, no hand on heart – what a disappointment). She hands over the certificate and declares me now a “citizen of Germany”. My wife and I celebrate in a nearby cafe. In this moment, Brexit feels a long time ago. And Germany feels a bit more like home. Anyone for a Beck’s?', 'A hard Brexit with deep cuts to immigration would force Britons into longer working lives in order to maintain a sustainable ratio of workers and pensioners, according to modelling conducted for the Guardian. Rises in the state pension age are anticipated as a result of increased life expectancy and large numbers of baby boomers retiring. But further delays to pension payments will be necessary if current levels of immigration, which sustain the country’s old age dependency ratio, are not maintained, the Oxford University work indicates.\\nProf Sarah Harper, the director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing and chair of the UK government’s foresight review on ageing societies, said: “The message from Brexit is if you don’t want immigrants, you’re going to have to work longer. That’s how the sums work.” In the modelling, Harper’s team predicted that if migration were stopped, it would have a serious impact on workers, necessitating “far longer working lives”. “Since the middle of the 20th century, the UK, like many other advanced economies, has employed migrant labour to reduce the ratio between older dependants and workers, which has arisen as child-bearing rates have fallen and people have lived longer,” said Harper, who also serves on the government’s science and technology council. “However, if all migration into the UK was to be halted, then over the next five years, those coming up to retirement would have to work about one-and-a-half years longer just in order to maintain current output [of GDP]. Indeed, any significant reduction in labour immigration would wipe out the projected benefits to GDP of small delays in retirement, or require far longer working lives.” The modelling was conducted for the Guardian’s new two-month investigation into the momentous social change that Britain’s ageing population will bring. Life expectancy is growing by five hours a day. In 2014, the average age in the UK exceeded 40 for the first time. Almost a third of people born today can expect to live to 100. The implications for work, care, leisure, housing, business, taxation, family and relationships are formidable. Harper also warned that if limits to immigration were introduced, the UK’s fertility rate, which is close to replacement level (about two births a woman), would drop, as women living in Britain who were born outside the UK have much higher birthrates than those born in the UK. “If, because of Brexit, we limit migration, we will start ageing at the same rate as Greece, Italy and Spain,” said Harper. These countries are facing serious economic and social problems linked to declining populations caused by low birthrates - 1.3 births per woman in Greece, 1.32 in Spain and 1.37 in Italy, compared with 1.81 in the UK. While Harper’s modelling was based on zero net migration, even reducing the number of people allowed into the country to a “low migration scenario” would have a significant effect on the state pension age. John Cridland, the former CBI director who is reviewing the state pension age, told a recent conference run by the International Longevity Centre UK that the affordability of the state pension into the future had been made uncertain by “the Brexit factor”.\\nPointing to a chart in his interim report published last October, which showed different projections of the old age dependency ratio into the future, Cridland said: “The reason this is a very unpredictable chart is migration – the Brexit factor.” Even without changes to immigration, the number of dependants for every working adult is starting to rise in the UK. As a result, according to a report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the state pension age could be forced up to 70 by the late 2030s. The foundation estimates that the size of the dependent population (broadly speaking, children and pensioners) will start to rise for the first time in decades. The report says there are seven dependants for every 10 people of working age at the moment, but this will increase to eight in the 2020s and nine by 2050. “This decade marks the turning point in a transition to an ageing population in which the population of people aged 65+ is set to grow faster than that of working age,” said David Willetts, the executive chair of the Resolution Foundation. “While the UK population has steadily risen over the past 50 years, it is the balance within society between the young (aged under 20), old (aged 65 and over) and those of working age (age 20 to 64) – on whom the remainder are largely dependent – which is set to change most dramatically. “For individuals, in simple terms, living longer will require an overall higher level of lifetime income to maintain a certain standard of living. With the large baby boomer cohort entering retirement, the concern is that younger generations face a need to balance achieving a higher lifetime income with the requirement to direct additional resources to support an ageing population.” Effects of Brexit Carl Emmerson, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned that an economic downturn caused by Brexit could mean extending older people’s working lives. “If the government is struggling with its budget because of Brexit, it’s maybe more likely to bring in reforms that encourage people to work for longer,” he said. “If you have a ratio of retired people to working age that is increasing, in the long run you’ve got to think of ways of adapting: spending less when you’re working, having less when you retire, or working longer. “It’s possible to adjust that ratio by having more people come in. If they stay just until they retire, then it’s great for the government. Also, immigrants often turn up after having been born and been educated – that’s often expensive too, the government tends to spend money on people before they enter the labour market and after they retire.”\\nHarper said as well as potentially delaying the age at which people were able to stop working, reductions in immigration could harm older people by depleting the numbers of social care workers in the country – one in 20 of whom are migrants from the European Economic Area – who do the bulk of caring for elderly people in care homes. This would hit London hardest, where almost 11% of the social care workforce is made up of EEA migrants without British citizenship. “We’re becoming older, we’re becoming frailer, we’re having fewer children and those children, particularly women, are not really working at home and are therefore not able to care for frail elderly relatives. So we need migrant healthcare workers because they’re the ones who are willing to do the work,” she said. “When it comes to care we have a real problem: who is going to care for our older population if we’re not going to encourage lower-skilled people [to migrate]?”', 'PM Free movement is the stumbling block. I have publicly said that the 27 will sign up to a deal with us. But will they? Foreign secretary Hope so. PM Hope so? What about Slovakia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary?

PM I think you’re full of Brexit.', 'Confidence among British business executives has stabilised after hitting a four-year low in September, but firms still regard economic uncertainty as the biggest threat after the Brexit vote. The latest Business in Britain report from Lloyds Banking Group, which is published twice a year, shows the business confidence index rose to 14% from 12% in September. It is an average of firms’ expected sales, orders and profits over the next six months. They are net balances of those reporting an increase minus those reporting a decline. The biggest threat cited by companies in the next six months was economic uncertainty (26%), followed by weaker UK demand (17%).\\nOn a more positive note, there has been a jump in businesses expecting to export to Asia, bolstered by the weaker pound. The net balance of firms anticipating stronger export sales in the next six months rose for all regions, from the US/Canada, the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Asia Pacific to Europe. Overall, export expectations improved by six points to 26% from September. This was driven by a big increase in the net balance of companies expecting stronger exports to Asia Pacific and the Middle East, which went up by 11 and 7 points respectively. Businesses said the exchange rate was the most favourable for exports since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009. The pound hit 31-year lows in October and is down 17% against the dollar and 10% against the euro since the EU referendum. Manufacturing and the hospitality and leisure industries in particular have benefitted from the slide in sterling. Confidence among manufacturers doubled to 28%, and jumped to 28% from 16% among hotels, restaurants and other leisure businesses, as the weaker pound has led to a mini tourism boom. In all other sectors, confidence has fallen.\\nOverall business confidence is well below the long-term average, but remains well above the lows seen during the last financial crisis, supported by demand from the UK and abroad. Tim Hinton, managing director of mid-markets and SME banking at Lloyds, said: “The banking sector also has a much stronger capital position to withstand any shocks than in 2008-09 which should give businesses more confidence that their growth ambitions can be supported in the year ahead. “We should expect more twists and turns in 2017 but in the meantime business owners are resilient and continuing to do what they do best – getting on with growing their businesses while keeping an eye on the external risks.” The weaker pound is also pushing up firms’ prices. The net balance of businesses expecting to raise their prices in the next six months climbed to 20% from 13%. Among importing firms, the measure rose to 28% from 20%, hitting the highest level since 2013.\\nCompanies remain cautious about hiring and investing. The net balances of firms expecting to raise their investment and staffing levels in the next six months remained low at 1% and 2% respectively. Business confidence was highest in the north-east (up 1 point to 22%), followed by Scotland (up 15 points to 21%), the east of England (up 1 point to 20%) and the south west (up 13 points to 17%). Confidence fell sharply in Wales (down 10 points to 15%) and Yorkshire and the Humber (down 15 points to 17%), but remained above the national average. The weakest confidence levels were recorded in the West Midlands (down 16 points to 1%), London (up 5 points to 9%) and the East Midlands (down 2 points to 12%). The report collects the views of more than 1,500 UK companies, mostly small to medium-sized businesses.', 'Cabinet secretary Apart from your Great Repeal Bill, you still have to say what “Brexit means Brexit” actually means.

First we have to hire lots of people, just to process the CVs of the people we need to hire. PM God! Then what? Cabinet secretary We either get people from KPMG at very high cost. Or place an advert: “Multi-lingual, world-class authority on global trade and international law required.” PM Why hasn’t Corbyn asked me about Brexit at PMQs? Could he be on my side? Cabinet secretary Maybe. You’ve been accused of pretending to support Remain during the referendum while soft on an emergency brake for immigration. PM Rubbish! I split up 33,000 immigrant families and refused to put any time limit on the detention of immigration detainees. I said I’d allow refugees only a temporary stay in Britain. I withdrew British support for naval search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean. My record on immigration is unblemished and clear. Cabinet secretary Corbyn says he won’t put any curbs on immigration. PM None of us do things just because we say so. Cabinet secretary He might. Knowing him. PM Good thing he can’t then. When this bill goes through parliament we’ll be in a much better place. Cabinet secretary What if the Lords hold it up? PM They won’t want to provoke a constitutional crisis. Cabinet secretary Aren’t we already in one? PM Oh yes. Jonathan Lynn is the co-creator of Yes Minister. @mrjonathanlynn', 'Overheard in the men’s loo outside the cabinet room. Business minister Why does the PM keep insisting that there will be no backsliding? I thought she was for remain. Brexit minister It’s because she believes in democracy. The people have spoken. Business minister Why can’t they speak again?\\nBrexit minister We can’t challenge the result of a vote just because we don’t like it. That’s obviously undemocratic. Business minister Why is it undemocratic to give the public a chance to change their minds? That’s what happens every time we have an election. Every five years, in fact. Brexit minister We don’t hold elections on constitutional issues. That’s not the British tradition. Once we’re in power we say: “We have a mandate,” and we just go ahead and change the constitution if we feel like it. Like Blair did. Lords reform. Or devolution. But this was a referendum on a specific issue. This is different. We have to stick to it. Business minister We said it wasn’t binding. Only advisory. Brexit minister We said that when we thought we would lose. Now we’ve won, it’s binding. Business minister A referendum isn’t even in our constitution. Parliament is supposed to be sovereign. I thought that’s why we wanted to leave Europe. So we don’t lose our sovereignty. Brexit minister Right. We’re getting our sovereignty back. So, we can’t have an election about it later, the people might change their minds. Then where would we be? Chaos. Business minister There’s no chaos now? Brexit minister If we lost a second referendum and stayed in the EU, we would lose our sovereignty all over again. Business minister How could we lose our sovereignty if our sovereignty depends on a sovereign parliament and the sovereign parliament votes to remain? Brexit minister You’re confusing things. Business minister That’s what we’ve always called democracy. Till now. Brexit minister That’s a different kind of democracy. That’s a parliamentary democracy. We’ve moved on from that. We’re cutting out the middle man. Now, it’s just the people and us. Business minister We should be asking parliament if we can trigger article 50. Brexit minister We can’t put triggering article 50 to parliament because parliament might refuse until they know the terms we’ve negotiated. And the lawyers say that triggering article 50 is the royal prerogative, nothing to do with parliament. Business minister That sounds really democratic. Brexit minister I just don’t understand your problem. Business minister My problem is that I don’t think the people understood what they were voting for. Brexit minister I agree – we handled that really well, don’t you think? Jonathan Lynn is the co-creator of Yes Minister. @mrjonathanlynn', 'A historic ruling by the supreme court forced Theresa May to give parliament a vote on Brexit, but rebellious MPs from her own party want more of a say over plans to quit the single market and customs union. Judges from the highest court in the land decided by eight to three that MPs must approve a decision as significant as leaving the EU, prompting Brexit secretary David Davis to say that tightly drafted legislation would be published within days. But the court added it was not for judges to specify what form an act of parliament to trigger the article 50 exit clause would take. Delivering his judgment, Lord Neuberger, the president of the supreme court, said: “A notice under article 50(2) could no doubt be very short indeed, but that would not undermine its momentous significance.” The supreme court also ruled that there was no need for the government to wait for consent from the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\\nGina Miller, who first brought the case against the government, insisted that her challenge was not about trying to stop Britain’s EU exit. “There is no doubt that Brexit is the most divisive issue of a generation. But this case was about the legal process, not politics. Today’s decision has created legal certainty, based on our democratic process and provides the legal foundation for the government to trigger article 50,” she said. A few hours after the ruling, Davis told MPs that the legal decision from Britain’s most senior judges would not block or delay Brexit. “This House voted by six to one to put the decision in the hands of voters, and that bill passed the other place unopposed,” the Brexit secretary told the House of Commons, whose legislation could be laid down as early as Thursday. “So there can be no going back. The point of no return was passed on 23 June last year,” he added, warning MPs and peers not to use the process to try to “thwart the will of the people”. Davis said the government would produce “the most straightforward bill possible”, which would deal only with the narrow question of triggering article 50 by the end of March deadline. Former cabinet minister and Brexit supporter, Iain Duncan Smith, urged him to make the bill and its passage through parliament “short ... simple ... and swift”. Most of the MPs and peers who backed remain are unlikely to use the legislation as a means of trying to block article 50 itself. But Davis and May will have to fight off several attempted amendments, including from MPs in their own party who want more of a say over specific decision to leave the single market and customs union. Gavin Williamson, the Tory chief whip, held urgent meetings with potential rebels after seven Conservative MPs stood up in the Commons to urge May to publish her Brexit plan as an official white paper that could then be formally discussed in parliament.\\nTory MP Ben Howlett told the Guardian that he wanted the government to take that step so that his constituents could “have their views heard”. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, agreed: “What we haven’t yet debated is that relationship between single market, freedom of movement and the customs union.” Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, also pressed his government for action. “I think a white paper is immensely desirable and in my view is helpful to government if it can be available as they go through the article 50 process,” he said, arguing that it would simply formalise the government strategy in a “reasoned fashion”. Tory backbencher Anna Soubry pressed Davis on the issue, asking: “What has my honourable friend got to lose with a debate on a white paper?” The MPs do not think that May’s Lancaster House speech is adequate as a Brexit plan, but stress that a white paper would simply trigger a formal discussion and not lead to votes that could impact on Brexit. Davis, who had described May’s speech on Brexit last week as “the clearest exposition of a negotiating strategy I have seen in modern times”, said the prime minister’s address was sufficient explanation.\\n“I’m afraid it’s very difficult to see how you can leave the European Union and still stay inside the single market, with all the commitments that go with that,” said Davis. Sources insisted that MPs had been given lots of time to debate issues linked to Brexit, but did not rule out the possibility of a concession on this issue. One admitted the government was “keen to accommodate” the desire of MPs to have debates – and ministers will also not want to lose a vote on an amendment. They know that the Conservative MPs speaking publicly were among 15 or 20 who might line up alongside members of the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, and the Scottish National party over the issue. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, admitted that while Labour does not want to frustrate the will of the people it will “seek to ensure the government publish a proper plan – ideally a white paper”. The frontbencher knows his party will face difficulties through the process with MPs divided across some of the most passionately leave and remain constituencies. About 60 Labour MPs may be prepared to defy a party order to vote in favour of triggering article 50, with frontbenchers expected to resign if a three-line whip is enforced.\\nSeveral shadow ministers whose constituencies are in areas which are strongly pro-remain have publicly said they would also vote against when a bill is introduced. Catherine West, the shadow foreign minister who was elected MP for Hornsey and Wood Green in 2015, said her constituency voted by 81.5% in favour of remain. “The best way I can represent my constituents, and indeed protect our national interest, is to vote against invoking article 50.” Concerns with May’s plan have also been raised by shadow cabinet members Diane Abbott and Clive Lewis. However, it is unclear whether defying the whip would result in MPs losing frontbench positions given that Jeremy Corbyn is sympathetic to the difficulties faced within constituencies.\\nStarmer will hope to please remain-supporting MPs by laying down a limited number of targeted amendments to show clear division with the Tories. “Triggering article 50 is just the start, not the end, of the Brexit process, so is important we ensure there is proper grip and accountability throughout the negotiations,” he told the Guardian. Labour and other parties, including the Greens, are frustrated by May’s suggestion that a vote for MPs and votes on the final agreement would be largely insignificant, because the alternative would be crashing out of the EU without a deal. Instead, they want the prime minister to offer parliament enough time to be able to go back and renegotiate the deal if it is rejected. The Lib Dems want the government to go further and to offer a referendum on the final deal, and will vote against article 50 if they are not backed on that point. The SNP-led Scottish government was disappointed at the judges’ ruling that May did not need permission from the devolved administrations to trigger article 50. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the decision meant Westminster assurances that Scotland was an equal partner in the union were worthless, and again raised the prospect of a snap independence referendum. She said her government would table its own legislative consent motion in Holyrood, regardless of the supreme court ruling. Sources said the government can label the Brexit bill as urgent legislation and speed it through the House of Commons. One option in the Lords is to reduce the time between each stage of the bill. Tuesday’s supreme court judgment does not, however, mark an end to the legal challenges the government will face over Brexit. A case brought by two sets of claimants is expected at the high court in London in the coming days over the question of whether the UK remains inside the European Economic Area and the single market after it has left the EU.', 'The Foreign Secretary welcomes the Polish ambassador. Foreign secretary Ah, please come in. Do sit down. I’ve invited you here to discuss these recent attacks on Polish property. And Polish citizens too. We want you to know that the British government takes racism and xenophobia extremely seriously. Ambassador You’re in favour of it, right? Foreign secretary Of course not! Well, I mean, some of my cabinet colleagues, maybe … Ambassador But you, personally, tried to discredit President Obama by suggesting he’s not fully American. Part-Kenyan, you said. Foreign secretary That was just politics. He shouldn’t have come over here and told the British they’d be screwed if they voted Leave. Ambassador But he was right. Foreign secretary That’s completely beside the point. Ambassador And you said the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies. Foreign secretary (Incredulous) Are you saying that’s racism? Ambassador Yes. Plus that stuff about watermelon smiles. Foreign secretary That’s not racism. Ambassador Then why did you apologise? Foreign secretary Political correctness. No choice. Ambassador You know, you remind me a little of Donald Trump. Foreign secretary (Appalled) Me? Ambassador You and your colleagues led a campaign to build a wall to keep everybody else out. Look what it’s led to: our citizens being murdered in the streets by British xenophobes, the Polish Cultural Centre vandalised … hate crimes are up 58% in Britain since your referendum. Foreign secretary I know. Shocking. But if the Poles weren’t here, our yobbos couldn’t beat them up. That’s the reason we want to limit the immigration. For their own protection.

Are you going to boot them out? Foreign secretary Absolutely not. The home secretary’s been very clear about that. So has the prime minister. They can stay here and take their chances. Jonathan Lynn is the co-creator of Yes Minister. @mrjonathanlynn', 'George Osborne has warned Theresa May against pursuing a “hard Brexit” that would see the UK drifting away from cooperation with the rest of Europe. The former chancellor made the remarks at a speech in Chicago, in a sign that he intends to continue to play a role in the political debate about leaving the EU, despite departing the government at the same time as David Cameron. Osborne, who campaigned strongly to remain, argued that it was unwise for politicians to claim the UK had a stronger hand in negotiations than the EU. “I find some of the take-it-or-leave-it bravado we hear from those who assume Europe has no option but to give us everything we want more than a little naive,” he told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “We need to be realistic that this is a two-way relationship – that Britain cannot expect to maintain all the benefits that came from EU membership without incurring any of the costs or the obligations.” He urged May’s government to “resist the false logic that leads from exiting the EU to exiting all forms of European cooperation – and that values the dangerous purity of splendid isolation over the practical necessity of cooperation in the real world”. “Brexit won a majority. Hard Brexit did not,” Osborne said.\\nThe former chancellor also predicted that there would be no serious progress in negotiations with the EU until after the French and German elections next year. “It is highly unlikely that the rest of Europe will be in any position to conduct serious negotiations until the autumn of next year. “My experience of six years of European negotiations is that nothing serious happens until the French and, especially, the German governments take a view – and both countries will be preoccupied with their own domestic elections for much of next year.” The Tory MP Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general and leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, said: “George Osborne is absolutely right that a hard Brexit has no mandate and would be no answer to the problems Britain faces. “In fact, it would put jobs and livelihoods at risk by erecting new barriers to trade with Europe. As he said, being close to Europe despite the Brexit vote is vital for Britain’s future. “Our economic future depends on membership of the single market, while cooperation with Europe on security is crucial in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.” It was Osborne’s first major speech since he lost his job when May took over from Cameron as prime minister in July. Since then, she has set about unravelling key aspects of Osborne’s economic policy and overturning central tenets of Cameron’s premiership, such as his opposition to bringing back grammar schools. Osborne indicated in a BBC Radio 4 interview last week that he would stay on the political scene but he gave only a lukewarm endorsement of May’s premiership. May is facing competing pressures when it comes to carrying out negotiations with the EU. She has said she wants a bespoke deal for Britain that preserves free trade at the same time as curbing free movement for EU citizens to come to Britain. Some of the most hardline Eurosceptics would like her to be prepared to walk away from the single market and close trade cooperation if the EU does not concede to strict controls on immigration.', 'Four days is just a blink of an eye for lawyers used to charging by the minute. Left to their own devices, everyone at the supreme court would have been much happier dragging things out for a couple of years – finally reaching a decision on whether the government had the constitutional right to trigger Brexit long after Britain had left the EU. But needs must and there was a noticeable sense of disquiet – not to mention haste – as the proceedings entered their final day. After some discussion about the semantic differences between “with regard to” and “relating to” and the epistemology of “imposing a clamp on a conduit pipe”, Richard Gordon, the barrister representing the Welsh assembly, declared that the whole case wasn’t nearly as complicated as everyone had been making out. “A child of six could respect this point,” he said. “Well put,” replied Lord Neuberger. Obviously. Any fool must have realised that Kung Fu Panda 2 was a metaphor for constitutional law. “I’ve just pulled up the constitution of Trinidad and Tobago which we’re all very familiar with,” announced Lady Hale, apropos of not very much. Perhaps she was working on a different case. Gordon wisely ignored her. Of the 2015 Referendum Act he said: “It’s a statute that had died. It has fulfilled its purpose. You can’t revive a corpse by tearing up the death certificate.” Not for the first time article 50 was in danger of turning into a Monty Python sketch. Next up was the impressive Helen Mountfield, acting for the People’s Challenge, who was heard out in almost silence. Not one of the 11 judges even raised an eyebrow when she compared the government’s case to the search for the Loch Ness monster. Either they were spellbound by her command of the law or were worried about getting to lunch in time. A bit of both probably. After a quick post-prandial quibble with Patrick Green, speaking on behalf of the expats, over whether a Trojan Horse could be found in section five or section six of the 2008 EU act, Lord Keen, the government’s Scottish QC, was allowed to make a surprise guest appearance for the appellants. “If we are right or if we are wrong about the 1972 European Communities Act ...” he began. He hesitated, either for effect or because he had already lost his train of thought, before saying that he was right either way. Brilliant. He could be right, he could be wrong, but he would still basically be right. Last up was James Eadie, the QC with the short straw of restating the government’s case that had already been laughed out of the divisional courts. Eadie looked up at the clock with the eye of a condemned man. An hour. A whole hour to try to make the same points he had never really believed in when he’d opened the case on the previous Monday. In another world, he’d have just stood up and said: “I rest my case,” and dived for the exit. But now he had the eyes of the attorney general boring into his back. “We do not assert a power to repeal the Dangerous Dogs Act,” he gurned, trying to get things under way with a gag. Big mistake. Lord Pannick might have the easy charm to get away with making jokes about the Dangerous Dogs Act, but Eadie doesn’t. He’s just too awkward and within seconds he had several of the judges biting at his heels. What did he mean by that? Would he rather there was a Dangerous Dog Directive? Eadie turned puce and – presumably accidentally – implied that the Dangerous Dogs Act was a a far more important piece of legislation than the 1972 European Communities Act. With that a bad afternoon began to turn worse and Eadie was left to the defence of last resort. Throw up as many distractions as possible in the hope that the judges wouldn’t quite remember what the case was actually about. It didn’t appear to be working as Lord Mance appeared to have already heard enough and was demob happy. Speaking of the 1972 accession, he said: “Withdrawal was the last thing in your mind when you were getting married.” “Speak for yourself,” Lord Neuberger chipped in. All of which was getting Eadie precisely nowhere and he soon found himself disagreeing with Lord Sumption on the issue of whether Britain had gone to war with Germany in 1939. That really might have been the only bit of the entire case a six year old could have followed. “You’re guessing,” teased Lord Carnwath, as Eadie disappeared up another cul-de-sac. On another point proposed by Carnwath, Eadie said: “If it helps us, it helps us.” Desperate. With a final throw of the dice, Eadie made a last-ditch reference to the Brexit vote in the Commons the previous day, implying that everything was tickety-boo. Sumption swatted him away. “If the resolution had been enough for your purposes, then there would have been no need for this appeal.” The clock moved to just past four. Time up. Eadie’s existential nightmare was complete.', '', 'Donald Trump may be assembling the world’s richest government but he remains a few Boris Johnsons short of possessing the most arrogant and privileged one. Such a title surely belongs to the Tory government currently headed by Theresa May but which was begat by David Cameron. The real difference between Trump’s cabinet and May’s is that many of his high office holders have at least earned their fortunes. The UK Tory party, on the other hand, is the natural home of unearned wealth and privilege. It has always been a curious anomaly of the UK Tories that they preach the virtues of honest and hard graft but in practice will always promote the interests of those at the top of society who rarely work and who will do anything to avoid contributing to the upkeep of the country that allows them to wallow in this lifestyle. Another Tory anomaly is that while extolling the virtues of the free market and unfettered competition in all other areas, where their writ runs they encourage unfair advantage. They would rather award an important job to a buffoon who was considered the “right sort” than hand it to a competent person who, alas, attended the wrong school. Underpinning everything that they do at home and abroad is the need to ensure that power is exercised by as small and exclusive a group as possible. The lord alone knows how many military disasters (including many that have been concealed from us) have been the result of an inbred officer class that included many who were given the safe haven of a regiment to stop them creating chaos at home. How many billions of pounds in government cock-ups could have been saved if the higher echelons of the civil service were confined only to the UK’s brightest and best rather than a private members club for the scions of a small group of families who have been running the show since Agincourt? How many miscarriages of justice have occurred because we allow justice to be dispensed by a gratuitously and grotesquely unrepresentative temple of law lords? I did have a laugh last month at the faux outrage of people who were shocked that our top judges were being openly and savagely criticised over their Brexit verdict last month. Those gilded few who have ownership of the highest courts in the land are selected from a tiny tributary of society who attended the most exclusive and expensive schools before taking a place at Oxford or Cambridge that had been waiting for them since before they were born. Many of them would have struggled had they not had the benefit of a lopsided playing field. Why should we assume that all their verdicts are safe and that they dispense justice equitably when they are drawn from such a small pool? The arrogance of the Tories in government rests upon this pattern of privilege and entitlement that has remained more or less intact since Magna Carta. All around this power structure is the thrum of thousands of common people who subjugate their personal dignity and sense of self in the delusion that, one day, they may be beckoned in. They are to be found in some national newspapers and in the high command of the BBC. Many of them have insinuated themselves into the parliamentary Labour party. They are disdained by genuine aristocrats but nevertheless retained and indulged as useful idiots.\\nIt is why David Davis and Boris Johnson can stravaig around Europe insulting EU heads of state and demanding that they bow to their half-baked demands knowing full well that the ridiculousness of their position will never be properly examined at home. Almost every senior EU official, foreign minister and premier is united in their post-Brexit message to Britain: you can’t get access to the single market if you don’t allow free movement of our peoples and if you believe otherwise then you are a fool who is misleading your own people. Theresa May now appears to have grasped that the EU is not for budging, which is why this devout Christian is prepared to use millions of EU citizens resident in the UK as human shields in her negotiations with Europe. In Ms May’s church, they probably skipped over the feeding of the 5,000 lest any vulnerable person misinterpret it as a justification for socialism. In Scotland, you wonder when the nation will finally have had its fill of the sound of Tories just saying “No!” On Thursday, we witnessed another one, Phillip Hammond, making a rare visit north to Edinburgh to tell the Scottish government that not only would a separate Brexit deal for Scotland not happen but that the SNP were clutching at straws for asking for one. Effectively, he was telling Scotland: “Not only will your aspirations not be represented by the UK government but you don’t even have the right to ask in the first place.” This is from the man who tried to deflect criticism of the banks’ role in the 2008 credit crisis. “They had to lend to someone,” said Hammond, who has an estimated personal wealth of more than £10m. The same dismissive and sneering attitude was evident less than three years ago when another chancellor, George Osborne, told the Scottish people that they couldn’t use sterling if they dared to vote for independence. This was despite the fact that the pound belonged to Scotland as much as it did to the rest of the UK; that Scottish business taxes, oil and gas had contributed to the wealth of the UK and the traditional purchasing power of sterling. “You don’t even have the right to discuss this with us,” Osborne had effectively said. Like Osborne and Cameron and Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown, Hammond had used membership of the EU as one of several bribes offered in exchange for a No vote in the independence referendum. “Tough luck, suckers,” he is now effectively saying. “Now keep your mouths shut and let us do all the talking.”', 'Austerity (n) The price you have to pay for the mistakes that others, typically politicians and bankers, have made and aren’t going to pay for themselves. A catch-all term that includes being completely broke even if you’ve got a job (see Hardworking families) and hanging out at food banks if you’re out of work (see Scroungers). Blairite (n) Originally used to describe anyone who was a supporter of Tony Blair and to distinguish them from the Brownites who were followers of Gordon Brown. Now typically used in conjunction with “scum”, as in “Blairite scum”, to anyone in the Labour party who is not an enthusiastic supporter of Jeremy Corbyn (see Corbynista). Bourgeois metropolitan elite (ph) A description of anyone who lives inside the M25 and voted for Britain to stay in the EU. Brain fade (n) A term first coined by former Green party leader Natalie Bennett to describe the moment when a politician reveals him/herself to be a complete idiot live on TV or radio. As in “Can you tell me how your party intends to fund your housing policies, please Natalie?” “Er, no ... I haven’t a clue, I’m having a brain fade.” The brain fade’s saving grace is that it does at least reveal the politician to be fundamentally honest. If naive. When asked a question to which they don’t know the answer, more experienced politicians merely answer a different question to which they do have an answer. Brexit means Brexit (ph) A saying originally invented by the Remain campaign to frighten people into voting to stay in the EU. Once that failed it came to mean “Get off my back. I haven’t a clue what Brexit means right now and I will get back to you once I’ve cobbled together something that appears to be vaguely politically feasible.” Not even those who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU have any idea what Brexit means. Other than Brexit, of course. Throughout the referendum campaign, those who wanted Britain to leave the EU always said that it was up to the government, which was campaigning to stay in the EU, to tell them what Brexit would look like. Go figure.\\nBrick truthers (n) Those who were standing on a grassy knoll opposite Angela Eagle’s constituency office and know for certain that she was lying when she said a brick was thrown through her window because it definitely only went through a communal window and they will throw a brick through anyone’s window who says anything different. Chicken coup (ph) Term applied to describe those Labour MPs who would like to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as leader but know they have no chance of doing so and therefore spend most of their time briefing against him behind his back in the hope that he will resign. Corbynista (n) A neologism first coined in 2015 that now comes in two distinct usages. A member of the Labour party who has seen the true path of socialism and will follow Jeremy Corbyn even unto a defeat at the 2020 general election because it is far better to have 75 of the right kind of MPs than 326 who might be able to form a government (cf Blairite). A member of the Labour party who is completely deluded and will follow Jeremy Corbyn even unto a defeat at the 2020 general election because it is far better to have 75 of the right kind of MPs than 326 who might be able to form a government (cf Blairite).\\nDead cat strategy (ph) A key strategy in winning an election that you think you might be about to lose. Most recently deployed in the 2015 general election by Lynton Crosby, the Australian in charge of the Conservative election campaign. With Labour beginning to make headway with its focus on tax loopholes, Michael Fallon was sent out to make a gratuitous ad hominem attack on Ed Miliband. Within minutes everyone had forgotten about tax loopholes and was talking about Fallon. Doing the right thing (ph) How governments choose to describe policies they know are going to make most people a great deal worse off.\\nExperts (n) What we no longer need in post-referendum politics. When asked how it was that every respected economist believed that leaving the EU would be bad for the UK, Michael Gove announced in a live TV debate that “these people were just experts and nobody wants to listen to experts any more”. It turned out 52% of the country agreed with Gove, who was recently seen looking unkempt and unloved on holiday, and has since followed his own advice by taking up a second career as a newspaper columnist. Fact (n) Original meaning of “a statement that we know to be true” has been replaced by “any assertion that we would quite like to be true”. An essential component of any current debate (See Post-truth politics). As in “It is a fact that Brexit means Brexit’. Foreign Office (n) Formerly one of the great offices of state, the Foreign Office has been renamed the Department of Fun and Insults since Boris Johnson became foreign secretary. Hardworking families (n) Not to be confused with hard-working families, which are families that are hard-working. Hardworking families are those families that embody the true spirit of austerity and are first in line for a break when the politicians feel they are ready for one. These families are predominantly white, though a special exception can be made for some Asian families, and will include a father, mother and two children. Inquiry into an inquiry (n) An inquiry that is set up when the first inquiry fails to come up with the answers that was expected of it. Joining (n) A word that is not to be confused with the word joining. During the EU referendum, the Leave campaign repeatedly assured the country that “Turkey is joining the EU imminently.” This new usage confusingly means the opposite. As in, “Turkey is not joining the EU imminently.” Judge-led inquiry (n) An inquiry that is set up when an inquiry into an inquiry still fails to come up with answers that was expected of it. In exceptional circumstances, as in the failed Justice Goddard inquiry into historic cases of child sex abuse, there may be a judge-led inquiry into a judge-led inquiry.\\nKinder and gentler politics (ph) A saying created to show that people on the far left of the Labour party (see Corbynista) do have a sense of humour after all. Common usage as in “We are going to practise a kinder and gentler politics by throwing a brick through your window and calling anyone who disagrees with us “fascist Blairite scum” (see Blairite). Kitchen cabinet (n) A term used to describe a group of advisers whom the prime minister trusts more than the MPs she has officially appointed to her cabinet. With liabilities such as Boris Johnson, David Davis, Liam Fox, Jeremy Hunt, Priti Patel and Andrea Leadsom in the current cabinet, expect to hear more of Theresa May’s kitchen cabinet. Leavercrats (n) Someone in the civil service with the necessary expertise to negotiate Britain’s exit from the EU. Currently on the critically endangered list. As the EU has conducted all the UK’s trade negotiations for the past 40 years, the country has only about three trained trade negotiators in existence.\\nLong-term economic plan (ph) Term invented by David Cameron’s government to give the impression that it knew what it was doing. To be differentiated from the short-term economic plan, which meant “making it up as we go along and hoping for the best”. The long-term economic plan has now officially been abandoned since the EU referendum to be replaced by Brexit means Brexit. Mainstream media (ph) Sometimes abbreviated to MSM. Any part of the media that fails to acknowledge that Jeremy Corbyn is the messiah. Most commonly used as a term of abuse for the BBC, ITV, Sky, the Guardian, the Times, the Telegraph, the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Mirror. Everyone really. Milifandom (n) A noun used to describe a strange affliction which gripped a few people in may 2015, leading them to believe that Ed Miliband was a sex god. Moderates (n) Formerly used to describe those on the centre left of the Labour party. Now no longer used as everyone in the party is either a Red Tory (see Blairite) or a member of the hard left (see Corbynista). Neo-liberal consensus (ph) A form of abuse used by those on the far left and far right to describe what the majority of people in the country actually think. Neverendum (n) A term used to describe a situation in which you keep on having a referendum on something you’ve already had a referendum on until such time as neither side can remember what it was exactly they were supposed to be voting for. Notting Hill set (ph) A phrase used to describe a group of west London public school and Oxbridge opportunists who only went into politics because they thought it was their birthright and it might be a bit of a laugh and unexpectedly found themselves running the country for six years. The principal members of the Notting Hill set were the now discredited David Cameron, George Osborne and Michael Gove. Omnishambles (n) A situation in which everything that can possibly go wrong does go wrong. First used by the TV political satire The Thick of It and then comprehensively developed by George Osborne in at least three of his six budgets. (See also Ultrashambles.) Open for business (ph) As in “Britain is open for business.” What governments are obliged to say when they know that the economy is liable to tank at any minute and are desperate to say something vaguely reassuring. Guaranteed to have the opposite effect and cause panic in the financial markets. The very fact that someone is saying “Britain is open for business” is a sure sign that it probably isn’t. Points-based immigration (ph) A synonym for “I’m not a racist but ...” Those calling for an Australian points-based system to control immigration are the last ones likely to advocate it once they’ve seen it in action as there would be more people coming to the UK than there are now. But since even Ukip no longer think it’s OK just to say “Basically, I want to see a lot fewer foreigners here. End of”, everyone has to pretend they want “points-based immigration” targets instead. Post-truth politics (ph) A term used to describe a state in which politicians are no longer obliged to tell the truth and are content to make any assertions (see Facts) they feel like. Some commentators have argued that there has never been a truth politics as politicians have always lied when it is convenient for them; the only difference is that people have got better at realising when they are being lied to. In which case there is no post-truth politics. Only politics. Processology (n) A catch-all, derogatory word used by governments to describe the things they are not going to get in to but really ought to. As in “We aren’t going to get into the processology of Brexit now.” Can also be translated as “Don’t worry your pretty little heads with the detail.” Project Fear (ph) The successful rallying cry for the Vote Leave campaign in the EU referendum. Most commonly used when opponents produced some data from a reputable independent organisation which indicated that leaving the EU was likely to have a negative impact on the country. As in “We’re not going to listen to that as you’re only trying to scare us.” Real people (n) Sometimes also known as ordinary people. The voters politicians often like to talk about but do their best to avoid whenever possible. Regrexit (n) State of unease felt by some people who voted to leave the EU only to find out that many of the things they had been promised were never going to happy. Remoaners (n) Those people who voted to stay in the EU and find it hard to accept that Britain is on the cusp of a bright new future. Scroungers (n) A term used to denote anyone who is out of work, disabled or otherwise relies on the state for financial support. Scroungers are the enemy of civilised society and are one of the main reasons the government was forced to introduce austerity measures. Not to be confused with MPs massaging their expenses or going on unnecessary assertion-finding trips abroad. Squeezed middle (ph) Anyone earning between £25K and £50K per year who still feels a bit broke. Squeezed middle is commonly patronisingly used as a term of affection by politicians to show they understand how difficult the little people are finding life in times of economic hardship. It also goes without saying that the squeezed middle must understand they wouldn’t be feeling quite so squeezed if there weren’t so many unemployed people making demands on the state (see Scroungers). Ultrashambles (n) A more extreme version of the Omnishambles. (See Brexit means Brexit). As in “Donald Trump is heading for the White House, Boris Johnson is in the Foreign Office, Nigel Farage is on the loose and Jeremy Hunt is dismantling the NHS.” Valid concerns (ph) The recognition by government that many people in the country are intolerant of anything that doesn’t directly benefit them but their views need to be taken into consideration if it wants to get re-elected. As in “It is perfectly reasonable for people to have valid concerns about immigrants coming over here and marrying their daughter.”', 'We should have seen it coming, of course. A slightly tubby, (forcibly) retired politician waves his arms and stamps his feet around a ballroom floor. Hoots awa’! Expert judges – representatives of the metropolitan elite – wrinkle their noses and praise other contestants who can actually dance. But week after week our energetic stomper survives, living proof of provincial Britain’s rejection of talent or skill (in economics or anything else). Good for Edexit, strictly the spirit of our times. And could Boris please put himself down for an Argentinian tango in 2017?', 'Like many young Poles, Maria Fijalkowska has always wanted to study and work in England. “I have been to London and I loved it. I love the English language. I love the culture. I have thought about it for a long time,” she says. It is mid-morning in Warsaw and Fijalkowska is about to begin a class on Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales at the Institute of English Studies, part of the University of Warsaw. Her English is pretty fluent already and would be good enough for her to sign up for a psychology course in London, one of her long-held goals. But she is not sure about England any more.\\n“I have heard that there has been a rise in violence towards immigrants since Brexit and all the negative attitudes that the Brexit community and politicians have exposed people to. It is scary what you hear in the news with somebody attacked, not only Polish people but people of all nationalities. That is a problem. I had always wanted to go to London. I probably won’t now.” Instead, she is thinking about Scotland, if it remains in the EU. In the same class is Weronika Macuch, who also has excellent English and high ambitions. “I want to become a scholar,” she says. “And you have the best universities. But I have changed my decision now and decided to go to Ireland instead. They don’t want to leave the EU. I like the literature there. They don’t want to get rid of Polish people aggressively, like English people do. ‘Go home, Polish vermin!’ and that kind of stuff.” To hear young people talking about the UK in these terms – to learn that it had been top of their lists of preferred destinations a few months ago, but is now deleted from them, and feared – is disturbing. But this is Europe after the Brexit vote, a Europe in which EU citizens – from students charting first steps on their career paths, to those running governments and businesses – are recasting their judgments about the UK, accepting Brexit as a reality, and making other plans. From Paris to Brussels, and Berlin to Warsaw and Bratislava, there is much sadness that the British are leaving. In the central and eastern European member states in particular, governments will fight tooth and nail to ensure their people can still travel to, and work in, the UK post-Brexit. The right to move around the EU has symbolised, more than anything else, the break from their pre-1989 past under Soviet influence.\\nFrom his office in Bratislava, Slovakia’s state secretary at the foreign ministry, Ivan Korcok, can see Austria and speaks of the “emotional” importance of the EU to all Slovakians. “Our people are buying their apartments and building their houses across the border over there in Austria. Slovakia is a very pro-European country. People are concerned about the British situation [if it means they will no longer be able to move to and work in the UK]. The older generation here see their kids travelling abroad, and thinking differently to how they did. If one day a child in Slovakia decides to study elsewhere in Europe, including in the UK, and they can afford to, they go, they just go! This is such an emotional thing in positive terms about the EU.” Marek Prawda, Poland’s former ambassador to the EU and now head of the European commission in Warsaw, says: “For us, being an EU member is the inverse of what was said in your referendum campaign about ‘taking back control’. To us, being a member of the EU has been about gaining back control, about freedom, about security, about being able to run an economy in a modern way. EU membership was a chance to shape our own life. We are able to borrow and invest in our economy. We are part of a rational world.” The good news for them is that Poland and Slovakia are newly confident, and economically on a fast upward trajectory. Poland’s economy has grown 25% since the start of the financial crisis in 2008 and many Polish companies are crying out for workers. Slovakia’s is thriving too, and produces more cars than any other EU country, with Poland in second place. There is a future at home these days. Henryka Bochniartz, a former Polish minister of trade and industry who now heads her country’s equivalent of the CBI, the Polish confederation “Lewiatan”, says many Poles will return from the UK soon and fewer will go, even if free movement rules remain in place. The “pull factors” that persuaded hundreds of thousands of Poles to move to Britain since 2004 are beginning to operate the other way around. The Polish government is giving families 500 zloty a month for every child (around £100), a payment that Bochniartz says will persuade many to stay put and some to return. The post-1989 transition to a western economy has taken place and there is less reason to seek futures abroad. Bochniartz expects Polish companies to offer more “perks” to tempt workers back. Services companies are switching from London to Warsaw. Poland will be saddened and bruised by Brexit, but Bochniartz sees bright horizons beyond it. Perceptions of the UK as the place to go have changed, anyway, among all age groups. “In the media, small incidents [attacks on Polish people], which were probably on the fifth page of your newspapers, were on the front pages in Poland. So people will be looking to other countries and not to the UK.” In the immediate aftermath of the 23 June referendum, there was some faint hope in European capitals that the UK might change its mind, that a way might be found to reverse the decision. At the very least, EU leaders believed that the UK would remain a member of the single market. “It was difficult to accept here. Some tried to convince themselves that it was just an advisory referendum and that it wouldn’t happen and they never thought the UK could leave the single market,” said a senior British official working in the Brussels institutions.\\nAnother UK source in Brussels added: “There was the shock at first, then people went away for the summer and thought it might be containable, negotiable somehow.” But then the Tory party conference in Birmingham in October hardened attitudes and delivered clarity. The clear suggestions from Theresa May and her ministers that the UK would prioritise curbs on immigration – and refuse to accept free movement rules even if that meant leaving the single market – coupled with insistence that it would break free completely from the European court of justice, changed minds. In recent weeks orders have gone round the 27 other EU capitals that, if the UK wants this kind of “hard Brexit” and refuses to compromise, that is what it will get and must have. Olaf Wientzek, co-ordinator of European politics at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the thinktank of chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, insisted single market access and freedom of movement were inextricably linked. “I have been reading the British press and in some newspapers there is a hope that you can wiggle your way out of it. No. They are inextricably linked. It is a core principle. Here you are not cutting the fat. If we get the clear signal that there will be no compromise from the British, then I think it would be rather a hard Brexit.” The realisation has dawned that the dangers of anti-EU populism spreading in France and the Netherlands are far greater than that of losing the Brits, who were troublesome anyway and a brake on integration. Donald Trump’s success has compounded the fear. If Marine Le Pen or Geert Wilders could cite a soft exit for the UK as evidence that their countries could also break free of the EU at little cost, they would be even more of a danger in coming elections in their countries. Britain could be lost from the EU and the union would survive, but if Le Pen won and took France out, European integration would be dead. “If France were to leave the EU, that would be the end of it. We would be finished,” said Stephan Mayer, a Christian Social Union MP in the Bundestag and CSU home affairs spokesman. David McAllister is a German MEP and vice-president of the European People’s party in the European parliament, having been prime minister of Lower Saxony from 2010 to 2013. He is from the same party as Merkel (the CDU) and has been talked of as a potential successor. His father was a Daily Telegraph-reading Scottish civil servant stationed in Berlin, where David grew up and went to school. To this day, he has dual nationality. If anyone can understand the huge gulf between British and German attitudes to the EU, and how to find a route through Brexit negotiations that will satisfy both sides, it is McAllister. But he struggles to see one. He tears his hair out reading the UK media, and winces at the approach of UK ministers like defence secretary Michael Fallon, who said at a meeting in Bratislava in September that the UK would veto future EU defence plans even though it was leaving. “If you are leaving that is OK, but please don’t block further integration that won’t affect you. That did not go down well.” He rails at the way Boris Johnson warned of the danger of millions of Turks arriving in the UK before the referendum, then, as foreign secretary, went to Ankara to give his backing to Turkish accession. “Amazing, incredible,” says McAllister.\\nThe EU tried its damnedest to put together a package for David Cameron in February, which Cameron hoped would persuade UK voters to remain. “A lot of people underestimated how far other nations actually went then, how hard that was to achieve,” he says. “Then, it didn’t even play any role in the referendum at all. It was hardly mentioned. So there is no appetite for further British cherry-picking, keine Rosinenpickerei (no raisin-picking), as we say in Germany.” The ball, he says, is in the British court. “You can’t have 100% control over internal migration, say no to European court of justice rulings, and that you won’t pay anything [into the budget]. This just won’t work. We would love the Brits to at least stay in the single market, but we are hearing from London ‘we don’t want this, we don’t want that’.” No one, he says, “wants to be nasty” to the UK, but it is the one which has asked to leave. “We didn’t ask for this divorce. Sorry. But we are members of a family of nations and were happy to have our British neighbours, friends, allies in our family. But they have asked to leave the family. They have got to sort this out. “The British are of course testing us out – we all know that. They are testing how united Europe actually is. So what is important is that Europe stays together. No bilateral negotiations with the British. No cherry-picking. We are doing this as a bloc.” He spins round on his chair and pulls out a copy of the Bild newspaper, the German equivalent of the Sun, which dedicated an entire edition in mid-October to praising European integration with a front-page headline declaring: “We are Europe.” McAllister holds it up and asks: “Can you imagine the Sun ever doing that?” If the view is hardline towards the UK in Brussels, it is even more rock solid in Paris. There, fear stalks the establishment as presidential elections approach next spring. “There are echoes of De Gaulle in attitudes to the Brexit,” said a French diplomat. “Tough on the British when you came in, tough on you when you leave.” Le Pen is expected to win through to the second round runoff in May. Former prime minister and veteran centrist Alain Juppé is still favourite to enter the Elysée. But on the morning after Trump had pulled off his stunning win, no one in Paris was certain any more. A senior member of the French establishment, who has served his country in the EU and Washington, insists Le Pen now has to be taken very seriously. “If France has a French president who wants to get out of the euro and the EU, I think it is over. It disintegrates. The danger then is that you are left with a German Europe.” The French are keen to bind the UK into closer defence co-operation even after it leaves the EU, aware that the need to do so will be all the greater with Trump in the White House. Nicole Ameline, a French MP and member of the foreign affairs committee in the national assembly, says there is no plan for a European army, just for greater “operational and strategic organisation” between states, adding that “we have to pool more capacity, to go further on research, on drones, cyber, satellites” and to reinforce the EU’s ability to exercise “soft power”. She cites the EU’s Sophia operation in the Mediterranean, working to disrupt smuggling routes into the EU, as a model and says there is no reason why the UK would not want to develop more such operations. The EU plans would complement Nato not threaten it, she says. But French MEP Constance le Grip, who like Juppé is a member of the Republican party, says any special deals for the UK on the single market or other core areas are “absolutely unacceptable”. “The European project is not a supermarket. It is a not a cafeteria where you choose what you like,” she said. “If you start to reshape the whole project to be some sort of Europe à la carte it is the beginning of the end, apart from the fact that Madame Le Pen will then claim victory and Wilders in the Netherlands, and so on. More opt-outs for the UK would be absolutely incoherent and absurd. If you start to build a cafeteria, it is the end of Europe.” Le Grip does not believe Le Pen can win, but says the EU must show clarity about its future, and that means accepting it is the end of the road with the British. Her Paris constituents want the UK to leave now, and can’t understand why it still has any involvement at all. “They say, why do you still have British MEPs who vote in the parliament? Why have you just voted for a new British commissioner in Brussels? My constituents are even tougher than myself. They say ‘out, out, out’.” The hardline rhetoric from the French is not replicated in Berlin, though the underlying messages are the same, just more diplomatically stated. Merkel – who is expected to declare this weekend whether she will stand for a fourth term as chancellor – has been badly damaged by her “open door” migration policy. The Alternative für Deutschland party (the AfD, which, while critical of the EU, does not advocate leaving) beat the CDU into third place in a recent regional election in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a contest in which immigration played a big role.\\nBut there is no prospect of an anti-EU party posing a serious challenge in next autumn’s general election, or any national contest in the foreseeable future. Faith in the ideals of European integration remain as unshakeable in Germany as distrust and misunderstanding of them is widespread in the UK. Two days after Trump’s win, a woman gave a long anti-Trump monologue through a megaphone by the Brandenburg Gate before warning of the dangers of the US returning to protectionism and Russia developing new imperialist ambitions. “We must stay together as a united Europe to protect ourselves,” she shouted.\\nEurope is still integral to how Germans think of themselves; not as citizens of one assertive nation but as part of a union that binds many together. In Berlin, there is still a will to help the UK find a Brexit deal that will keep it close, and concern in some circles at the tone of comment from Paris about the UK. Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee, and a senior figure in the CDU close to Merkel, says “the French can probably eventually live without the UK inside the EU”, but for Germans that is a dreadful prospect. There is a risk, he says, of the UK and the rest of the EU becoming too entrenched in hardline positions before article 50 talks have begun. “On the continental side, we have a hardening, a view that there should be no compromise, the four freedoms have to stick together, you can’t separate them. So we see a danger of mutual escalation on both sides which is dangerous,” he says. He holds out hope of finding middle ground on free movement with the UK. “There has to be a compromise on immigration and free movement of workers because this is the issue on which Theresa May has to deliver before the next parliamentary elections in the UK.” Röttgen seems to appreciate, particularly after Trump’s win, that if the EU sounds too unbending the impression will be left that the European elite is blind to the forces that unleashed Brexit and delivered the new US president, and that this could bolster the Front National in France and populist movements elsewhere in the EU. It is too early to be “gloomy” about a deal giving the UK access to the single market. But the compromises he seems to have in mind would require considerable movement by the Brits. Asked whether a deal could be struck if the UK insists on ending free movement, shunning all ECJ jurisdiction and paying nothing into the EU budget, he is clear that it would be impossible, and mean saying bye-bye to the UK. “Of course, if the British position would be no, no, no everywhere, then it is simply going apart. I am really ready to come to a result, but then even I would have to say that there is no common ground. If you want to have a relationship, you have to accept some common ground.” When it is put to him that the anti-EU purists in the Tory party, urged on by their cheerleaders in the British press, will not agree to any article 50 deal, or subsequent transitional arrangements for the UK after the two-year period is over that would mean a role for the EU’s supranational institutions in UK affairs, he asks despairingly if these people have any idea of the damage they will inflict on their country. Back in Brussels, McAllister provides him with the answer and confirmation of what everyone is beginning to accept. It is the end of this road, and the path ahead will be rocky. “I am so friendly for obvious reasons,” he says. “I am so sad to say this in the British media, but I don’t believe the Brits really understood Europe in the 45 years they have been members and only now as they leave they will have to understand.”\\nPARIS Attitude to the EU As one of the original six signatories to the Treaty of Rome in 1957, which set up the EEC, the French establishment is solidly pro-EU, seeing it as a way to ensure stability on the continent and contain Germany. Anti-EU forces at play Marine Le Pen’s Front National is anti-immigration and anti-EU. She is expected to get to the second round of presidential elections in May, then lose to an establishment figure, probably Alain Juppé. But after Donald Trump, anything is possible. Approach to Brexit. Hard or soft? France has always been tough on Britain, from the 1960s when President de Gaulle tried to veto UK entry into the common market. Now it fears a soft Brexit would allow Le Pen to say France could leave the EU without much economic, or other, pain. The French would not weep if the UK left. Verdict Very hard Brexit. BRATISLAVA Attitudes to the EU Slovakia joined the EU in 2004 and its economy has prospered. It also joined the euro, at the start of 2009. Immigration and open borders are a big concern, but it is broadly pro-EU and happy with membership. Anti-EU forces Early this year the far-right People’s party launched a petition for a referendum on the country’s EU membership. In elections in March the party won 8% of the vote and entered parliament for the first time. Attitude to Brexit Slovakia holds the EU presidency and hopes a deal can be reached to keep Britain in the single market. But it will also be keen to attract UK business, perhaps a car plant or two, if the UK quits. Verdict Hard Brexit if it benefits Slovakia. BRUSSELS Attitude to the EU Brussels is home to the European commission, the EU’s executive, whose role is to drive integration forward, and one of the two homes of the European parliament. (The other being Strasbourg.) The citadel of the true believers. Anti-EU forces Almost none, except the MEPs from anti-EU parties who gather for meetings of the European parliament. Approach to Brexit Brussels takes the view that the UK has decided to leave and must do so with no special deals that would encourage other countries to follow it. Verdict Very hard Brexit. WARSAW Attitude to the EU Poland joined in 2004, and a recent poll showed 81% want to stay. It receives billions in aid for agriculture and infrastructure projects, and its economy has expanded dramatically since it joined. Many Poles do not like immigration, but do like their own right to move freely to other EU states. Anti-EU forces The ruling Law and Justice party is Eurosceptic but not in favour of pulling out. It has often criticised the EU’s stance on migration and opposes plans to take mandatory quotas of refugees. Approach to Brexit Poland sees the UK as an ally on economic and security issues. But it will not give up the rights of Poles to live and work in the UK without extracting a price in the form of excluding the UK from the single market. Verdict Pragmatically hard Brexit. BERLIN Attitude towards the EU Germany was a founding member, along with France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, and EU integration defines establishment thinking in postwar Germany. Pooling powers and building a European identity is seen as the way to forget the past and dissolve the nation state into a bigger, stronger, more stable entity. Profoundly pro-EU. Anti-EU forces at play Euroscepticism takes a much milder form than in the UK. The Alternative für Deutschland party has built support by channelling concerns about migration. It is critical of Brussels and the EU, but does not promote leaving. Approach to Brexit Germany is desperate to keep the UK in, for historical reasons as much as anything – but not at any cost. The need to keep the other 27 together is more important to them than keeping the UK happy. Verdict A hard Brexit if the UK refuses to compromise.', 'As the committee stage of the article 50 bill rumbled on into its second day, Brexit minister David Jones had an announcement to make. After careful consideration of the possibility that there might be rather too many Tory rebels for comfort, the government was prepared to allow parliament a vote on Britain’s withdrawal from and future relationship with the EU before the deal was voted on by the European parliament. Keir Starmer punched the air in triumph. The government had been ground into the dust and he was now officially the face of effective opposition. “This is a major and welcome concession,” he said with as much gravitas as he could muster. Only then did the shadow Brexit secretary notice the look of surprise on Jones’s face. Starmer is a lovely, decent man but he’s not necessarily the lawyer you’d want fighting your cause. “Let me be clear,” said Jones. “We’re calling it a concession because we need to be seen to be making a concession. But to avoid any confusion, this concession is most definitely not a concession.” What it was, was a meaningless diversion to allow some of the Tory remainers to feel a bit better about themselves when they voted with the government later in the afternoon. “So this isn’t a concession, is it?” asked Ken Clarke. Jones smiled wanly. He didn’t know how to put this any plainer. All that was on offer was a vote on a deal or no deal. With just a couple of minutes to debate it. Just as Theresa May had promised in her Lancaster House speech. Parliament could either accept whatever bad deal the government managed to negotiate with the EU or it could jump off a cliff by going straight to World Trade Organisation rules. “But for a vote to be meaningful,” Labour’s Chuka Umunna pointed out, “parliament must be able to send the government back to the EU to renegotiate”. A howl escaped Jones’s lips. That was precisely why there wasn’t going to be a meaningful vote. How many more times did he have to repeat himself? If he had made a concession, and Jones was certain he hadn’t, then it had been to allow a meaningless meaningful vote. A vote whose only meaning was in its absence of meaning. It took the SNP’s Alex Salmond to get the message. “A Hobson’s choice is not a choice at all,” he said. “Surely it makes sense to know your destination before invoking article 50.” Choosing to trigger article 50 before the end of March was a totally arbitrary deadline and if the government was serious about this announcement then it would have included it as an amendment in the bill rather than just casually bring it up in conversation. “Finally,” Jones muttered under his breath. If the government’s non-concessionary concession wasn’t cutting much ice with anyone on the opposition benches – other than Starmer, who was still declaring Labour had won a significant victory – it was having the desired effect on possible Tory rebels. “I believe a significant concession has been offered,” announced Dominic Grieve, the former attorney-general and normally one of the brighter minds on the Conservative benches, “so I now feel comfortable voting with the government.” Labour’s Angela Smith interrupted Grieve to let him know that the government had just given a briefing in which it had been made clear there were no concessions whatsoever. Grieve was not to be thrown off track and insisted the government didn’t know what it was talking about; even if it couldn’t see it had made a concession then he could. Nicky Morgan tweeted her enthusiasm for the “big concessions” – a sure sign that she was having second thoughts and was planning to abstain. Only Anna Soubry openly declared her willingness to vote for Chris Leslie’s amendment for a properly meaningful vote. But it wasn’t enough. The government was home and dry. One by one the Tory snowflakes had melted away until just seven rebels remained. The party that had taken us into Europe and had campaigned for us to stay in it during the referendum was about to take us out. A hard Brexit was a-gonna fall.', '', 'Two months ago on Tuesday, Britain voted to leave the European Union. The shock was immense; the fallout dramatic. But then summer came. The early turbulence subsided and normality (more or less) returned. Brexit, though, has not yet begun to happen. The government does not know what it wants and is not yet equipped to ask for it. Britain and the EU, it is increasingly clear, are far more intimately enmeshed than the leave camp had claimed. For all the leavers’ assurances, extricating the UK from the bloc, negotiating new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world – and ensuring that Britain’s laws and practices adapt – is a gargantuan undertaking. The referendum result, however, is a political reality. The 52% of leave voters – and the politicians who represented them – expect it to be acted upon. So two months on, where does Brexit stand?\\nThe machinery – and the cost One of the first acts of the new prime minister, Theresa May, was to establish two new ministries: the Department for Exiting the European Union, led by David Davis, and the Department for International Trade, headed by Liam Fox. Neither is yet fully up and running. Worse, a predictable and potentially damaging turf war already appears to be under way between Fox’s ministry and the last of the cabinet’s three Brexiters, Boris Johnson at the Foreign Office. That aside, International Trade has so far secured about 10% of the trade negotiators it needs. (Britain has few skilled personnel because the EU negotiates trade deals for its members. Canada, in contrast, has 300.) Meanwhile, DExEU, as it is known, has hired – mainly from elsewhere in the civil service – 150 of the 250-300 total staff it is expected to employ, and reportedly has yet to move into its permanent home. With the civil service a fifth smaller since 2010, fast-stream recruits are being drafted in, but negotiators, lawyers, economists, regulatory experts and management consultants from the private sector will prove essential. They will not come cheap: experienced senior personnel from the likes of KPMG, PwC, Linklater’s and McKinsey cost up to £5,000 a day, recruitment consultants say, or will be seconded on annual salaries of up to £250,000.\\nSome estimates suggest “full Brexit” may take 10 years and involve up to 10,000 people, not only in the new and other so-called “hot” departments such as foreign, home, environment and business, but across the civil service nationally, at an administrative cost of close to £5bn. Hannah White, Brexit lead at the Institute for Government, claims such figures are “finger in the wind” stuff but warns that with all the government has set out to achieve besides Brexit “there is clearly going to have to be a really, really strong process of prioritisation”. The model – and why it matters The government has not yet decided what trade relationship it wants with the EU. A huge amount hangs on the choice between “membership of” and “access to” the EU’s single market. European leaders have repeatedly stressed that membership of the single market as part of the European Economic Area (like, say, Norway) will mean accepting EU immigration, obeying EU rules and making a contribution to the EU budget. Single market membership would make Brexit a lot easier to implement and could – according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies – be worth roughly 4% to the UK’s GDP. It is, however, unacceptable to many leave voters (and Norway may not let the UK join its club anyway).\\nOne alternative is a free trade agreement with the EU, such as Canada’s recent deal; but this gives Britain only limited access to the single market. Although that may be politically acceptable, it would take longer to agree and could hit the economy harder – especially the all-important services sector; trade deals are invariably much tougher on services than on goods. Recent signs indicate the government may be mulling a deal outside the single market as the only option acceptable to voters. May has spoken of a “bespoke” agreement, and ITV’s Robert Peston reckons Whitehall is aiming for a deal based on Canada’s, albeit with “a bespoke add-on for services”. The City reportedly wants an arrangement along the lines of the complex patchwork of bilateral sectoral accords Switzerland has agreed with the EU for access to parts of the single market – though the Swiss, problematically, had to accept freedom of movement and EU regulations as part of their deal. Before any decision can be made, DExEU has to work out exactly which bits of single market membership – including non-tariff barriers, the common regulations, licences and standards that, for example, give UK banks their “passport” to operate across the EU – are most valuable, and what they are worth. The politics – and the timing May’s catchphrase that “Brexit means Brexit” may disguise Whitehall’s uncertainty about what Brexit actually means, but it does commit to deliver it – and there are plenty pushing to ensure it does. The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has threatened to return to the fray if nothing happens soon and there are many within May’s own party and the broader leave camp who believe all Brexit requires is for article 50 of the Lisbon treaty to be triggered and a short act of parliament to be passed. That constitutes a “hard” Brexit: crashing out of the EU and the single market with no economic safety net beyond WTO rules, which would mean costly tariffs. The “soft” approach – taking time to negotiate an exit and a preferential trade arrangement – is plainly the government’s favoured course. May has repeatedly said she would not trigger article 50, the two-year process by which Britain must leave the EU, before the beginning of next year. Some think March looks a likely moment.\\nBut there is a persistent rumour that late 2017 or even early 2018 is more likely, partly because it could take Whitehall at least that long to be ready before triggering the two-year exit talks, and partly because Dutch, French and German elections will get in the way. That would mean Britain would not leave the EU until late 2019, which the pro-Brexit camp as well as the EU, which wants Brexit over before the 2019 European elections and the new EU budget in 2020, have said emphaticallyis not desirable. Some observers argue that since the Tory leadership has never been capable of resisting its Eurosceptic wing (of which Davis and Fox – the day-to-day Brexit ministers – are hardcore members), the talks may prove short-lived: a “hard” Brexit could happen. Those other negotiations ... Assuming Brexit remains soft, article 50 is just the beginning, covering the essential details of the divorce: who pays the pensions of Britain’s EU staff, where the EU institutions based in Britain end up. As well as the article 50 talks a raft of others must follow, including on Britain’s new trade deal with the EU, which could prove so complicated it requires an interim agreement to tide things over. Then Britain’s full WTO membership must be re-established (which means drawing up a new set of national tariffs, a monumental task, and winning approval from 164 countries), and the 50-plus free trade agreements negotiated by the EU on its members’ behalf renegotiated.\\nPlus, as Charles Grant, of the Centre for European Reform, points out, new deals will be needed on European security, defence, the environment, science and research and, in all probability, Northern Ireland. And that takes no account of the changes needed in UK domestic laws and regulations. Brexit, notes Dominic Cook of Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, is “the biggest transformational project a UK government has ever undertaken” not only because of foreign negotiations but “the inward-facing part: implementing and educating in the UK”. The legal challenges The most immediate obstacle to Brexit is judicial. There is a substantial school of thought which says the government is not constitutionally entitled to pull the trigger on article 50 without the specific approval of parliament. At least seven private actions have been grouped together and will be heard by the high court starting in October in what judges have said is a “matter of great constitutional importance”, with a decision possible by the end of the year. Separately, cases have been launched in Northern Ireland arguing that Brexit would breach the Good Friday agreement by reinstating a physical border with the Republic of Ireland and undermining the legal basis for the 1998 peace deal. So, while we may be two months in, you might want to get used to the waiting. Brexit may not happen quite yet. This article was amended on 22 August 2016. An earlier version said DExEU civil servants were holding meetings in Starbucks, and the subheading said they did not yet have an office. The department has asked us to clarify that its civil servants do have offices and cafes are not used for formal meetings.', 'Brexit does not need to resemble Nigel Farage’s idea of leaving the European Union, Ukip’s sole MP has said. Douglas Carswell also praised Gina Miller, the woman at the centre of the supreme court case to prevent Theresa May triggering article 50 without parliamentary approval. The MP for Clacton told at a Guardian Politics Live event in Kings Cross on Tuesday night: “Brexit does not mean Nigel Farage’s vision of Brexit.” Appearing on a panel with Miller and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, Carswell appealed for what he described as a “new national consensus”. “We need to try to draw people together. The referendum was quite divisive … [but] the poll was actually relatively close,” he said. “I’ve argued consistently that that means no one has carte blanche to rewrite things the way they want to rewrite them.”\\nThe MP, who triggered a byelection in 2014 when he decided to leave the Tories, also said he did not want to live in a country where calls were made encouraging people to march on the supreme court. The supreme court’s 11 judges are deciding whether the government has the right to trigger article 50 without a vote in the Commons after ministers appealed against the high court’s ruling. Carswell said: “I admire Gina for what she is going. It takes a certain something to put your head above the parapet on an issue like this.” He also said Theresa May was doing a “pretty good job … so far, so good”. He claimed that negotiating new trade deals post-Brexit would be “relatively straightforward” despite admitting that the UK’s arrangements with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) came through our EU membership. However, Miller argued that the UK had “not done trade deals for a long time” and lacked the expertise in Whitehall. Thornberry said it was time for the government to come clean about the options for Brexit and how they would affect the economy: “The British public have had enough of being lied to.” She vehemently rejected accusations that Labour was partly to blame for the referendum being lost. In response to a question from the audience about party unity, the shadow foreign secretary said the challenge to Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership by Owen Smith was a “huge distraction”. “We are in the process of pulling ourselves back together again, but I think it was a wasted six months,” she said. “The ill-discipline of some of our members of parliament is very unfortunate. The Tories fight worse than we do; it’s just that whenever we fight, we open our hearts and we bleed all over the newspapers. Every time we fight, everybody knows everything. I just wish we could have a bit more discipline – remember what we’re in politics for.” Miller won the warmest applause of the evening for her argument that our political system needs fundamental change: “The snake-oil salesmen are setting up people for more disaster. Things will not get better; they will get worse before they get better. Everyone’s over-promising that they can get things right … All of politics should change.”', 'The UK faces the stark choice of either a hard Brexit or no Brexit, the president of the European council has said – the first time he has taken such a clear line on the likely outcome of the UK’s exit talks. Just hours after the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, had told a committee of MPs he was confident Britain could strike a better trade deal with the EU after Brexit, Donald Tusk used a speech in Brussels to scotch the idea that Britain can “have its cake and eat it”. Speaking to an audience of policymakers in Brussels on Thursday, Tusk – who chairs EU leaders’ summits – said it was useless to speculate about a soft Brexit, in which the UK remained a member of the single market. “The only real alternative to a hard Brexit is no Brexit, even if today hardly anyone believes in such a possibility.” Without naming Johnson, notorious in Brussels for his jokey phrase that Britain could have its cake and eat it, Tusk criticised “the proponents of the cake philosophy” who argued the UK could be part of the EU single market without bearing any of the costs.\\n“That was pure illusion, that one can have the EU cake and eat it too. To all who believe in it, I propose a simple experiment. Buy a cake, eat it, and see if it is still there on the plate.” Business groups, Labour, and moderate Conservative backbenchers have all urged the government to strike a deal that maintains many of the benefits of the single market. Johnson had earlier told the cross-party foreign affairs select committee: “We are going to get a deal which is of huge value and possibly of greater value … We are going to get the best possible deal for trade in goods and services.” But Tusk warned that Brexit would leave both Britain, and the rest of the EU, worse off. “There will be no cakes on the table, for anyone. There will be only salt and vinegar.”\\nHis intervention is likely to heighten anxiety in the City about the potential costs of Brexit after the rapid sell-off of sterling in recent days, which was sparked after Theresa May appeared to signal at the start of the Conservative party conference that she favoured a clean break with the rest of the EU. Senior ministers privately blame each other for exacerbating the market instability. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is said to be concerned that some of his colleagues are failing to grasp the full scale of the risks the government faces as it navigates through the complex process of Brexit; he, in turn, is singled out by others for warning of an economic “rollercoaster” in his conference speech last week. Johnson struck a defiantly optimistic tone at Thursday’s hearing, saying: “Those who prophesied doom have been proved wrong, and will continue to be proved wrong.” He also told MPs he believed the term “single market” was “increasingly useless”\\nSimon Tilford, deputy director of pro-EU thinktank the Centre for European Reform, said the markets would be scrutinising the government’s actions closely. “They’ve had a honeymoon, and it’s very clearly over,” he said. “It’s pretty clear that of the leading members of the government, only Philip Hammond understands the gravity of the situation.” He added: “What’s really spooked people is the suspicion that they really don’t know what they’re doing.” Tusk stressed that EU leaders would conduct the negotiations in good faith, but said the UK could not get a better deal than if it remained in the EU. May has repeatedly insisted she will not give a “running commentary” on the progress of the talks with Britain’s EU partners, but Tusk’s speech underlined the fact that other participants are unlikely to hold back. The prime minister has rejected the terms hard and soft Brexit as a false choice, promoted by those who have not accepted the result of the referendum, but her statement in her conference speech that she would insist on immigration controls and reject the oversight of the European court of justice was widely interpreted as a signal that she expects Britain to leave the single market. Tusk said the leave campaign and its “Take back control” slogan showed the UK wanted to be free of EU law while rejecting free movement of people and contributions to the EU budget. “This approach has definitive consequences, both for the position of the UK government and for the whole process of negotiations,” he said. “Regardless of magic spells, this means a de facto will to radically loosen relations with the EU – something that goes by the name of hard Brexit.”', 'Ken Clarke has been in superb form since becoming the only Conservative MP with the bottle to vote against the Brexit bill, despite so many more sharing his belief that it is counter to national interests. The former chancellor was scathing about suggestions that countries will queue up to give Britain beneficial trade deals. Although never really a party moderniser, he also made pertinent points about the retoxification of the Tories, arguing that the country has in effect fallen under the control of a group of former fringe rebels.\\nIn one telling passage of his speech to parliament last week – slating the Alice in Wonderland vision of Brexit – he said that Enoch Powell would “probably find it amazing that his party had become Eurosceptic and rather mildly anti-immigrant, in a very strange way, in 2016. Well, I am afraid that, on that issue, I have not followed it, and I do not intend to do so.” Quite right too. Nor do I intend to jump on this nativist bandwagon. Yet among the tragedies of recent events has been the fact that this fear-filled mood of division and intolerance was aided by people I once stood alongside in attempting to modernise the Conservatives. I do not blame Theresa May, although she first branded Tories “the nasty party” and now drives Britain into the wall of hardline Brexit. As prime minister she has no option but to respect the referendum result, although I quibble with her interpretation that immigration controls are more important than anything else. But as divided countries turn to protectionism founded on hostility to foreigners, how sad that the flames of populism engulfing the west have been fanned by British people who proclaim themselves as globalists. These are the so-called liberal leavers, who provided the veneer of respectability for a Brexit campaign founded on misanthropy. Nigel Farage and his friends were always the sort of small-minded folk who scapegoated foreigners for wider political failures: remember when the then Ukip leader even blamed migrants for his being trapped in a traffic jam? But it is unlikely that Farage would have pulled off that incredible referendum result without having a few prominent Tories on the party’s moderate wing in the vanguard of their pessimistic army. I thought about joining them – but only for a moment. I am no fan of Brussels, having seen first hand the damage caused by the euro and flawed refugee policies, and I desperately want Britain to be more openly engaged in the world. It did not take long to realise these ideals were unlikely to be achieved in harness with the most extreme elements in politics and in alliance with parties fuelled by hatred – especially in the current climate. Or to work out that disentangling from the world’s biggest economy would be hugely disruptive and probably hinder, not help, the cause of free trade.\\nSo I found it depressing to see the likes of Steve Hilton and Michael Gove promote Brexit in tandem with Farage after all their efforts to make their party more appealing to women, young people and ethnic minorities. As mayor of London, Boris Johnson was leader of a city built on tolerance, but then led the leave campaign. Scores of backbenchers shared their views, then jumped into bed with divisive nationalists. Even Daniel Hannan, perhaps the most persistent Brexit campaigner, espouses a decently liberal global outlook. These people hold a Big World vision of post-Brexit Britain. Hannan claimed the key issue in last year’s vote was democracy, not migration, and hours after the result even said he hoped free movement would not be impeded. Andrew Lilico, a leave economist used to counter other experts, insisted they never wanted “illiberal and anti-foreigner” policies when pushing to take back control. Yet with weary inevitability the referendum was seized on by the new prime minister, devoid of meaningful opposition, to pursue her relentless immigration clampdown. Now look at events abroad. In the United States a president lashes out at refugees and endorses Vladimir Putin’s world view. Donald Trump used Brexit as his template for an anti-establishment insurgency founded on falsehoods and smears against foreigners. He called himself Mr Brexit, reportedly wants to see the EU smashed to smithereens, and is admired by white supremacists. Meanwhile in France and the Netherlands we see far-right candidates ride alarmingly high in polls as elections loom, praising Brexit while preaching similar anti-globalisation and anti-Muslim sermons.\\nHow proud those liberal leavers must be as they survey this new world order, having done so much to foster the nationalist revolts. Still these people pose as optimists and rightly promulgate globalisation; but they must bear some responsibility for hitching themselves to forces of fear, then exploiting the concerns of communities buffeted by global forces and suffering from long-term government failures. These Brexiters played with fire by pandering to populism. And now the world is burning. Instead of bridges being built, walls are going up around the west. Perhaps the liberal leavers will recant and apologise, but more likely they will find excuses and blame others rather than search their own souls. It pains me to say this, since some are my friends, but the truth is that if they really believed breaking from Brussels would lead to a more open nation and outward-looking world, they should hang their heads in shame for stunning naivety.', 'Theresa May has warned MPs not to obstruct the Brexit bill during its second phase of debate in the House of Commons, as Labour failed in its attempt to secure regular parliamentary scrutiny of the EU negotiations. The prime minister called on MPs not to use parliamentary procedures to delay the passage of the bill, which will be debated over the next three days.\\nDozens of amendments have been tabled by Labour and opposition MPs in the hope of getting enough cross-party support to secure better parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit, the rights of EU nationals living in the UK, access to the single market and a more meaningful vote at the end of the two-year negotiations. However, the House of Commons opposed a Labour amendment that would have forced May to make regular reports back to parliament every two months by 333 to 284 – a majority of 49 for the government. Another Labour amendment calling for the leaders of the devolved administrations to be consulted and have their views taken into account before any final Brexit deal also failed by 333 votes to 276 – an even bigger government majority of 57. There were angry scenes in the House of Commons before the vote as only two Scottish, one Welsh and one Northern Ireland MP were given time to speak in the debate. Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP who was cut off by the deputy speaker, said it showed that Westminster holds Scotland’s views in contempt.\\nMay had earlier argued that any move to slow down the passage of the bill was tantamount to obstructing the verdict of the June referendum. “Our European partners now want to get on with the negotiations, so do I, and so does this House, which last week voted by a majority of 384 in support of the government triggering article 50,” she said. “There are of course further stages for the bill in committee and in the Lords and it is right that this process should be completed properly. But the message is clear to all – this House has spoken and now is not the time to obstruct the democratically expressed wishes of the British people. “It is time to get on with leaving the European Union and building an independent, self-governing, global Britain.” Some senior Conservative MPs and ministers were even put on a bus back from the party’s annual Black and White Ball to be present for the crucial parliamentary vote but the first Labour amendment was fairly easily defeated. Opposition MPs are more hopeful of gaining support from rebel Tories during the next two days on the issues of guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals in the UK or a more meaningful vote on at the end of the two year negotiations. Some Conservatives have indicated they could be willing to back amendment 110 tabled by Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, calling for “any new deal or treaty” with the EU to be put to a vote before both houses of parliament. This would give MPs the opportunity to reject any exit terms they felt unsatisfactory. However, the government is fairly confident it will be able to withstand any rebellion on the Tory benches, which would have to be sizeable to succeed. Speaking in the House of Commons, May hinted that more detail could be given about the form of the vote after negotiations when David Davis, the Brexit secretary, addresses parliament on Tuesday, which may be enough to dissuade backbench Conservatives from rebelling. Labour’s shadow cabinet will decide on Tuesday whether to back the Brexit bill on the final vote, regardless of whether their amendments pass. Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, told the parliamentary party on Monday night that he was in favour of “consistency” in whipping, suggesting the party will stick to its position of asking MPs to vote in favour of triggering article 50. However, it is understood some shadow cabinet ministers have been pressing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to abstain on the final vote, which would be in keeping with his promise not to block the bill. The scale of division facing the party over Brexit was underlined after one of Corbyn’s key trade union backers called on Labour MPs to defy the whip if the leadership asks them to vote for an unamended bill in favour of triggering article 50. Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the TSSA union, which backed Corbyn’s two leadership campaigns, said he supported Labour’s vote in favour of article 50 last week, but the bill should not be allowed to pass unamended. In particular, he said Labour should not vote for Brexit without receiving guarantees about the rights of EU nationals to stay in the UK and other key amendments on workers’ rights and parliamentary scrutiny. “The idea of the Tories deploying the threat of mass deportation of EU families living here as a negotiating ace is unacceptable,” he wrote in an article for the Guardian. “That alone should be enough to prove why waving through an unamended Tory Brexit bill is a big mistake. “If Labour’s amendments fail, then the facts change and our Labour party must face that circumstance and do the right thing and whip our MPs into voting against an unamended Tory Brexit. If they don’t, then our MPs must do the right thing and vote against it anyway.” Corbyn told May on Monday that guaranteeing the position of EU nationals in the UK was a matter of human rights and decency. However, the prime minister said it was “not the right way forward” to make a unilateral declaration preserving their rights when UK nationals in the rest of the EU have no such assurances yet. “As I have said before, EU citizens living in the UK make a vital contribution to our economy and our society and without them we would be poorer and our public services weaker,” she said. “So we will make securing the reciprocal agreement that will guarantee their status a priority as soon as the negotiations begin, and I want to see this agreed as soon as possible because that is in everyone’s interests.”', 'No one seems to have informed Tom Stoppard that he is shortly to turn 80, and could by rights be slowing down. Last autumn he delivered the script of a film adaptation of A Christmas Carol for director Bennett Miller, then helped rehearse a revival of his comedy Travesties at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London, directed by Patrick Marber. After that, he decamped to the US to shepherd his most recent work, The Hard Problem, on stage in San Francisco. This month, just as Travesties transfers to the West End, a starry 50th-anniversary production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead opens at the Old Vic, with the playwright, as ever, paying obsessive attention. It’s a wonder he gets any time to write, I say. He purses his lips. “The proportion of time in which I spend what I think of as the writer’s life is shrinking, and the proportion I spend doing everything else is increasing.” In the mildest of tones, he adds: “It makes me quite grumpy.” We meet during rehearsals for Rosencrantz – a process he finds as unsettling as it is fascinating, as he reacquaints himself with a script he wrote more than half a century ago. Back then, Stoppard was a former journalist and part-time critic with just one novel and a few short TV and radio dramas to his name. I wonder whether he still recognises himself. He sits, head cocked, assessing the question. “It certainly feels like the self I used to be. I remember him well. Some of the writing is a little dandy-esque, as he was. At that time, I attached more importance to the joys of receiving the right words in the right order, probably too little importance to the motor that kept the wheels turning.”\\nHe adds that with the current revival he hasn’t been able to resist giving the motor a little more oomph, as he did with Travesties – a few small changes, enough to make it feel fresh. “I don’t see the point of being present at rehearsals without being willing to improve matters. Years have passed, your idea of what’s humorous changes, your taste changes. I think actors also rather like the idea that you’re doing small things that have not been done before, just for them.” The story of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s debut at the Edinburgh fringe in 1966 has become so mythologised that it’s a relief to find it is indeed true. The company was amateur; by the time the 29-year-old Stoppard got into rehearsals, the director and female lead had walked out. On opening night, the audience was in the low double digits, and the Scottish press were befuddled: “What’s it all about, Tom?” ran one headline. Then, on the train back to London, Stoppard opened the Observer to discover a review by Ronald Bryden praising the production to the skies. By the time the playwright had returned home, a telegram from critic Kenneth Tynan – who had recently joined the National as Laurence Olivier’s first literary manager – was waiting. The next spring, Rosencrantz was at the Old Vic, then the NT’s base, and the Sunday Times was declaring it the “most important event” since the arrival of Pinter. Broadway soon beckoned.\\nWhat is frequently overlooked is that the idea for the play wasn’t Stoppard’s. It belonged to his then-agent Kenneth Ewing, who observed his young client’s obsession with Hamlet and suggested the idea of retelling the action from the wings, with the Prince’s duplicitous chums haplessly awaiting instructions and attempting, like Beckett’s Vladimir and Estragon before them, to fill the time. Fresh in Stoppard’s mind was Peter O’Toole’s starring performance in Hamlet in 1963, the first play to be produced by the NT. But finding a script that was more than a one-line gag was a convoluted process. The first incarnation was a one-act sketch, now lost (“not intentionally, but I’m quite thankful, really”). Then came a weightier three-act version that languished unproduced at the Royal Shakespeare Company, who couldn’t scrape together the money. Though its diamond-sharp dialogue and metaphysical barrel rolls now appear effortless – prefiguring the dazzling intellectual displays of Jumpers (1972) and Travesties (1974) – they were anything but, the playwright recalls: “I was in the same situation they were in, just trying to keep something going.” What’s most surprising about re‑encountering Rosencrantz is how moving it is, as the protagonists confront the dismal fact that they are mere bit players in someone else’s story. The script glitters with the witty metatheatrical conceits that Stoppard subsequently made his own: “We’re actors,” one of the Players cries, “we’re the opposite of people!”. But we never forget that the one inevitability awaiting these two men, according to the dictates of fate and Shakespearean tragedy, is death. As Guildenstern grimly puts it: “no one gets up after death – there is no applause … only silence and some secondhand clothes”. It is a sermon aimed as much at us in the auditorium as at the Prince of Denmark.\\nI wonder if this refutes a charge sometimes laid against Stoppard, that his plays – particularly the earliest ones – contain too much brain, too little heart. “Perhaps. It’s not an unintelligible idea to me that at a certain point my plays warmed up and became less defensive, less self-referential.” He shrugs. “It wasn’t a question I bothered myself with – am I being too cold, too warm, not warm enough, whatever. I just wrote the way that interested me.” Travesties, too, contains more sadness than is sometimes allowed, particularly in Marber’s revival. It, too, experiments with motifs of chance – in this case the coincidence that James Joyce, Lenin and the Dadaist Tristan Tzara were all living in Zurich in 1917, and that Joyce directed an amateur production of The Importance of Being Earnest while there. From these unlikely factual materials, Stoppard spins an elaborate series of fantasies, filtered through the memories – unreliable and increasingly unhinged – of a diplomat who participated in the production. Just as Rosencrantz explores the existential terror of being a small role in Hamlet, so Travesties suggests that what lies beneath Wilde’s kaleidoscopic riff on mistaken identity lies the terror of forgetting who we really are.\\nStoppard insists he has no favourites among his oeuvre, but it is revealing, perhaps, that the work he most relished tackling was 1997’s The Invention of Love. Within an apparently desiccated subject – the irreproachably English life and frustrated loves of the scholar-poet AE Housman – Stoppard found a seam of raw, turbulent emotion, moving from Sophocles’s definition of love as like “a piece of ice held fast in the fist” to Housman’s own words to his beloved male friend: “I would have died for you but I never had the luck!” It is far from accidental that Wilde makes an appearance here, too. “I think I liked writing that play more than any other, really,” Stoppard reflects. “I felt I understood Housman, which is possibly a presumption, but I knew the man.” The plays are a faithful expression of his own makeup, he says; and that makeup is more emotionally volatile than he is sometimes given credit for. “I actually would much rather write a play that makes people cry; whether with horror or happiness is the secondary issue.” He stops, frustrated that this answer isn’t polished enough, and switches tack. “I’m willing to say that essentially I write plays of ideas, and I hope there’s enough human tissue in them to make them more than that. I don’t know whether I’ve always succeeded in that, but that’s the hope.”\\nThe question surfaced again with 2015’s The Hard Problem, his first theatre script for nine years and still his most recent. Focusing on the nature of consciousness (the “hard problem” of the title), the plotline harked back to Jumpers, with a dash of Dawkins: a young psychology researcher struggles to reconcile her private faith with the chilly rationalism of colleagues in the brain institute where she works. Yet there was a sense that the finished work didn’t altogether add up. Michael Billington thought it occasionally suffered “information overload”, while the Telegraph’s Dominic Cavendish dubbed it a “major disappointment”. Did the reviews get to him? “Not the way they would have done years ago, not at all. I got up in the morning, read them, thought, ‘Oh, that’s a shame’. But then other reviews began coming and some of them were fine. I ended up thinking, ‘Well, we didn’t quite bring that off, I’d better think about that.’” Some suggested that the real, behind-the-scenes problem was he’d been suffering from writer’s block. Was that how it felt? He looks briefly irked. Not at all: part of the reason The Hard Problem took so long was that he’d simultaneously been tackling a multi-part BBC/HBO adaptation of Parade’s End by Ford Madox Ford. Does he have any regrets about devoting time to his TV and movie work? “None,” he replies briskly. “Parade’s End gave me a lot of pleasure. What can you say: the cast was wonderful and 2 million people probably watched it – cheerio, I was glad I did that. But, yes, it was the main reason I didn’t write a play three years earlier.”\\nHe has often spoken of his struggles with pinning down subject matter, quite apart from the exhaustive research he feels compelled to do (he spent three years on The Invention of Love before he wrote a word). When I ask if it’s got any easier, he chuckles ruefully. “No, but of course the whole conversation is self-serving and misleading because I create my own conditions; no one is forcing me to spend half my morning reading the Times Literary Supplement and the New York Review of Books and the Spectator and the New Statesman and Prospect. It’s a wonder I’ve written anything for years.” But is he on the lookout for material? “Oh yes. I like to think that something is marinating. I read out of a combination of normal interest and the hope that there will be a play in there, or the half-notion of a play.” The question, of course, is what. There were rumours of a project about journalism, a sort of post-Leveson inquiry follow-up to his 1978 play Night and Day. I wonder, too, what he might make of Brexit. He has considered both subjects, he replies; both might be possible – perhaps neither. He sighs. “The big stories at the moment are so big and affect so many people that it’s hard to think which artform could encompass them. Take Brexit: there are so many things begging to be thought about and written about, and I’m not even sure that’s a healthy way to approach the whole matter. If I were a maker of TV documentaries or long-form journalism, maybe I’d be better placed. I feel a bit puny, really.” I wonder what he really feels about Brexit, as someone born in Czechoslovakia who spent his first years in Singapore and India before arriving in Britain as a child. Slightly to my surprise, he hedges his bets. “I have a temperamental attitude which is to be a Remainer, but I don’t pretend to have the knowledge of economics and statistics and whatever is going on in learned journals. I don’t feel equipped to make a Whitehall judgment.” He is less interested by the overall question of whether it’ll be good or bad for British interests than what it means for our character as a nation. “I feel temperamentally that fraternity and sorority is good for us.” Politics interests him as a subject, he adds, but he doesn’t always know where to place himself in terms of left and right. “I feel a bit sheepish about it, but I’m not politically engaged enough to have a political position.” In the meantime there is yet another deadline: that 80th birthday in July. When I say he doesn’t look his age, he’s gratified. “For me to be 80 feels like some sort of contradiction of what I think I am. Apart from my knees, I’m OK. I’m not too 80.”\\nHe’s still smoking? He grins. “Yes, but I’ve got nothing intelligent to say that justifies my position. I don’t have one. I just smoke.” Worries about work rate aside – one suspects they have been there as long as he’s been working – Stoppard seems somehow at peace. In 2014 he married the heiress Sabrina Guinness, his third wife, and now lives in Dorset, far from the London theatre scrum – “at least when I’m there,” he laughs, “which hasn’t been much lately”. He drifts back to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and the play’s obsession with chance, certainties and uncertainties. A line has been haunting him recently, a stray remark by one of the Players that “life is a gamble, at terrible odds – if it was a bet you wouldn’t take it”. It’s a smart observation, but flawed in one regard, he says: occasionally you do win. “I’m sitting in a room talking about rehearsing a play which was first on 50 years ago. Who would have taken a gamble on that?” • Travesties is at the Apollo, London W1, 15 Februaryto 29 April. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is at the Old Vic, London SE1, 25 February to 29 April.', 'One of the curiosities of the long rise of Ukip is that the party that wraps itself in the union flag, and invokes a cartoonish version of Britishness, seems to have such\\xa0a limited understanding of Britain and its institutions. A ruling last week by three judges that parliament is sovereign and must scrutinise and authorise the triggering of article 50 to begin the process of the UK leaving the European Union should have been a cause for Eurosceptic celebration. The judges listened to legal arguments and, citing precedent, explained very clearly and carefully why parliament is sovereign in these matters and must pass an act to begin Brexit. Nigel Farage was furious at this supposed incursion. He said that he had a “feeling” (ah, one of his feelings) that “betrayal is near”. Farage in full flow talks in almost mystical terms, as if he has some form of extrasensory perception that provides him with a unique insight into the course of national affairs and the tide of opinion. Having had such an enormous influence on shaping recent history, perhaps the trainee demagogue has started to fall for his own hype? The establishment, Farage said, is plotting to overturn the result of the referendum and betray the nation. There are certainly a few people trying – mistakenly and pointlessly – to reverse Brexit, but they are not running the government and do not have the numbers in the House of Commons or the country. Brexit will happen, as sensible pro-Remain MPs acknowledge. The question is in what form exactly. In that context, Farage’s rabblerousing is deeply dangerous, because it creates the false impression that Britain will be blocked from leaving the EU, locked in by dastardly, dark forces.His betrayal narrative has echoes of November 1918 in Germany. Immediately after the country had lost the First World War fair and square, the nationalistic right said that the army had been betrayed by the wicked politicians of the establishment who had sued for peace. In that vein, it cannot be long before a leading figure from Ukip warns of “the stab in the back”, a phrase heavy with Germanic historical import from the same era. Farage’s dangerous reaction demonstrates again that the party he built has more in common with continental populist parties and the wilder fringe movements on the right and left than it does with the British tradition of parliamentary democracy and respect for institutions. Farage is a Poujadiste, in the mould of the infamous French politician who channelled the anger of small-town France. But it is not just Ukip that has lost touch with the constitutional fundamentals. Other parts of the broad Brexit movement – some Tory MPs and the Eurosceptic press – have also reacted as if the article 50 decision constitutes a judicial coup against the Brexit vote. A full-blown constitutional crisis is underway, apparently, with parliament supposedly pitched against the people. Some of the more vocal Brexiters in the Tory parliamentary party have indulged this idea, illustrating what happens when campaigners become too hooked on runaway populism. Fresh from undermining the governor of the Bank of England, they are now on to the judiciary. Is there any part of the British system, which theoretically they are dedicated to defending, they won’t attack in lurid terms? Is even the Queen safe? Everyone needs to calm down. The anger against the judges would be justified if they had declared the EU referendum invalid and banned Brexit. They did no such thing. They simply confirmed that parliament should have its proper place in the Brexit process. Of course it should. It is not even as if the judges in this case have been particularly “activist”, which has been a problem in recent decades, with some judges pushing the interpretation of the law in a direction in tune with their thinking or trends in European law. Here – in the article 50 case – they took a thoroughly traditional and praiseworthy pro-parliament approach. For this, they were branded “unelected”, which is unintentionally revealing. The charge that judges being unelected equates to illegitimacy is yet more crazy populist talk. We do not elect judges and for good reason. Centuries of constitutional development and experimentation produced a system, compromised and weakened by EU membership, in which the judiciary is independent. Parliament makes the laws and the courts interpret the law and make judgments. Of course, we could try electing judges, or ordering judges to disregard and ignore the rule of law on the order of politicians, but the international historical precedents do not suggest it ever ends well. As someone who voted to leave the European Union, I simply cannot see the problem with the courts and parliament doing their respective jobs properly. Indeed, nothing could be more in tune with the vote to leave the European Union than three judges applying the law and declaring that parliament must give the go-ahead for article 50.\\nBut it is important to understand the limits of what the court decided and what parliament can reasonably do next. It is not a mandate to stop the UK leaving the EU. Those who think it is are the mirror image of the hardline Brexiters. Those equally hardline Remainers who refuse to accept that they lost the referendum and want it set aside mount attacks that are almost as frenzied as those of the Faragists. If the Remainiacs – and some are behaving like Jacobites – are not calling Leave voters stupid, they are the next moment branding them gullible, which is just a nicer way of saying stupid. But neither set of extremists is representative of, nor has a majority in, parliament or the country. What becomes ever more apparent over Brexit is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate (of which there are many) Leavers and moderate Remainers, those who regret the result on 23 June but accept it. If – if – a deal can be done after two years of talks with the EU, it will involve a degree of compromise, which again is supposed to be a British trait. If there is no bespoke British deal to be done, because the EU refuses, it will be hardish Brexit time. The chances of the former rather than the latter outcome being the result are greatly enhanced by moderate Leavers and Remainers co-operating. If you voted Remain and want to avoid a hard Brexit, organise for compromise. In terms of immediate next steps and article 50, the Commons wants assurances that the government has reasonable, achievable aims in its negotiations. There is not an appetite for blocking the process. The situation is more complicated in the House of Lords, but even there peers must know that an early election (achievable by the government voting itself out of office) would see Theresa May returned with a landslide majority for triggering article 50 and a mandate to get on with it. It may not come to that, although the government has not helped calm the situation by rushing to appeal to the supreme court. Theresa May would have done better by calmly accepting the outcome and saying that it illustrated the soundness of a British system that rests on the independence of the judiciary, government accountability to parliament and representative parliamentary democracy. That is what leaving the EU was at root supposed to be about, surely.', 'At the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), we have worked with London Economics and Kaplan International on the most detailed and sophisticated econometric modelling yet undertaken on how Brexit will affect universities. The results confirm that our departure from the European Union will be messy and difficult – but perhaps not as bad as feared in many respects. It is also likely to affect different universities in different ways. Universities had a shock on 23 June – students and academics largely voted to remain. In truth, the on-campus consensus was a little stifling, perhaps even counterproductive. Had the arguments for staying in been crafted in the cut-and-thrust of fierce and open debate, they might have been more persuasive; less focused on cash and more on the benefits of collaboration across borders. I saw this first-hand on my weekly visits to universities. Last year, I paid three visits to the University of Derby – before, close to and after the referendum. They have campuses across one of the most beautiful of English counties, in Buxton, Chesterfield and Derby itself, and strong links to local exporters such as Rolls-Royce, Toyota and Bombardier. The expectation was for a big remain vote. Yet every part of Derbyshire voted to leave on a big turnout. Universities have responded to the new reality in two ways. First, by thinking about how they engage with their local communities. Bill Rammell, a previous minister for higher education and now vice-chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire, says the referendum result places “a real and significant burden on universities to take a more substantial role in civil society, rebuilding public trust through active engagement”. ‘There was no planning for Brexit’ The second part of the response is more parochial. It involves assessing what Brexit means for each university’s income and student enrolment. That is harder than it sounds because universities are in the same position as Whitehall: there was no planning for Brexit. While David Cameron was barring civil servants from contingency preparations, Universities UK concentrated on establishing a pro-EU campaign platform called Universities for Europe. Of course the number of EU citizens who come to UK universities will probably fall as a result of Brexit. In part, this is because they are likely to lose access to tuition fee loans and to face full international fees, which are much higher than the UK fees they have been paying. Any fall is regrettable and, sadly, the latest Ucas figures suggest it has already begun. But working out how big the drop-off will be is hard partly because it depends on the type, location and mix of students at each university. Our assessment of Brexit’s impact takes such factors into account and finds the effect on student numbers and university incomes could be less dramatic than expected. There are almost three times as many foreign students in the UK from outside the EU as from within it. This is because, until recently, EU undergraduate students came within the student number controls imposed on universities. So there was limited incentive to recruit them. Our analysis shows that, overall, their numbers could fall by more than half – that is by over 31,000 new students each year. But that is still only about 3% of all first-year undergraduate and postgraduate enrolments. Moreover, because of the higher fees, our modelling suggests that, despite receiving 31,000 fewer new EU students, universities will only lose £40m a year in the first year. That is just 0.1% of the total income of publicly-funded higher education institutions across the UK. Some institutions, such as Oxford and Cambridge, will actually see their fee income rise even as their EU students fall. This is because their full international fees are so high. Even that is not the complete picture, because Brexit has led to a depreciation in the value of the pound. That makes studying in the UK cheaper for those outside the EU. Our analysis suggests that the number of non-EU students arriving to study in the UK could increase by 20,000 in the first year, thereby offsetting two-thirds of the fall in students from the EU. Assuming that this is right, the income from these additional students’ tuition fees could total £227m in their first year alone – much more than offsetting the financial loss from welcoming fewer EU students. A tale of two camps None of this is guaranteed to happen. At last year’s Conservative party conference, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, promised “tougher rules” to reduce the number of students from overseas. If she were to bar those 20,000 new international students from coming to the UK, the total loss to the economy could eventually total £2bn a year. The loss would be split roughly equally between lost direct spending by international students (on fees, accommodation and living costs) and lost knock-on benefits for universities’ supply chains. The academics and students who voted remain now tend to fall in one of two camps. Some do not accept the referendum result and think everything possible should be done to reverse it. Others think new opportunities have to be uncovered and used. Even Universities UK now says that “universities can thrive outside the European Union”. They can. But only if the government lets them.

In a hearing at the high court that lasted less than an hour, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Lewis dismissed an application for a fresh judicial review of the Brexit process brought by two sets of claimants. Parliament is in the process of giving the government its approval to trigger Brexit under article 50 of the Lisbon treaty following a historic legal action in the supreme court over parliamentary sovereignty. Giving their reasons for turning down the judicial review application, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones said: “In our judgment these present claims are premature. The relevant situations against which the claims might be assessed have not yet occurred.” Adrian Yalland and Peter Wilding, who brought the challenge, said the decision meant that they may be able to bring their challenge over article 127 at a later date. In a joint statement, they said the ruling “left the door firmly ajar for future proceedings should the government not resolve this issue”. They added: “Were it not for us bringing this action, the government would never have addressed this issue. We were right to bring this challenge and unless the government gives business and the country the certainty it needs and deserves, it is highly likely we will be here again.” James Eadie QC, for the government, told the hearing that since ministers had not yet decided which legal route would be taken to leave the EEA, the challenge was “premature” and should be rejected. George Peretz QC, for the lead claimants, told the court that the government’s failure to specify what legal mechanism it would use for quitting the EEA was in danger of creating “profound legal uncertainty and chaos”. The European court of justice in Luxembourg, which decides EU law, may need to be consulted to resolve the confusion over how the UK “disentangles” itself from other European states, George Peretz QC said. The government partially resisted the judicial review application on the grounds that no decision about how to leave the EEA had yet been made and that it was therefore not a decision that was open to challenge. The new case revolved around article 127 of the European Economic Area treaty, which states: “Each contracting party may withdraw from this agreement provided it gives at least 12 months’ notice in writing to the other contracting parties.” The challenge was brought by Yalland and Wilding, who runs the pro-single market organisation British Influence. Wilding is credited with inventing the term Brexit in 2012. Peretz maintained that the prime minister, Theresa May, had already announced that the UK would be leaving the EEA and the single market. What is in dispute is the legality of the various mechanisms for quitting the EEA. The government has not yet decided which route it will take. If the government chooses to use article 127 of the EEA treaty, Peretz said, then an act would be required in parliament in the same way that a bill triggering article 50 of the European Union treaty is now going through parliament. The government has also argued that when the UK leaves the EU it will automatically at the same time leave the EEA. Alternatively, a conference of all the member states of the EEA could be called to renegotiate a new relationship. A government spokesperson said: “We are glad this attempt to seek a judicial review has been dismissed. As the prime minister has said, we will not be a member of the single market and we will be seeking a broad new partnership with the EU including a bold and ambitious free trade agreement.” • This article was amended on 4 February 2017. An earlier version said parliament had given the government its approval to trigger Article 50. It is in the process of doing so.', 'The government’s Brexit strategy faces a fresh legal challenge in the high court on Friday when campaigners argue that parliament must separately legislate to remove the UK from the European Economic Area (EEA) and the single market. After months of resisting – and ultimately losing – a series of courtroom battles over ministers’ use of their executive powers to trigger article 50 and leave the EU, government lawyers may be forced to launch a renewed defence of the royal prerogative. The government is partially resisting the judicial review application on the grounds that no decision about how to leave the EEA has yet been made and that it is therefore not a decision that is open to challenge. The new case revolves around article 127 of the EEA treaty, which states : “Each contracting party may withdraw from this agreement provided it gives at least 12 months’ notice in writing to the other contracting parties.” The challenge has been brought by Adrian Yalland and Peter Wilding, who runs the pro-single market organisation British Influence. Wilding is the man credited with inventing the term Brexit in 2012. They have been joined by a second set of claimants who have been identified only by the letters W, L, T and B. The second group of claimants say they do not want to be named for fear of being targeted by the type of abuse and threats that have been directed at Gina Miller, the lead claimant in the article 50 case at the supreme court. The unnamed applicants have various nationalities and have brought the action in order to highlight the “state of limbo” into which they believe they will fall following UK withdrawal from the EU. The European Economic Area Act 1993, their lawyers argue, established EEA rights in UK domestic law. Lawyers for both groups believe that parliament must authorise a separate departure process from the one it has begun for article 50 of the EU treaty. Yalland, a political lobbyist and founder of the Single Market Justice Campaign, said: “I have campaigned for parliamentary sovereignty and accountable government for 20 years and now I want parliament to exercise its sovereignty by deciding if the UK should withdraw from the single market treaty. “Parliament, not government, took us into the treaty and so parliament, not government, must decide if and when we leave. I voted to leave the EU but parliament did not intend the referendum to cover the issue of membership of the EEA. The government should stop seeking to stretch the mandate to leave the EU to cover things parliament did not intend the referendum to cover. “The referendum was on membership of the EU, not the EEA, nor of [the European court of human rights]. It was not an opinion poll on immigration. I want nothing less than Brexit. But anything more than Brexit is for parliament to permit. The government has a mandate, not a blank cheque. We are a parliamentary democracy, not an elected dictatorship.” Yalland said a hard Brexit would risk detaching Scotland from the UK. He added: “An independent Scotland may be unlikely to join the EU, but it is a credible candidate for EFTA [European Free Trade Association] membership – which would give it full membership of the single market.” Responding to the case last month, a government spokesman said: “The UK is party to the EEA agreement only in its capacity as an EU member state. Once the UK leaves the EU, the EEA agreement will automatically cease to apply to the UK.” Commenting on the EEA case, David Golten, head of commercial litigation at the law firm Wedlake Bell, said: “Most people have never heard of article 127 – the trigger to leaving the European Economic Area – but it is article 50’s bigger and uglier brother … To remain or not in the single market is now the field of battle. “The remainers and the soft Brexiteers will join forces. There may have to be a general election. Those who lost the argument on membership of the EU will fight tooth and claw to keep us in the single market.”', 'The government’s much anticipated white paper on Brexit tells the country nothing and everything about the most important foreign policy decision to face Britain for decades. Most of what is in its 77-pages is a souped up version of Theresa May’s speech last month. It retails the idea that a trade deal could be swiftly done which grants the UK all the benefits of EU membership with few of the costs. The white paper is so full of platitudes and empty rhetoric that it contains a passage that states Britain in Europe remained sovereign, but it did not always feel that way. That might call for national therapy sessions rather than the electroshock treatment prescribed by Brexit. Contained within the document is a bigger truth: that government is engaging in a troubling form of politics, where ministers can pursue their interest without compromise. The executive has revealed nothing but contempt for institutional parliamentary forms. The white paper offers no scrutiny, no mechanisms to hold ministers to account, no ways of influencing the Brexit process. Such is the dizzying madness of these times that parliamentarians quote, to knowing laughs, from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland. Another line from that book that comes to mind is “here it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place”. Next week MPs get a chance to amend the bill to trigger article 50. It’s a parliamentary affair that to some extent is choreography. The mood music suggests that rebels will get to tango a little. Ministers, it is said, will give assurances over European Union citizens’ right to stay in Britain. Another distinct possibility is that ministers will return, at a time that suits them, to the Commons to update MPs on Brexit negotiations. What the government seeks to avoid is a confrontation in which Tory rebels find common cause with Labour. In this ministers are lucky in having a Labour party that is depressingly dissolving into squabbling factions. The party leadership says it will not block article 50. That means little: this week shadow cabinet ministers voted against the whip but were not sacked. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary and leadership loyalist, didn’t turn up for the key vote, saying she was ill. The party’s chief whip plainly has no authority in the parliamentary party – he can hardly discipline MPs, let alone his own whips who voted against Labour’s leadership. Three times now Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn on three key issues – Syria, Trident and Brexit – has been unable to get his troops behind him. To\\xa0be fair, cutting the gordian knot of Brexit would involve devising a parliamentary strategy that can satisfy simultaneously remain Labour voters in the big cities and leave Labour voters in the north. Labour has to go beyond the standard repertoire of arguments, which comes across as nothing but an apology for the status quo. For this the party needs a new moral language about Britain’s departure from Europe. Mr Corbyn should recall the sage advice of cricket legend David Gower, who noted: “You can make plans, but if the opposition plays well, then all your plans become worthless.” This may be beyond Mr Corbyn or it may suit his own political position. At the moment Mr Corbyn has ended up backing Mrs May’s position of exiting Europe by leaving the single market. He differs only that he appears to be more welcoming to immigrants than she is. If Mr Corbyn is still above the fray, but not in it next week, then he risks obsolescence. The leaderless revolt over the bill will grow on Labour’s benches. There are many Labour MPs, like the shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, who threaten to rebel if the proposed amendments – to hold the government to account for Brexit’s economic vandalism – do not satisfy them. Britain’s departure from the EU is being driven by what Labour’s Angela Eagle correctly describes as the “most hallucinatory of the Eurosceptic nostalgics in the Tory party (who) dream of a frictionless divorce with no real consequences”. Mrs May is in thrall to her own headbangers. That is why the white paper talks about a vote on the terms of a final Brexit deal but leaves open the question: what if there is no deal? This allows Tory Brexiters to indulge the magical thinking of a Britain unchained from Europe by a hard Brexit. The government peddles the\\xa0fantasy of a tax haven, regulation-lite British lion prowling global markets. It’s a delusion encouraged by ministers who suggest Europe is secretly terrified of dealing with such a beast. Labour and Tory rebels should not fall for this circus – and should profitably join hands over the issue. Else they face endorsing a disaster brought about by government distraction and hubris.', 'Comprehensive customs and border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland are not remotely possible, the Irish ambassador to the UK has said, predicting the EU will recognise the unique nature of the border when Brexit causes the UK to leave both the single market and customs union. Theresa May dealt a blow to Ireland in her Brexit white paper when she said she wanted in effect to leave the EU customs union, confirming Brexit poses a huge threat to frictionless cross-border trade on the island of Ireland, the mainstay of the Irish economy.\\nBut giving evidence to the Northern Ireland select committee, Daniel Mulhall said there were signs that Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, would recognise that the issue of UK-Irish cross-border trade had to be treated as a special local case. He welcomed Barnier’s suggestion that the Irish border issue be addressed upfront in the coming talks, rather than included in wider horse trading at the end. But he acknowledged the UK and Ireland would not be able legally to negotiate a bilateral customs deal. His admission that physical border checks are impossible puts the onus on the EU showing flexibility, or developing technology to check goods to see if duties are payable. The EU is caught in a bind of needing to protect the integrity of the single market and customs union, yet prevent a new regime of a hard border and heavy customs checks in Northern Ireland. Some legal experts have said such a special deal is legally inconceivable, and the Irish government is being over-optimistic that it can prevent a potentially damaging blow to its economy. Pointing to the scale of required border checks, Mulhall said that at present there were more than 200 crossing points on the borders, with 177,000 lorries crossing a month, 208,000 vans and 1.85m cars. He said: “I don’t think it is even remotely possible to think in terms of having a border that would really control every movement of goods and people across that border. This is a border that is invisible. It is different from most other borders that our European partners might be familiar with.” The UK’s decision to be outside the EU common external tariff is raising logistical nightmares since, in theory, the border could become a back door for smuggling and trading. The UK has been looking at solutions, such as joint border checks with Ireland or greater use of technology to undertake automatic border customs checks. Mulhall said many options were being studied. Mulhall argued the UK-Ireland border was unique in the EU since no product could subsequently enter the EU except through the Channel tunnel, by air or across the sea. Mulhall said there was a need to be creative and make allowances to accommodate the unique situation. But he insisted he had not got the impression his diplomatic colleagues were “trying to put a spanner in the works and make life difficult for Ireland”.\\nHe also insisted retaining a common travel area would not blow a hole in the border controls of the EU or the UK. He argued there would be no motive for EU citizens to try to infiltrate the UK labour market via Ireland, undermining UK border controls, since they would be unable to work legally in the UK. They would find it easier and cheaper to get into the UK directly via Stansted. It would be “complete anathema” and “a turning back of the clock” to have controls on the free movement of people across the border. He said: “I do not underestimate the difficulties because it has never been done before and it is extremely complex to reconcile 27 views. There is always potential for things to go awry.” But he wanted to scotch the idea that the EU sought to punish the UK for its aberrant behaviour. Both the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and May have expressed confidence that the common travel area between Britain and Ireland will survive unchanged after Brexit but warned of “very negative consequences” if there was a return to a hard border with Northern Ireland. The prime minister has also promised the border will be as seamless and frictionless as possible.', 'Usually, when it comes up in the Brexit debate, freedom of movement relates to the passage of human beings. Usually, but not always. Britain’s decision to leave the EU also threatens the free movement of horses, potentially dealing a blow to the racing community in the UK and Ireland, industry experts and an MEP have said.\\nA tripartite agreement between the UK, France and the Republic of Ireland allows thoroughbred horses to travel freely between those countries for races. Under an EU directive, the horses need only to have an EU passport and be on a livestock database. They do not require a veterinary export health certification or customs documentation. Such are the concerns about the future of the arrangement that “Brexit’s potential impact on the horse industry” will be the lead subject for discussion at the National Equine Forum in London in March. The UK has signalled its intention to leave both the single market and the customs union, although Theresa May has expressed a desire for “frictionless borders”. Lucy Greayer, a shipping agent, said the racing industry was in the dark over the future. “The current agreement between Ireland, the UK and France means that horses can move around freely without health documentation or anything like that. But if you go further afield, to Germany or Italy, you have to have a certificate from a vet saying they have seen the animal in the last 48 hours and it is fit to travel. “We don’t know what is going to happen. I have horses going to St Moritz in Switzerland. We are having to get a carnet [a document to clear customs]. And that costs a lot of money, hundreds of pounds. It’s perfectly possible that there could be more restrictions going to France. We have more horses going to France than horses coming the other way,” she said. “We just don’t know what is going to happen when Brexit comes into effect. Maybe every time John Gosden or Sir Michael Stoute want to send a horse to France they have to get them a carnet. It costs money and it takes time because you have to go to the chamber of commerce to get it.”\\nMairead McGuinness, an MEP for the Midlands–North-West constituency in Ireland, said she was concerned about the potential blow to the industry, which is worth €1.3bn a year to the Republic. “Uncertainty about so many issues around Brexit extends to the movement of live animals – domestic pets, farm animals and of course, horses. The EU facilitates the movement of horses between member states,” she said. “What will happen when the UK leaves the EU is totally uncertain. How the important business between Ireland and the UK will be impacted is unknown, but there will be consequences and thoroughbred breeders are aware of the threat. “This is adding to uncertainty in the sector as it tries to navigate the unknown. Border controls, disease controls etc are possible outcomes, disrupting the normal movement of horses for racing and breeding between Ireland and the UK. Currency fluctuations are an immediate risk but the real concern is that the situation as it operates today will remain in place – but can it?” McGuinness added: “If Brexit means borders – what then? And if the UK moves away from the EU regulatory regime on diseases controls, animal welfare and animal transport, this too could have negative consequences. I am not sure if anyone is betting on the outcome.” Will Lambe, director of corporate affairs at the British Horseracing Authority, said he had made representations to the government that they need to protect the industry during the coming negotiations. “The tripartite agreement pre-dates the formation of the European Union and there is no reason it should not remain in place following Brexit,” he said. “As we have emphasised to the UK government, the continuation of the free movement of horses between the UK and Ireland is vital to both countries’ racing and breeding industries, which have a significant economic impact and generate considerable international trade.”', 'Rolls-Royce will report one of the biggest losses in British corporate history this week as Brexit and a corruption scandal leave an indelible mark on the famous aerospace company. City analysts have forecast that Rolls could report a pre-tax loss of more than £4bn – its worst ever – due to the sharp decline in the value of the pound and the £671m penalty that the company has agreed to pay to settle corruption allegations. Accounting rules mean Rolls will be forced to write down the value of its currency hedges to reflect sterling’s slump. The pound has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June. Rolls hedges billions of pounds of cash to protect itself against currency fluctuations because deals in the aerospace industry are conducted in dollars. The financial results will also recognise the impact of the £671m penalty that Rolls agreed with authorities in the UK, US and Brazil to settle corruption charges. Although Rolls will make the payment over five years – with £293m expected to be paid in the first year – it is likely to recognise the full cost in the latest accounts as an impairment charge. The pre-tax loss will be the biggest in the history of Rolls, although it is a non-cash loss that reflects a change in the value of assets in its accounts rather than cash actually leaving the business. The biggest loss in British history is the £24bn recorded by Royal Bank of Scotland for 2008. RBS reported another £8.3bn loss for 2013, while Vodafone reported a £22bn loss in 2006 and a £13.5bn loss in 2002. Other milestones include a £8.5bn loss for HBOS in 2008 after it was bought by Lloyds, £6.5bn for Cable & Wireless in 2003, Tesco’s £6.4bn in 2015, and £4.5bn for BP last year. Warren East, Rolls’s chief executive, will face questions about the corruption scandal when he presents the results, such as how it was allowed to happen, what has been done to ensure it does not happen again, and whether the company could lose contracts due to the damage to its reputation. He has already apologised and called the behaviour that was uncovered “completely unacceptable”. However, an industry source said he was prepared to “address the issue front and centre and not shy away from it”. Rolls agreed to the settlement over allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013 to win contracts. Sir Brian Leveson, who approved the so-called deferred prosecution in court, said the SFO’s investigation into Rolls had revealed “the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption” and that some of the charges “implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company”. However, the judge praised the co-operation of the company’s existing management, which allowed Rolls to settle with the SFO rather than face a damaging criminal trial.\\nDespite the penalty and the record loss, East is likely to be in a positive mood when he presents the results. This is because the underlying performance of Rolls is gradually improving. The company has already told shareholders that it enjoyed a “good finish” to the year, with underlying profit – which excludes the impact of sterling’s decline and the SFO penalty – ahead of expectations. The consensus in the City is that underlying profits in 2016 were £687m, down from £1.4bn in 2015. However, they are predicting a rise back to £861m this year. East has been trying to overhaul the engine-maker since replacing John Rishton as chief executive in 2015. He inherited a company that was struggling after a long run of success. Revenues were falling for the first time in a decade and underlying profits were down, prompting East to cut the dividend payout for shareholders for the first time in 24 years in 2016. Rolls, which makes engines for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus’s A380 superjumbos among others, has been affected by lower-than expected demand for the wide-bodied airliners to which it supplies engines. But it has also been hurt by cuts to defence spending and the decline in the oil price, which has lowered demand from the offshore oil and gas industry for its marine products. A year ago, in a sign of the pressure on the company, Rolls was forced to appoint the chief operating officer of ValueAct to its board after the US activist investor built up a stake and called for change. Since then however, Bradley Singer, ValueAct’s representative, has stayed quiet, publicly at least. Meanwhile, East has focused on making Rolls more efficient and accelerating the pace at which it builds engines. He has cut hundreds of middle and senior managers and by the end of 2017 wants to have cut £200m of annual costs. The Rolls boss has effectively backed the company’s technology – and its pipeline of future development – but wants it to be a better manufacturer. Howard Wheeldon, a veteran defence and aerospace analysts, said that East had “taken the bulls by the horns”. He said: “Rolls was paying the price for making a few mistakes in the past. They did not focus on efficiency. They are now, but they didn’t. They allowed the company to become middle-heavy, and top-heavy actually.” The settlement with the SFO ends a four-year probe – although individuals linked to allegations are still being investigated – and Wheeldon said Rolls could now focus on its future. “What happened was a negative, but the positive is that we now have a settlement,” he said. “They can now move on with more clarity than they have in the last four years. They are on course with the plan they set out, but there is still a long, long way to go.”', 'Two more members of the shadow cabinet have resigned, with Rachael Maskell and Dawn Butler quitting the Labour frontbench so they can vote against triggering Brexit. Maskell, the MP for York Central, told Jeremy Corbyn she would leave her role as shadow environment secretary on Wednesday, saying she could not support a “Theresa May Brexit”. It is understood Butler, the MP for Brent Central, has also stepped down as shadow minister for diverse communities.\\nThe resignations are a blow to Labour and its leader after Jo Stevens stepped down as shadow Welsh secretary and Tulip Siddiq gave up a junior frontbench role to vote against the triggering of article 50. There is still speculation that Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, could step down at a later stage in the parliamentary process if the bill is set to pass unamended. Maskell told the Guardian: “I said I would first of all serve my constituents and that is the most important thing for me. Of course it was a difficult decision, as I think it was really important the role I have been playing in providing an alternative way forward for rural Britain. But I also believe it was the right thing to do.\\n“Nobody voted for a Theresa May Brexit. We are coming out of the single market and that was not on the ballot paper. We have an unelected prime minister taking us down on a path people didn’t vote for. I really fear this lack of democracy taking place.”\\nButler tweeted that it had “been an honour to serve in shadow cabinet doing a job I love. Can’t let down future generations voting against poor excuse of a bill”. Corbyn thanked both MPs and described them as “great assets to the Labour party and to our movement”. “MPs have a duty to represent their constituents as well as their party, and I understand the difficulties that MPs for constituencies which voted remain have in relation to the European Union withdrawal bill,” he said. “However, it is right that the Labour party respects the outcome of the referendum on leaving the European Union. We have said all along that Labour will not frustrate the triggering of article 50 and to that end we are asking all MPs to vote for the bill at its second reading tonight.”', 'Theresa May’s attempt to reclaim control of UK borders after Brexit could reduce annual migration from the EU by just 50,000 – one-sixth of the current overall annual figure, according to new research. The projection of a “vanishingly small reduction” is one of the first attempts to estimate how likely labour market demand, and the government’s planned new controls, could reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK. Reduction in immigrant numbers has been repeatedly cited in polls as the chief reason voters backed leaving the European Union. The report by a new thinktank, Global Future, shows total net immigration, which at the latest official estimate was 335,000 in the year to June 2016, could be expected to fall by no more than 15%, to 285,000 a year. Future free trade deals with non-EU countries suggests even this reduction could be wiped out. Liam Fox, the international trade minister, accepted last week he did not know of any new free trade deal that did not also include liberalisation of migration rules between the two countries signing such agreements. Australia and India have already indicated they will seek preferential access for their workers as part of a free trade deal. The government has so far refused to produce its own estimate of the cut in migration from Brexit, or precisely how new controls will operate. But the report’s estimates, which were formulated by breaking down the different elements of net migration from the EU and examining government commitments to retain skilled labour, students and some seasonal work, represents one of most thorough projections to date. The report argues: “While ending freedom of movement is psychologically appealing to those who want a sense of control of our borders, the reality is such a move would create more the illusion of control. People looking for substantial reductions are likely to be disappointed with the eventual figure of 50,000 or less.” The thinktank has won the backing of the Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe, as well as Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. Its director, Gurnek Bains, said: “The extent to which this impact is worth the myriad of economic and political problems that pulling out of free movement would create needs to be reflected upon. In addition, promising more than can be delivered on migration risks creating a firestorm in the future.”\\nFarron said: “In return for this self-inflicted wound it is unlikely that the Conservative Brexit government will be able to deliver its promise of dramatically reduced immigration.” The report starts with the premise that the current true net immigration figure from Europe is 182,700 annually, representing the maximum amount of reduction possible from leaving the EU out of a total immigration figure of 335,000. The estimates suggest net migration of EU students will be unchanged post-Brexit, even though the mix of EU and non-EU students may shift. It also suggests the currently small number of EU citizens coming mainly for family or marriage reasons will remain constant at 25,000. This route will become one of the most attractive way of entering the UK, the report points out. In the biggest category, the number of workers coming in from the EU, the report projects a fall from 204,000 to 125,000, citing government indications that it would have to exempt key professional staff and ensure employers continued to have a ready supply of labour. Even this modest decrease, however, is likely to be offset by EU citizens already in the UK being less likely to leave Britain and the prospect of restrictions on UK citizens moving to other countries in the EU. The report points out 22% of EU migrants are in professional jobs, 22% in skilled occupations and 56% doing unskilled jobs. The UK has already said it will need to keep the professional route open, so the report assumes 50% of existing flow professional workers will still be required. Ministers have also said they will respond to employer pressure to meet their demand for 80,000 seasonal workers, 90% of whom come from the EU. The report then looks at the large proportion of workers in the key industries such as hospitality, transport and building. “Complete closure of the skilled and unskilled categories is simply not feasible without catastrophic consequences for a range of UK sectors,” it warns. The thinktank points out that in its recent Brexit white paper, the government itself also conceded that the supply of skilled and unskilled workers cannot be switched off without serious disruption to key industries. It has promised to work closely with business leaders to ensure adequate supply of labour for key industries. The report also looks at the number of the EU citizens in the UK returning to the EU, saying the number will fall from 95,000 to 58,000, partly due to fears they will be unable to return to the UK. It also expects the current small net outflow of UK citizens to Europe will fall to zero, partly due to changes to residency requirements, access to healthcare and taxation for the estimated 1.2 million UK citizens who live in Europe. Critics will say the thinktank set up to break down cultural barriers has had to make too many assumptions and does not take into account the public’s support for the principle of controlling borders.', 'The government does not have “a blank cheque” to push through its vision of Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn has said, despite the overwhelming Commons vote to pass the article 50 bill without a single amendment. The Labour leader said there was little his party could have done about the bill, given its limited scope, but he would continue to push for concessions and changes as the Brexit process continued. “There was a referendum,” he told BBC1’s Breakfast programme. “There was a decision by the people of this country and we support the result of the referendum, and have to carry it out. “It doesn’t mean we agree with the government on the economy for the future. It does mean we have to build good relations with everybody across Europe.”\\nInsisting the government had already made concessions over both the fact of the article 50 bill and over a parliamentary vote on the final Brexit deal, Corbyn said there was scope to shape the process. “The government does not have a blank cheque to set up an offshore tax haven in Britain,” he said. “All that it has is authority to proceed with negotiations, which is what the referendum was about.” The bill was passed by 494 votes to 122, and will now go to the House of Lords, where Labour and Liberal Democrat peers will press for concessions on key issues including the status of EU citizens living in the UK. Ministers will place significant pressure on peers not to obstruct or amend the bill, even threatening this could otherwise see the end of the upper chamber in its current form. A government source said: “If the Lords don’t want to face an overwhelming public call to be abolished they must get on and protect democracy and pass this bill.” Clive Lewis resigned as shadow business secretary after deciding to go against the three-line whip. He became the fourth shadow cabinet member to step down rather than vote in favour. Corbyn denied there was a crisis in Labour over the issue. “It’s not a disaster,” he said. “The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of a strong message from their own constituents. On all the other votes there is unity, on all the other campaigning there is unity.” Asked about his statement in a tweet that the “real fight” for Brexit starts now, Corbyn argued there was little that could have been achieved with the article 50 bill. “Do you not understand? This was a one-clause bill,” he said. “A one-clause bill that authorised the government to start negotiating, and recognised the result of the referendum.” Corbyn also dismissed reports that he had set a timetable to step down, calling it “fake news”. “I’m really surprised the BBC is reporting fake news,” he said. “There is no news. There is no news.” There was, however, anguish among some Labour MPs about amendments not being passed. Harriet Harman, who had proposed guarantees for overseas EU nationals in the UK, said the failure of this meant these people were being used as “human shields” for Brexit negotiations. “There’s now going to be months if not years of uncertainty; we could have ended that. There’s clear evidence that gangmasters are exploiting people,” she said. Brexit supporters welcomed the bill’s passage through the Commons. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who campaigned for decades for an EU referendum, said: “I never thought I’d see the day where the House of Commons overwhelmingly voted for Britain to leave the European Union.” The Brexit secretary, David Davis, said: “We’ve seen a historic vote tonight – a big majority for getting on with negotiating our exit from the EU and a strong, new partnership with its member states.” Lewis was one of 52 Labour MPs who rebelled against Corbyn’s three-line whip to vote against the legislation, which authorises the government to trigger article 50, the formal process for exiting the EU. Lewis represents Norwich South, a constituency that voted strongly to remain in the EU, and had been openly agonising about whether he could bring himself to support the legislation. In his resignation letter, sent before he voted against the whip on Wednesday, Lewis thanked Corbyn for discussing the issue of Brexit in an “open and comradely way”. But he added: “When I became the MP for Norwich South, I promised my constituents I would be Norwich’s voice in Westminster, not Westminster’s voice in Norwich. I therefore cannot, in all good conscience, vote for something I believe will ultimately harm the city I have the honour to represent, love and call home. “It is therefore with a heavy heart that I have decided to resign from the shadow cabinet.” He said he felt he could not vote for the article 50 bill, since Labour had not succeeded in amending it. “Our party, the Labour party, was right to attempt, through parliament, to win the protections the people of this country need. Unfortunately, despite the progress we did make, we have been unable to secure them,” he wrote. Widely seen as a rising star on the left of the party, Lewis voted for the bill at its second reading last week, but made it clear that if Labour failed to amend the legislation he could not do so again. When the last potential amendment failed on Wednesday night, Labour issued a statement saying he had stepped down. Some see him as a potential leadership candidate, who could act as a bridge between the Corbynite wing of the party and the so-called soft left. But in the corridors MPs were being quite disparaging about what some called his “flip-flopping” in recent days about whether he could back the bill.\\nDiane Abbott, the Hackney North MP who was absent from last week’s second reading, citing a migraine, voted in favour of the bill despite speculation she was concerned about the reaction of her overwhelmingly pro-remain constituents. In her official response to the vote she said that while she accepted the result of the referendum, “this does not mean that we have to accept Brexit in the haphazard way in which it is being handed to us”. She continued: “This passage of this bill has been a challenge for Labour. Our MPs represent the top six most passionately pro-leave constituencies, and the six most passionately pro-remain constituencies … I voted for the bill as a loyal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and a loyal member of the shadow cabinet.” She later said Brexit was not the leftwing idea imagined by Labour stalwart Tony Benn but a situation more akin to the politics of the US president, Donald Trump. She told BBC2’s Newsnight programme: “I respect the result of the referendum and no one wanted to thwart it in a perverse kind of way. But we need to be clear, this is not a Tony Benn Brexit, this is Donald Trump Brexit, and it’s got a very ugly side.” Corbyn will now have to embark on a reshuffle, and must also decide how to treat frontbenchers outside the shadow cabinet, including three of his own whips, who rebelled. Labour sources said decisions would be made in the next few days.', 'The UK could lose 30,000 finance sector jobs as a result of Brexit, but EU rivals need to act to avoid importing banking risk to the continent, according to an influential thinktank with close ties to the European commission. The City of London stands to lose 10,000 banking jobs and 20,000 roles in accountancy, law and consulting, as EU clients move business worth €1.8tn (£1.6tn) to the continent after Brexit, according to Brussels-based Bruegel. According to the economics thinktank’s model, Frankfurt would be the biggest winner, with Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin also making gains. But the researchers warn that having a more geographically diverse spread of financial institutions, without stronger oversight of banks, would heighten the risk of a banking meltdown in the event of an acute financial crisis.\\nThese risks could be reduced and benefits shared more evenly, the authors argue, if the EU takes a common approach to investment banks rather than 27 national systems in a “regulatory race to the bottom” to steal London’s crown. The analysis is based on the assumption the UK will leave the single market, as set out in Theresa May’s Brexit speech last month. “Brexit involves risks for market integrity and stability, because the EU including the UK has been crucially dependent on the Bank of England and the UK Financial Conduct Authority for oversight of its wholesale markets,” states the report. “Without the UK, the the EU27 must swiftly upgrade its capacity to ensure market integrity and financial stability.” Nicolas Véron, a co-author, said the EU faced a mix of risks and opportunity, but had barely started discussing post-Brexit financial regulations. “What is important is for the EU27 to find its feet in the new financial system of the post Brexit landscape,” he said. Rather than creating “27 clones of the FCA and Bank of England”, the EU should instead design “a more centralised consistent architecture”, with central authorities for banking regulation and conduct, Véron added.\\nThe City could be a flashpoint in Britain’s EU exit, given London’s outsized role as Europe’s financial centre. Twice as many euros are traded in London as in the 19 countries of the single currency combined. Bruegel was an early advocate of “banking union” – the eurozone’s shared, but unfinished, system of banking rules – and its reports are closely read within the EU institutions. Véron expressed optimism that the EU would act despite the loss of political momentum that many people expect in 2017 as a result of elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Barring an upset, by October 2017, “governments would be in place, which would create a fairly favourable context for decision-making”, he said.', 'At least 30 Labour MPs are expected to defy the whip by voting against triggering Brexit on Wednesday night, with several frontbenchers still agonising about whether to resign in the coming weeks. The vote will come the day before the government publishes its promised white paper setting out its strategy for withdrawal from the European Union on Thursday. Publication on Thursday was confirmed by Theresa May at prime minister’s questions. Labour rebels will join the 54 SNP MPs, most Liberal Democrats, the SDLP, the Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Tory MP Ken Clarke in an attempt to stop Theresa May invoking article 50 and starting the process of leaving the EU. Among the prominent Labour figures preparing to defy the whip are Maria Eagle, Ben Bradshaw and David Lammy, all former ministers. Jo Stevens and Tulip Siddiq have already resigned from the frontbench in order to vote against Brexit, and there has been speculation about Rachael Maskell, the shadow environment secretary, who said she would make a statement later on Wednesday. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, has said he will vote with the government on Brexit on Wednesday but will not back the two-clause bill next week if Labour fails to secure any amendments to it. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has made it clear it will not be possible for MPs to stay on the frontbench if they defy a three-line whip on the issue. The pro-EU Liberal Democrats are also split, with Norman Lamb, the party’s health spokesman and a former leadership challenger, saying he would abstain. The Conservatives are overwhelmingly in favour of triggering article 50 but a small band of rebels could seek to help those who want to secure extra parliamentary scrutiny through amendments. About 90 MPs are likely to oppose the second reading of the bill, and more could opt to do so at a later stage of the process. On Wednesday morning Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said Labour’s fight to shape Brexit would begin in earnest after article 50 was triggered. “We wanted to stay in the European Union, and we were pretty united around that,” Thornberry said of Labour’s view. “But we lost. The country decided that we should leave the European Union. It was a very serious vote.” The battle now, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, was to persuade May to go for a Brexit that would not damage the UK economy. “The question is: how do we best fight for that? In our view we have to do as instructed and vote to leave the European Union, but actually the fight begins now,” Thornberry said. “Theresa May has put forward a contradictory vision. She has talked about having the fullest possible access to the single market, unimpeded by tariffs and red tape. And we agree with her – that’s the vision we have. “But she also has an alternative vision, where she said that if she didn’t get the deal she wanted, we would be free to set competitive tax rates and … change the basis of Britain’s economic model.” In a letter seen by the Guardian, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has admitted people have urged him to consider resigning to reflect the 75% remain vote in his London constituency, Holborn and St Pancras. While Labour has tabled a series of amendments to the article 50 bill on issues including a meaningful final parliamentary vote over the Brexit deal, a lack of support from pro-remain Conservatives means none are likely to pass. “Let’s see what happens,” Thornberry said when asked about the amendments. “But we will be doing everything that we can to ensure that we get these amendments. “The prime minister does not have a democratic mandate to do whatever she likes with our country. Yes, the public have voted to leave. They have not voted for the contradictory ideas that Theresa May has, and they certainly haven’t voted for her to break the British economic model.” Thornberry confirmed that the three-line whip would remain in place even if no amendments were passed: “We have said consistently, since the result, that we will not frustrate the will of the British people, and they want to leave.” The Brexit bill, forced on the government by a supreme court ruling, triggered a passionate hours-long debate in parliament on Tuesday in which MPs from all parties clashed over the question of Britain’s exit from the EU. Among the MPs voting against the bill will be the former Tory chancellor Clarke. The veteran Conservative delivered an impassioned speech to colleagues on Tuesday about his decision, accusing the Conservative party that he has represented for almost five decades of becoming anti-immigrant. Clarke told colleagues that even his former colleague Enoch Powell, best known for his “Rivers of Blood” speech, would be surprised to see what had become of the Tories. “If he was here he would probably find it amazing to believe that his party had become Eurosceptic and rather mildly anti-immigrant in a strange way in 2016,” he said. “I’m afraid on that I haven’t followed them and I don’t intend to do so.” In his speech, Clarke, a lifelong Europhile, dismissed the “pathetic” arguments of both the leave and remain campaigns in June’s referendum, citing the promise of £350m for the NHS each week and the threat of a post-Brexit punishment budget as among the “dafter” ideas. He also mocked the optimism of Brexit supporters, saying: “Apparently you follow the rabbit down the hole and you emerge in a wonderland where suddenly countries around the world are queuing up to give us trading advantages and access to their markets that previously we had never been able to achieve as part of the European Union. “Nice men like President Trump and President Erdoğan are just impatient to abandon their normal protectionism and give us access.” The Brexit secretary, David Davis, opened the debate by urging MPs to deliver the will of the people. He said the “point of no return” had already passed, adding that there would be “no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it by the back door and no second referendum”. Davis said people were watching to see if politicians would keep their word. “Now we must honour our side of the agreement to vote to deliver on the result. We are considering a very simple question: do we trust the people or not?”', 'Two of the first legal challenges to Brexit have been rejected by a Belfast court. A high court judge ruled that the Good Friday agreement in 1998 could not be used to grant Northern Ireland exemption from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. A victim of loyalist terrorism, Ulster politicians and community groups argued in court that because 56% of the Northern Ireland electorate voted to remain in the EU, the region’s devolved parliament should have the right to vote on staying in Europe. But Mr Justice Paul Maguire dismissed this argument, pointing out that the Good Friday agreement was constitutionally relevant only “in the particular context of whether Northern Ireland should remain as part of the UK or unite with Ireland.” Delivering his judgment in the high court on Friday morning, Mr Justice Maguire said the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland were still unclear after the prime minister indicated she would start negotiations to leave the EU before March 2017.\\n“While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blow cannot yet be determined, so there is a level of uncertainty, as evidenced by the discussion about how the Northern Ireland land border with Ireland was affected by withdrawal from the EU,” he said. Maguire said it was not in the court’s power to overturn a political decision but the judgment in Belfast would not prejudice other challenges to Brexit in English courts. “It is the court’s view the prerogative power is still operative and can be used for the purpose of the executive giving notification for the purpose of article 50. This, however, is said without prejudice to the issues which have been stayed and which are under consideration in the English courts,” the judge said. “In respect of all issues, the court dismissed the applications.” Among those who took the legal challenge to Brexit was Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries. He had argued that Brexit would endanger the peace process and undermine the Good Friday agreement. After the judgment, McCord said he was disappointed, adding that he would take his case to the supreme court in London. ”We live in a democratic system,” he said. “56% of the people of this country voted to remain.” A separate case to grant Northern Ireland the right to be exempt from Brexit was taken by a cross-party group of Stormont assembly members, including Sinn Fein’s former regional education minister John O’Dowd and the former justice minister David Ford. A government spokesperson said: “We welcome the court’s judgment, which agrees with us that the government can proceed to trigger article 50 as planned. “As we have always made clear, we stand by our commitments under the Belfast agreement and the outcome of the EU referendum doesn’t change this. We will now await the outcome of the parallel cases under consideration by the England and Wales high court before setting out our next steps.” The Ulster Unionist party said the judgment in Belfast meant that “the days of Brexiteers and remainers are over”. Stephen Aiken, an Ulster Unionist member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said: “Whether people like it or not, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. “What the people now need is a united front, battling for the best deal possible for Northern Ireland. We would appeal for everyone’s energy to now be dedicated to that cause.”', 'So, that’s a wrap. Here’s how things stand after two more Brexit amendments were voted down before close of play this evening. The government sees off, by 337 noes to 281 ayes, Labour’s NC5 amendment. Similar to Chris Leslie’s attempt earlier in the day, this official Labour Party proposal would force Theresa May to publish any recently conducted Treasury impact statements of EU trading models. Chuka Umunna earlier fought its case when he said the Leave camp’s failure to stay loyal, to the £350m-a-week for the NHS promise, had betrayed referendum voters. The SNP’s amendment was emphatically voted away by 333 noes to 79 ayes. The efforts moved by the party’s Stephen Gethins would force the government to publish an assessment surrounding the UK’s financial risks of leaving the EU before the article 50 card is dealt. The article 50 white paper survives another day unharmed. MPs will resume debating the remaining amendments for the third and final day tomorrow. No one spoke more this evening than the SNP’s Patrick Grady, for a full 58 minutes, and at least one opposition MP accused him of “filibustering”. He was allowed to speak for so long thanks to the shear volume of amendments his party suggested.', 'The debate has now ended for the night after nearly 12 hours of talking. It will continue tomorrow. Here’s a summary of tonight’s speeches: David Lammy, who will be voting against the bill, made one of the evening’s most powerful speeches and quoted both Enoch Powell and Winston Churchill. He said: “[Tories] salivate at the thought of becoming a tax haven like Singapore. But the poorest will be the ones to suffer and many of them are in my constituency.” Caroline Lucas, also made a passionate speech, saying she spoke for all those who continue to be “desperately concerned”. She criticises the way May has moved towards what she calls an extreme Brexit and the way she had dealt with Trump. Another who plans to vote against the bill was Heidi Alexander, who said she had planned to do the opposite until Theresa May’s speech in Lancaster House, which made her feel “ashamed”. Nick Chalk, was one of several Tory MPs who campaigned to remain but will vote for the bill saying that’s what true democrats will do. Ed Vaizey, who was a minister under David Cameron, made one of the most outspoken and angry speeches. The MP railed against the government for sneaking out the announcement that Britain will pull out of the European nuclear research agency Euratom in the notes accompanying the bill without telling any local MPs or the agency’s staff. He’s also “sick and tired” of being branded as unpatriotic and being against the will of the people for wanting parliament to have more of a say in negotiations. Hywel Williams said that businesses are already pulling out of investing in Wales and confidence is low. “We cannot afford the luxury of time and wait to see what deals we can strike,” he stressed. Steve Baker had a warning for if the bill wasn’t passed they would “suffer the kind of political implosion in this country which we can scarcely imagine”. That’s it for tonight. We’ll be back tomorrow so you can follow the rest of the debate ahead of the vote. Thanks so much for joining us today and for all your comments. Sorry I haven’t been able to directly respond.', 'A turbocharged version of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be heading Britain’s way after Theresa May’s Brexit white paper. That’s the upsetting irony for those (and there were a few) who voted to leave the European Union to escape nasty trade deals that involve secret courts to resolve corporate disputes. These are the courts that some of the world’s biggest companies have used when they want to overturn local laws that jeopardise their profits. Tobacco company Philip Morris was a keen exponent. Its legal suits in Australia, Uruguay and others against plain cigarette packaging caused an outcry and cost the respective governments millions of pounds in legal fees, even though it failed. It is a racing certainty that secret courts will be part of any trade deal with the US because even the Obama administration insisted on them. The infamous Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) schemes are part of virtually every existing trade deal and US corporations remain committed to the need for a legal process hidden from view. Donald Trump’s new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, won millions of dollars for ExxonMobil in secret arbitration deals when he was boss of the sprawling energy firm. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has already told Congress that he wants to present other countries with a “take it or leave it” trade model that includes stronger “enforcement mechanisms”, which very plausibly sounds like a more extreme version of the current secret courts system. Peter Navarro, Trump’s chief trade adviser, also looks like he is spoiling for a fight on behalf of corporate America. It was Navarro, an economics professor and close pal of Ross, who hit the headlines last week after he accused Germany, Japan and China of being currency manipulators. In a paper with Ross before the presidential election, he argued strongly for tougher measures on imports to bring down Washington’s ballooning trade deficit. None of this sounds like Britain will get the kind of easy ride promised by international trade minister Liam Fox and his equally naive colleagues Boris Johnson and David Davis. If anything, Fox will be forced to present parliament with a toxic cocktail of arrangements far worse than anything Brussels was prepared to demand. Before the Brexit vote, EU officials reacted to public anger over ISDSs by putting forward a compromise deal. As EU commissioner Frans Timmermans said: “The new Investment Court System [ICS] will be composed of fully qualified judges, proceedings will be transparent, and cases will be decided on the basis of clear rules.” Timmermans and his colleague, the trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström, managed to persuade the Canadians to include this new form of arbitration in the EU/Canada trade deal known as Ceta. But even this will most likely be lost to the UK once it quits the EU. Last week, Fox was due to discuss the impact of Brexit on the Ceta deal.\\nNow Theresa May has decided that Britain is leaving the EU’s single market and customs union on current terms, all the UK’s trade deals via the EU will need to be renegotiated. The hope among Brexiters has always been that the UK can strike a similar or improved compact with the countries covered by existing arrangements. But the Canada deal explicitly recognises that arbitration will be overseen by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The Brexit white paper says the UK will no longer come under the ECJ’s jurisdiction. Once the UK leaves the EU, a new deal is almost certain to revert to the old ISDS system used by Canada, including in the Nafta agreement with Mexico and the US. Fox said there wasn’t enough time to debate the fate of Ceta while the white paper was being discussed. Eagerly, MPs turned to the white paper for an answer. But as Angus Armstrong, a senior director at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research points out, the white paper skirted the issue, even though it is pivotal to how trade disputes are decided in the future. Nick Dearden, director of the campaign group Global Justice Now, said: “There’s every reason to suspect that any UK-US trade deal would involve something equal to, or even worse than, the system of ‘corporate courts’ or ISDS that proved to be so controversial in TTIP.” Like many, Dearden, who advised voters last year against voting for Brexit to escape TTIP, fears a new deal will pave the way for massive US healthcare companies to mount a takeover of NHS services, and that chemically washed American chickens could supplant homegrown alternatives on supermarket shelves. He has every reason to be concerned. While running Exxon, Tillerson launched investment disputes against a number of countries with which the US has treaties, including Venezuela and Argentina. Reports in the Canadian press show he brought a case against the country under Nafta that secured $17m in compensation for having to pay into a provincial research and development fund where Exxon drills for offshore oil. No doubt Britain will suffer the same democratic deficit once Fox bends the knee in Washington.', 'British MPs debated government’s Brexit bill on Tuesday, in an initial two-day debate in the House of Commons.\\nOur readers have been discussing the vote, the speeches of individual MPs on both sides of the debate, and the likely outcome of Wednesday’s vote, which is expected to send the legislation on to its next parliamentary stage.

At the end of the second day of debate, there will be a vote on whether to send the legislation to its next parliamentary stage. 2 February: Theresa May could publish her white paper – setting out the government’s formal policy position on Brexit – as early as Thursday. 6 and 7 February: The bill will begin its committee stage in the Commons, which gives MPs an opportunity for further scrutiny and attempts at revision. They can try to change the bill by pushing through a series of amendments, although it is unlikely any will pass without the support of significant numbers of rebel Tory MPs. 8 February: At the end of the committee stage, MPs will get another chance to debate the bill, followed by a final vote.

Once the bill has received royal assent, May will be able to trigger article 50 at any point thereafter. 9 and 10 March: May could use the occasion of an EU summit in Brussels to formally trigger article 50 and start the two-year countdown to the UK leaving the EU. 31 March: This is the self-imposed deadline set by May for invoking article 50 by notifying the European council of Britain’s intention to leave the EU.', 'Mike Russell, Scotland’s Brexit minister, has accused the UK government of reneging on promises made by leave campaigners that Scotland would gain major new powers after leaving the EU. Speaking during a head-to-head debate with Michael Gove, a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, Russell brandished a leaflet given to Scottish voters by the pro-Brexit group which promised Scotland would automatically win significant new powers after the UK left the EU. In a clear hint this issue could be central to a new Scottish National party independence campaign, Russell said the evidence so far was that the UK government was not following through on that promise. Repeating campaign pledges made by Vote Leave leaders in Scotland before the referendum, the leaflet said: “Scotland will regain control over fishing, agriculture and important social and environmental areas – giving Holyrood even more power to deliver for the Scottish people.” Gove, a co-convenor of Vote Leave whose father once ran a fish processing firm in Aberdeen, admitted he could no longer back up those promises since he was no longer a UK cabinet minister. “There is a number of things if I were a minister I would love to be able to do. What I cannot do is guarantee the transfer of these powers. I have to respect the fact that the UK government is taking a different approach,” Gove told the event. Under the devolution settlement, the Scottish parliament has direct control over core EU policy areas such as fisheries policy and implementing fish quotas, marine conservation, farming subsidies, environmental protection and water quality, and pan-European policing and justice. With Scottish fishermen among the most active and vocal anti-EU campaigners of the referendum, the claim there were clear “Brexit dividends” for Scotland if the UK quit the EU became a key argument for leave campaigners. But Russell, the Scottish government’s lead Brexit negotiator, told a debate organised by the Times on Friday: “Now if that is a promise which was made then it appears this promise is not being honoured. I can tell you there is a very difficult discussion taking place, making little progress, about this question of automatic transfer of powers and frameworks. “So the campaign appears to me to have been perhaps not as straightforward and as honest as it might have been, because that is the position the UK government is taking.” He said Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, had set out all the repatriated powers it believed should come to Edinburgh in its EU policy paper in December. He said those should be examined “with a fine-tooth comb” by the UK government but were being ignored. Fishing industry leaders privately accuse Russell of double standards on repatriating control over fish stocks and quotas since the SNP’s policy is that an independent Scotland would remain in the EU. That would put it back inside the common fisheries policy while Scotland would become one of the EU’s smallest member states, with less negotiating power. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, has confirmed that shifting powers from Brussels directly to Edinburgh is on the table, including justice powers. However no UK minister has committed to any specific policies or spending powers, despite Sturgeon’s threat she could press for a new referendum as early as March, when Theresa May is expected to trigger article 50. UK government sources confirm that Scotland will face bitter turf wars with other Whitehall departments and the Treasury over which government takes control of those powers and spending. The UK government’s white paper on leaving the EU published on Thursday appears to support Russell’s claim. It promised that no powers currently held in Edinburgh would be taken away, but made clear that any new spending and policy-making powers were still to be decided. A spokesman for Mundell said the UK government’s starting point was to ensure nothing interfered with the UK’s internal market but increasing the Scottish parliament’s powers was clearly on the agenda. “We’re approaching the discussions on repatriation with a completely open mind and in a pragmatic way, by looking at where those powers sit best,” he said.', 'Creating a new hour of standup can be a lengthy process. Most comics spend months writing material and honing punchlines. For many, performing a run in Edinburgh is the final goal. For more established names, there’s life after the fringe, with possible London runs and national tours. So what happens when, after months of labouring over an idea, world events derail your plans? On 23 June, Britain voted to leave the EU. Suddenly that seemed far more important to Bridget Christie than the topic she was writing about, so she ripped up her show and started from scratch. I meet Christie in a cafe near her home in Stoke Newington, north London, to talk through the creation of that new show – how every idea was formed, every punchline introduced, all in just a matter of weeks. She sits down, opens her rucksack and pulls out reams of A4 paper – drafts, handwritten set lists and pen-marked notes like handed-back school tests. So let’s start at the beginning. 9 February 2016 It’s deadline day for comedians to submit information about their show for the Edinburgh fringe brochure. The festival doesn’t start until August so many comics will start by picking an ambiguous title and then flesh it out into an hour of standup nearer the time. But Christie has already decided on the theme for her next solo show. Mortal will be its title, and death and mortality will be the big topics. Since 2008’s A Ant – in which Christie used ants as a metaphor for female comedians – the Gloucester-born comic has explored gender politics in increasing depth, including the Edinburgh Comedy award-winning A Bic for Her in 2013. This year, she decides she wants to talk about something more universal. “We all die, it’s something we all have to face,” she says. “I thought: surely there must be a way of making it funny?” Christie became fascinated with death after reading Being Mortal by the surgeon and writer Atul Gawande. The book explores modern medicine’s ability to prolong life while looking at how we confront mortality and care for the elderly and terminally ill. “It’s one of the best books I’ve ever read,” she says 4 April The EU referendum is two months away, and the key campaigning figures and their tactics are dominating the headlines. With the latest polls showing a gain for leave, Christie begins to worry. She’s sitting in her kitchen thinking about Mortal, and looks out at her garden. “I love gardening so much,” she says, “and I particularly adore my fuchsia. I thought: I don’t know if I really want to keep thinking and talking about feminism, politics and death. I might just do a nice show about gardening.” 23 May Christie is performing a 30-minute Edinburgh preview in London at the Leicester Square theatre’s basement studio to an audience of 60. She has one page of written material that lasts about 10 minutes and the rest is improvised. Her method for testing jokes will be familiar to many comics: she marks a tick next to each gag that gets a laugh and a cross next to one that doesn’t, all while she’s on stage. Tonight, she kicks off the gig with an announcement: she’s dying. “Don’t let that affect the way you respond to the show,” she tells the audience. “Don’t laugh out of pity, just because I’m dying. Only laugh if you think I’m funny. Oh yes, when I say I’m dying, I don’t know when, or how, but I will definitely die at some point, probably somewhere towards the end of my life. All of us in this room will. We will all be dead. Anyway …”\\nThe show doesn’t go too well (I count five ticks) and her son’s best friend’s mum was in. “I thought that was a funny opening line,” says Christie, looking back, “but people just didn’t like it. With standup, if you just talk on stage, your clearest ideas come out. But that’s just the idea,” she stresses. “Then you have to make it funny.” She writes constantly, whether at home on a computer or jotting down ideas while out and about. “I never don’t write,” is how she puts it. Different sections require different writing techniques, though. “Some things in a show need to be precisely written,” she explains, “so that the point you’re making is clear. Other things can be more conversational. But it all needs to sound like spoken word, not written.” Christie opens her shows fairly loosely, with a few comments that change each night depending on the venue and audience. But then she sets up the idea for the show and stays more on script. There’s a particular structure and pace to a Christie show. After writing 11 solo hours in as many years, she can get a sense of the show’s shape by looking at it on the page, she tells me. “Everyone works differently and my technique may sound anal and nerdy, but if I laid every page out on the floor, it should look a bit like this: lots of short paragraphs for about four or five pages, then a big bit – which is a stream-of-consciousness thought with no punctuation or sentences – and then more shorter bits towards the end. Some years you don’t find that ‘going off on a tangent’ bit and it always feels like there’s something missing.” 1 June It’s half-term, and Christie is visiting her dad in Gloucester. While talking about the possible referendum outcomes he tells his daughter a story about her mother, who also loved gardening and, like her daughter, was particularly fond of fuchsias. Christie’s Irish mum brought back some soil from her parents’ farm in Ireland, mixed it with the British soil in her garden and grew a fuchsia. It’s a story Christie found very moving. “I thought there might be something in that, for the end of the show.” 24 June The morning after the Brexit vote. The results are in. It’s a shock to many, including Christie. Tonight, she’s meant to be talking about death at London’s Soho theatre. But that now seems irrelevant. “I felt that I couldn’t go out to central London and not talk about what had happened,” she explains. So she types up her Brexit feelings and reads them out on stage that night. “Today is a dark day,” she tells the audience, before examining how Nigel Farage fooled half the UK, comparing him to the blue and black or white and gold dress meme. She expresses her shock and upset at the murder of Jo Cox, and the little impact it had on the polls. She mocks Michael Gove’s comment that people have “had enough of experts”, and his shunning of economists, joking that he must hate numbers so much he probably just takes random amounts of antibiotics rather than the prescribed amount: “Take one four times a day? Says who? Some unelected Brussels bureaucrat? I’ve had enough of numbers. I’ll take as many as I like.”\\nOver the next few days, Christie puts Mortal aside and uses her hastily written thoughts as a starting point for a new post-referendum show entitled Because You Demanded It. Looking back on the notes she wrote that day, it’s incredible to see how many of those ideas ended up in the final show. Sometimes anger feeds creativity. “Death was no longer important,” says Christie. “I thought I should talk about such a seismic political event and, anyway, it’s good to take a risk sometimes. What’s the worst that can happen? You get loads of two-star reviews, no one comes and you lose your income for that year …” 27 June Racing to keep up with referendum repercussions, a BBC reporter interviews a leave voter with a swastika tattoo on his arm, and Christie can’t believe he’s not challenged on it. “I watched it go out live and seem to remember EU fishing quotas being mentioned as one of the reasons the man voted leave,” she recalls, “unless I dreamed that bit. I thought I might be able to do something linking neo-Nazi symbolism and the Icelandic mackerel dispute.” In the final show, the story of this vox pop is broken up into several sections as Christie uses it to detour into other topics and tangential thoughts, all the while returning to the unchallenged racism. “I wanted to talk about media coverage, and how I felt the BBC’s political editors were failing us by not calling out fascism for what it was, but presenting it as a legitimate part of the debate. Then focus on society, and ask: where do you even get a swastika tattoo? Are there specialist white supremacist tattoo parlours or do tattoo artists have the equivalent of the Hippocratic oath? Then eventually it’s about the big conversation: how did we get here?” Over time, the BBC interview becomes one of the backbones of the show, and it provides a neat (and memorable) callback at its conclusion, when Christie takes off her jacket to reveal her arms are covered in felt-tip pen swastikas … and one fish. “Really, the man interviewed wasn’t covered in swastika tattoos, he just had one, but I don’t think we need to worry about exact numbers in the current climate, do we? Numbers are just for economists to patronise the working classes with. And anyway, I think we’d all agree that any more than none swastika tattoos is too many swastika tattoos.”\\n7 July Christie is previewing the show at London’s Always Be Comedy alongside her friend and fellow comedian Nish Kumar. They discuss post-Brexit Britain and the rise in race hate crimes since the result – something Kumar has experienced. On the night after the vote, as he was on stage at the Comedy Store, a heckler told him to “go home”. Kumar encourages Christie to pursue an idea she has about racism and the demonisation of the white working class. The show’s coming together at a rapid pace. 9 July Christie’s newsletter announces that she’s scrapped Mortal and will be doing a new show on Brexit instead. But right now, she’s got other things on her mind. Today, she’s going on holiday with her family. “We go to the same place in France every year, at the same time – after school breaks up and before the fringe” she explains. “It’s where I finished my last three shows. But this year, I forgot about the show. I felt like I needed to clear my mind.” When she returns to the UK, a week before the festival begins, she has about 30 minutes of material, so books in some emergency previews. Her friend, writer and actor Brona C Titley, comes along and they look at the show’s structure together.\\n2 August After frantic rewriting, Christie’s performing a last-minute preview at the Museum of Comedy in London. Many of the show’s big themes are taking shape, but she’s struggling to figure out exactly the significance of her mum’s fuchsia, and how that relates to Brexit. “I couldn’t quite put my finger on it,” she says. “I called Alison Vernon Smith, who produces my radio shows and who is really great at telling me what I mean about things, and we got to the bottom of it.” In a new gardening/Brexit metaphor, immigrants become plants and the UK becomes soil, and from that sprout more gardening-related metaphors about patriotism and the positives of mixing cultures with ours. “It really was lucky that fuchsias were not indigenous to Britain,” she says. 5 August It’s 11am, and the venue in Edinburgh is sold out for Christie’s first show. It’s the time slot-venue combo that’s become Christie’s fringe trademark. “I can’t imagine where else I’d play in Edinburgh now,” she says. “The Stand is a club all year round, so it has a great lived-in atmosphere. It’s the perfect room for standup: low ceilings, a small stage and cabaret-style seating at the front.” During previews audiences have, largely, been split on Brexit. So how does a firm remainer get her opinions across without alienating up to 52% of her punters? It’s about finding the common ground, she says. “Lies were told and promises broken. I don’t think anyone got what they wanted.” Christie thinks about her new fuchsia-metaphor ending and the subject she really wanted to write a show about – her garden – and she has an idea. “I thought, I should be trying to do a show about gardening, but whenever I try to talk about my garden, I get distracted.” The show’s opening takes shape. She jokingly gives the audience the option to leave if Brexit does distract her, and her show becomes a referendum in itself. 11 August It’s more than a week into the festival, and almost two months after the vote. The focus of Brexit is shifting from the dividing campaigns to the terms of our exit, and Christie is determined not to let people forget. “Johnson and Gove behaved like childish twats,” she says. “It was all just a game to them, to further their own careers. It’s really important to remember that.” Christie writes her own “Ladybird Book of Brexit” to read at the end of her show – all the lies and motives and backstabbing – in blunt, simple detail. Add to that the Irish soil story and her tattooed arms, and it’s a powerful finale, and elegantly sums up the anger and absurdity of post-Brexit Britain.\\n29 August It’s the last day of the festival and Christie’s final performance. Over the month, the show has changed by about 25%, she reckons, as she workshopped ideas, honed her thoughts and kept up with the news. The death show isn’t totally dead – she plans to return to the idea at some point – and the odd joke has slipped into the Brexit show, reshaped to fit the narrative. There was a section in Mortal where Christie explained that she wouldn’t lie to her children about death, which she subtly reworked. “I linked it to not lying to them about politics or religion either,” she explains. “It was much longer in Mortal, but I cut it down and used it to connect a routine to my Ladybird Book of Brexit, which I say I wrote for my children.” Largely, though, she has written a new hour of comedy in just a few weeks, and it’s a risk that’s paid off. Because You Demanded It is bold, brave, passionate and playfully absurd. The sheer topicality of the show is impressive. Many comics touched on Brexit during the festival. But Christie really took ownership of the topic, and it was her furious bafflement at the situation that made her show so funny. Her exasperation was genuine and affecting. Critics agreed. Because You Demanded It became one of the most acclaimed shows at the festival, racking up eight five-star reviews. “I didn’t used to read my reviews until I got back from Edinburgh,” says Christie. “I do now, though, only because I’ve done 11 shows in a row, so I’m calmer about them.”\\n29 September It’s a month since the fringe ended, and Christie’s been busy reworking her show. Ahead of a national tour next year, she’s performing Because You Demanded It twice a month in London, so that she can update the material as events unfold. Tonight’s show at the Leicester Square theatre includes new gags about Jeremy Corbyn, Labour and, with the US election edging closer, Trump. “This man ejected a crying baby from a rally,” she says on stage. “And for that reason, Donald Trump should not have the authority to deploy US troops. Not if he’s threatened by a crying baby. I don’t even think the baby was armed, unusually.” Everything is always a work in progress, says Christie. “I don’t think there’s a writer alive who thinks whatever they’ve done is the best it could possibly be. There is no end point.” 22 November After two shows in September and two in October, Christie’s back in Leicester Square. I haven’t seen the show since Edinburgh, and it’s fascinating to give it a second viewing and see how it’s progressed. Tonight there are new sections on Marine Le Pen, Gina Miller’s legal challenge, and “men of the people” Farage and (now victorious) Trump taking a photo in a gold-plated lift. “My job is to make politics absurd,” says Christie to the 400-strong audience. “I’m becoming increasingly irrelevant.”\\n24 January 2017 Christie’s two-week London run starts in a week, and there’s been so much news over the last two months that the show is being reshaped yet again. Trump’s inauguration and his “alternative facts” about the crowd size, the supreme court ruling on Article 50 and Theresa May’s Brexit speech will all potentially be included. “She confirmed we’ll be leaving the single market in order to control immigration and our borders,” explains Christie. “But everyone knew that already. It was only her that thought she could do both. No one else did. It was like a speech for herself, really.” Seven months after the vote, it’s obvious that Christie’s anger about the referendum hasn’t dampened. If anything, she’s more furious than ever. As time has passed, the actions of Johnson, Gove, Cameron and Farage seem increasingly ludicrous, and Christie’s determined not to let us forget how we ended up in this mess of uncertainty. “It’s important people remember the details,” she says. “We have to remember why we’re here and how irresponsible everybody was.” After performing the show in remain-voting London, Because You Demanded It is going on a national tour, to all corners of this divided nation. “It will certainly be an eye opener,” admits Christie, “and it will be interesting, for me, to see how the country responds to it. We’ll see, won’t we? And then that will be another story.” • Bridget Christie: Because You Demanded It is at Leicester Square theatre, London, until 11 February and then on tour.', 'A surge in optimism among young people about jobs and spare cash helped maintain robust consumer confidence in the last three months of 2016, despite fears about Brexit. Spending on essentials, such as groceries, and discretionary items, including meals out, increased as confidence among the 18-34 age group rose to its highest level since advisory firm Deloitte began its quarterly consumer tracker, according to the latest data. The findings come as the Bank of England is expected to upgrade growth forecasts for the second time in three months on Thursday as the UK economy continues to defy expectations of a sharp Brexit slowdown. Analysts at HSBC said the Bank’s growth forecasts were likely to rise to 1.7% for the year, up from 1.4% in November. The economy’s resilience has confounded forecasters, some of whom expected the UK would slip into recession following the shock outcome of the EU referendum last June. However, economists are still predicting a slowdown this year as higher inflation kicks in as a result of a slump in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro, which has increased costs for businesses. The Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, indicated last month that he was likely to raise growth forecasts but said growth was being fuelled by consumer spending and so likely to be “slower and less durable”. Deloitte warned that spending on non-essential items was likely to fall in the next three months as the cost of groceries and other everyday basics rises. Fears about spending were also fuelled by a 2% drop in confidence about disposable income in final quarter of 2016 to -14%. Confidence among young people moved into positive territory but optimism worsened among the 35-55 bracket and the over 55s. While it was the best for the end-of-year quarter since at least 2011, overall confidence levels were 1% worse than in the previous three months. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: “So far, Brexit has not dented consumers’ confidence about the outlook for jobs, particularly among younger workers. Rising real wages, credit growth, high employment and rather more positive business confidence have bolstered consumer spirits and have kept consumer confidence levels stable, and higher than 12 months previously. “However, the new year sees the arrival of headwinds that may challenge the current consumer-friendly economic conditions. “Falling confidence about disposable income may be a sign that we are seeing the start of a squeeze on household incomes. Rising inflation, largely driven by the weakening pound in recent months, will also put pressure on real incomes and consumer spending in 2017.” That prediction was supported by an easing in the pace of growth among private sector companies in the three months to January, according to a CBI survey. The growth indicator poll of 753 manufacturing, distribution and service business revealed that growth eased to a balance of +10%, well below December’s +17% but similar to the pace seen in November and October. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: “Resilience has been the hallmark of the UK economy since the EU Referendum.\\n“But higher inflation is on the way, which will erode consumer incomes, while the impact of uncertainty since the referendum may cause investment spending to slow this year.” Inflation jumped to the highest rate for two and a half years in December, hitting 1.6% after a jump in air fares, food prices and fuel. The December rate, as measured on the consumer prices index (CPI), was the highest since July 2014. The Bank of England is one of the more conservative forecasters, predicting that inflation will hit 2.8% by the middle of 2018. Over the same period, the National Institute for Economic & Social research forecasts that a combination of the low pound and rising wage levels will push inflation to nearer 4%. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said the path of inflation was proving hard to predict, but he believed Threadneedle Street would nudge its forecast higher to 3% at its meeting this week while keeping interest rates on hold. Most analysts believe the central bank will maintain its base rate at 0.25% this year as uncertainty surrounding the outcome of article 50 talks between Britain and the EU undermines investment and jobs growth.', 'David Davis failed to placate Conservative rebels concerned about the status of European Union migrants and other Brexit details, despite publishing a 77-page white paper setting out the government’s plans for leaving the EU. The Brexit secretary presented to parliament further details on the government’s approach, and promised that there have to be specific legislation to define the UK’s immigration and customs policy after the divorce is concluded. Introducing it to the Commons, Davis said the UK’s “best days are still to come” outside the EU and promised a close relationship with the rest of Europe. He also said the UK would do its best to avoid a “cliff-edge” effect. “A never-ending transitional status is emphatically not what we need, not what we seek,” he said. “But a phased process of implementation of new arrangements – whether immigration controls, customs systems, the way we operate and cooperate on criminal and civil justice matters, on future regulatory and legal frameworks of business will be necessary for both sides.”\\nBut there was no development on the future legal status of EU nationals living in the UK or British expats abroad, after the white paper said it had “not proven possible” to reach agreement on future rights with the European Union. While some Tory backbenchers welcomed the reassurances in the document several said they remained worried about the future for EU citizens living in the UK – and asked what would happen at the end of the two year negotiation period. In the House of Commons, Theresa Villiers, the former cabinet minister and Brexit campaigner, was one of those who asked for greater certainty, highlighting the case of a constituent, an EU national who has cancer. Villiers said she was “very anxious to be able to give her certainty as soon as possible that she will continue to have access to the NHS”. She told the Guardian she would “keep making the point over and over again in parliament because on both sides of the house everyone is agreed to that our main objective is to see EU citizens already resident continuing to enjoy all the rights they have at present”. Nigel Evans, a Tory MP and leave supporter, said it was a “form of mental torture and trauma” for EU leaders not to agree to a deal securing the rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU. “Will he redouble his efforts to get this deal done as quickly as possible and make the announcement as quickly as possible?” Evans asked. MPs have tabled more than 150 pages of amendments to the government bill authorising ministers to trigger Brexit, which will be debated when the legislation reaches its committee stage in the House of Commons next week. Harriet Harman has drafted an amendment that would guarantee the rights of EU citizens already living in Britain that has already won the support of more than 30 MPs, including former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.\\nSpeaking in the Commons yesterday on the issue of EU citizens’ rights, Davis said there was “no question that this is not going to happen”, arguing it was simply a matter of the timing of a joint announcement by all EU member states. He said it was clear that nobody would be “throwing people out of Britain” as a result of the Brexit deal. The white paper, entitled The United Kingdom’s Exit From and New Partnership With the European Union, was published a day after MPs voted overwhelmingly to permit May to press ahead with starting withdrawal negotiations. It contained a number of new policy suggestions including potential dispute resolution mechanisms for a trade deal with the EU, which could see a new arbitration system set up. In an introduction to the report, May said the UK does “not approach these negotiations expecting failure, but anticipating success”. Behind the scenes, a number of senior Tories, from both the leave and remain camps, are pressing No 10 to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens to remain in the UK but the government has not yet relented, given the lack of an EU-wide deal. They are also calling for a stronger role for parliament throughout the two-year negotiation process. Anna Soubry, who was a key figure in persuading May to publish the white paper, said she trusted the prime minister to act on the status of EU nationals as soon as possible; but would be studying possible amendments on what she called the “end-game”. “My concern is that if we get a deal, we get a vote in parliament; but if we don’t get a deal, the government has a very serious problem”, she said. Labour backbencher Helen Goodman has tabled an amendment on whether the government must come back to parliament if no deal has been secured at the end of two years – something many EU experts believe is likely.\\nNeil Carmichael, a Tory backbencher opposing a hard Brexit, said he was still thinking about whether to back any amendments to the bill, and would continue to press the government to consult parliament regularly. ”I think it is really important parliament has a role during the next two years because I feel this is a much more complex issue than the white paper acknowledges. We are vulnerable to events and parliament will need to respond in an appropriate and measured way. I think nothing less than pretty regular updates is appropriate,” he said. Carmichael said he would not rule out backing the amendment on the rights of EU nationals as it was not fair to “leave people spinning in the wind”. “The mood within the house is that we have set sail in a very stormy situation and many of us will have to contribute to the debate as it proceeds in the long term,” he said.', 'Environment news Fukushima nuclear reactor radiation at highest level since 2011 meltdown Republicans back off bill to sell 3.3m acres of public land after outcry Sweden criticises US climate stance as it reveals ambitious carbon emissions law Electric cars and cheap solar ‘could halt fossil fuel growth by 2020’ Heathrow third runway will create a more global Britain, says Grayling Rising carbon emissions could kill off vital corals by 2100, study warns Rush to build new homes will increase flooding, experts warn Green movement ‘greatest threat to freedom’, says Trump adviser EU on track to meet renewable energy targets – but UK lags behind Air pollution crisis ‘plagues’ UK, finds UN human rights expert MEPs in bid to force UK to meet environmental regulations after Brexit Features and comment Is chlorinated chicken about to hit our shelves after new US trade deal?

Osborne has made relatively few interventions in the House of Commons since Theresa May removed him from the post of chancellor in July. But on Wednesday he was among scores of MPs who spoke about the risks of Brexit. He said he would not vote against the bill that will allow the government to begin the formal exit process, because ignoring the result of the referendum could provoke “a deep constitutional crisis”.\\nBut he said that by deciding to put immigration control and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court of justice at the top of its agenda, “the government has chosen – and I respect this decision – not to make the economy the priority”. During prime minister’s questions earlier, May said she would publish a white paper on the government’s negotiating plans on Thursday. Tabling a formal paper was a key demand of Conservative rebels, several of whom – including Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary – said they would now vote with the government. However, Morgan said she believed Brexit had added to the risks in global politics. “I have to be honest: never in my adult life have I felt so concerned about the stability and state of the world in which we live. With the Brexit vote, we have added an extra layer of uncertainty to our world,” she said. Osborne was a key figure in the remain campaign, and put the economic costs of Brexit at the centre of an ultimately unsuccessful effort to convince the British public that leaving the EU was not worth the risk. He stressed that the only question on the ballot paper in the referendum had been whether to leave the EU, and tough battles would be fought in the Commons in the years ahead over a series of other issues – free trade, immigration, agricultural protectionism and whether to bail out failing firms. Signalling that he had no intention of abandoning the political frontline, he added: “I will be in those fights.” Osborne’s was one of a series of powerful speeches from MPs conscious of the historic significance of the decision they were being asked to make. He was preceded by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who said he would be voting for the bill at its second reading, but warned the government: “history will judge us not just on the decisions we make on this bill tonight, but on the decisions beyond. The government have a heavy responsibility, and we expect them to exercise it on behalf of the whole nation, not just the 52%. For that we will hold them to account in the months and years ahead.” Alex Salmond, the SNP’s foreign affairs spokesman, said May’s trip to the White House last week underlined the fact that losing EU membership was already forcing the UK strike up too close a relationship with the US. “She goes headlong into the arms of a United States president who is, at best, unpredictable. This is going to get worse and more embarrassing because of the imbalance in the relationship,” he said. A series of Labour backbenchers took to their feet in turn to explain, some in passionate terms, why they would be disregarding their leader’s three-line whip and voting against the triggering of article 50. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for the Rhondda and a former shadow leader of the Commons, said he would be voting against the bill – despite the fact that his constituency voted leave – because he believed in internationalism and tolerance. “All my life I have believed that the best form of patriotism is internationalism,” he said. “I fear the turn this world is taking towards narrow nationalism, protectionism and demagoguery. Distrust of those who are different from us can all too often, although not always, turn to hatred of foreigners. That way lies the trail to war.” He added: “I have stood at every election on a platform and a party manifesto that said we would stay in the European Union. That was my solemn vow to the voters of the Rhondda. I admit that I lost the vote, including in my constituency, but I have not lost my faith. It remains my deep conviction that leaving the European Union, especially on the terms that the government seem to expect, will do untold damage to my constituents, especially the poorest of them.”', 'Jeremy Corbyn is facing a serious revolt by grassroots Labour supporters who backed him to be leader as the party’s crisis over Brexit escalates rapidly. With more members of Corbyn’s frontbench considering resigning – shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens became the first to quit the shadow cabinet on Friday – the rebellion is now spreading among local party members, who are furious at his support for Theresa May’s plans for triggering the article 50 process.\\nOn Saturday night a highly critical open letter to the Labour leader, circulating on Facebook, had been signed by almost 2,000 members in constituency parties across the country, around half of whom are believed to have voted for Corbyn as leader. The letter, organised by a group called Labour Against Brexit, accuses Corbyn of a “betrayal of your socialist values” and of backing a policy that will hurt working people. One of the organisers, Jonathan Proctor of the North Tyneside constituency Labour party, told the Observer that the motive was not to destabilise Corbyn, but to stand up for Labour principles and values. He said the response from members since its launch on Friday had been overwhelming. The letter is the first real sign of grassroots unrest against Corbyn in his own power bases in the constituency parties. It makes clear that his support had been based on a belief that he would create a more democratic party that would be true to Labour values, including supporting EU membership. “In short, we are the grassroots that you have always been keen to represent,” it states. “All of us share core Labour values of equality and opportunity for all, and we share a belief in fighting for social justice. And while we may differ in our beliefs and feelings with regards to your leadership, we are nevertheless united in our belief that you and your leadership team have made the wrong call on the party’s policy on Brexit.”\\nIt adds: “Additionally, many of us voted for you as our leader because of your desire to make the Labour party more democratic, with policy being set by members. At Labour party conference 2016, it was resolved that ‘Unless the final [Brexit] settlement proves to be acceptable, then the option of retaining EU membership should be retained. The final settlement should therefore be subject to approval, through parliament and potentially through a general election or referendum.’ We believe that this exemplar of democracy within the party should no longer be ignored. Let us speak with one voice, as democratically made by our members.” Corbyn has been struggling to hold the party together after saying that Labour MPs would be subject to a three-line whip, instructing them to vote in favour of the parliamentary bill to trigger the Brexit process, which will be debated in the Commons for the first time on Tuesday and Wednesday.\\nTulip Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, has left her frontbench post, and two whips, Thangam Debbonaire and Jeff Smith, have said they will not vote for the bill. Another shadow cabinet member, Rachel Maskell, is said by colleagues to be considering resigning, and Clive Lewis, regarded as close to Corbyn early in his leadership, now says he will vote against the bill at third reading unless there are a series of safeguards. Writing on his Facebook page, Lewis says these must ensure that the UK commits to having “the closest relationship to Europe and the single market as is possible, protect worker rights, have proper report-back mechanisms on the negotiations, and have final say over the eventual negotiated deal”. He adds: “If the government does not accept these amendments, I will vote against triggering article 50 at the third and final vote.” In the Brexit referendum last year, an estimated 65% of Labour voters backed remaining in the European Union, but roughly two-thirds of the constituencies with Labour MPs in place voted, overall, to leave. One of the biggest votes for Brexit came in Stoke, where 69.4% of people voted for Brexit. With Corbyn’s party facing a crucial byelection in Stoke-on-Trent Central on 23 February, caused by the resignation of Tristram Hunt, and another the same day in Copeland in Cumbria, Labour MPs believe Corbyn’s decision to impose a three-line whip is driven in part by fear of being defeated by Ukip. The anti-EU party’s new leader, Paul Nuttall, is standing in the Stoke seat and is expected to run Labour close in one of it traditional strongholds. The official Labour line is that while it understands that many Labour MPs – particularly in seats that voted Remain – are torn over Brexit, the outcome of the referendum was clear, and the “will of the people” should not be obstructed.\\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said there was also anger with Corbyn over the decision to impose a three-line whip on a “timeable motion” that would cut the debate on the bill to five days. Labour members are quitting the party in droves as a result. Referring to Corbyn’s handling of the issue, he said: “It is shockingly bad politics. Everyone understands Labour voters are split down the middle over Brexit – north and south, middle class and working class, young and old – but so too are the Tories. “By taking a side and not allowing MPs to vote with their conscience, Labour’s leadership is forcing an exodus of Remain voters and members. A hard Brexit of the type that the Tories are set on pursuing will hurt Labour supporters and people in Labour areas, so of course there is real concern among colleagues.” A shadow cabinet member told the Observer: “This is not easy for Jeremy and I feel sorry for him. But the way it has been handled is corroding our support. It is falling away fast.” Alex Salmond, the SNP’s international affairs and Europe spokesman, said Labour was “running scared of Ukip and failing to do its constitutional duty of holding the government to account”. He added: “The referendum happened as a result of Tory fear of Ukip, and now it is bulldozed through without proper opposition because of Labour’s fear of Ukip.” Chris Leslie, Labour MP for Nottingham East, who will vote against the bill, said Corbyn was losing support over the issue and asked why he had not put the matter to consultation in the wider party. “There is a very noticeable change of mood among many members who joined recently to support Jeremy. It is surprising, given that he backs giving the membership a say and did so over military action in Syria, that he does not do the same over article 50.”', 'Brexit has been touted as many things but being good for the environment is not one of them. So when David Palmer-Jones, UK CEO of waste and recycling giant Suez, tentatively suggests it could just herald a shift to a more circular economy, you take a mental step backwards. Just how does he work that out? Although Suez was vocal in its desire for the country to remain in the EU, its UK boss recognizes that Brexit might present an opportunity to reframe recycling regulations, many of which stem from Europe. At present, these set straightforward targets for the amount of waste to be recycled – the latest stipulating 50% by 2020. And he’s quick to give the EU praise where it’s due. “We tend to forget that back in 2000, our recycling rate was just 9%. Now it’s 45%.” That’s largely due to European pressure, he says: “Things can move very quickly when fuelled by regulation”. In the UK’s case, this was spurred by landfill tax, which made the old school stick-it-in-a-hole-in-the-ground-and-forget-it approach financially less appealing.\\nOne of the consequences has been a rise in energy recovery: burning waste to generate electricity. Although perhaps sometimes misunderstood, Palmer-Jones insists it’s a proven and safe technology. But he feels its potential is underused in the UK, compared to continental Europe. There, incineration plants are often situated close to communities, so that they can provide both electricity and heat. In the Swedish city of Malmo, for example, “they showed me with great pride how the plant was right in the middle of the town,” says Palmer-Jones, “so it could provide hot water to all the houses in the area. Local people know about it, and know it means they’re getting the benefit from it and saving money too.” In Britain, by contrast, the attitude is “let’s keep it as far away from people as possible – stick it in a quarry so it can’t be seen”. That might satisfy local planning officials, but it’s a lot less efficient in energy terms, as it’s too far away from population centres to provide heat – whether for domestic or industrial uses – so the benefits are restricted to electricity. A preferable alternative, says Palmer-Jones, would be to site the plants close to local industry, so as to meet their heat and power needs. Meanwhile, the downside of present recycling rules is that they can lead to some fairly crude yardsticks. In the UK, recycling rates are typically measured by weight, which doesn’t really discriminate between the relative value of different materials. It’s also open to some pretty random fluctuations. The classic example, says Palmer-Jones, is grass clippings, which weigh much more when wet, and the quantity of which varies with the season. “So you have local authorities having to explain to some poor old Defra official that they had a dryer year, therefore the grass clippings weren’t as heavy as the previous year … What’s the point of that? You’re not really capturing any information of value.” So how might Brexit make it better? First, Palmer-Jones is quick to emphasise that both he and Suez were keen for the UK to remain in the European Union and that he’s not looking for a bonfire of regulations. Far from it – he’s relieved that the government’s planning to incorporate all EU regulations in British law, to be amended or repealed on a case-by-case basis. But when that happens, he’d like to see more sophisticated recycling regulations introduced – with the emphasis on materials stewardship instead of end-of-life disposal. That could mean moving beyond purely weight-based targets, he says. “We should be asking, ‘how can the UK get cleverer after Brexit?”\\nPart of the answer, he believes, lies in regulations which encourage industry to adopt a circular approach. “One of the best ways to do this is to regulate for product take-back.” With this approach, manufacturers would be obliged to recover some or all of their products and product packaging – with the focus placed on those whose materials or products could be easily reused or recycled. This, he argues, would encourage the growth of a stable market in secondary materials, which – because it would be fed by a steady flow of new feedstock – would be insulated to some extent from the volatility of fluctuating commodities prices. “And it would be a lot more politically acceptable – and less burdensome – than some form of tax or levy system.” In practical terms, it could work along the same lines as the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) directive, which requires manufacturers to take back products such as fridges at the end of their life. One thing is certain: the days of landfill are fast coming to an end. Apart from anything else, “there simply aren’t enough holes in the ground”, says Palmer-Jones. “For example, by 2021, there will be no landfill space left in Kent.” So while hoping for a shift towards a circular, product-stewardship, approach in the long term, he’s also looking for government to give a clear commitment to the landfill tax “over the next 10 years or so.” Hs is cautiously encouraged by noises emanating from the government on this, and on their industrial strategy more broadly. But, he adds, “We’d love them to come out and make some clear statements. They’re very good at implying things, but not actually saying them out loud. That’s a bit too subtle for us! The one thing industry really needs is certainty.” Content on this page is paid for and produced to a brief agreed by Suez, sponsor of the circular economy hub', 'He was magnificent. Ken Clarke spoke for saving Britain, and he spoke for the three-quarters of MPs who never supported this madness. But on his own benches he is the lone refuser, the only one who will vote today against what most of Clarke’s colleagues and almost all on the Labour benches know to be an approaching Brexit calamity. Like a prophet crying in the wilderness – dismissed as “purple and quavery”, and his words as a “pitiful harrumph” in the Daily Mail – his speech will resonate down the Brexit years. How did it come to this act of collective cowardice? Because rebelling against your own leadership is easy, and usually delights the voters with a show of sterling independence. But to rebel against the voters – that takes formidable courage.\\n“Now I’m being told I’m somehow an enemy of the people!” Clarke protested with outrage. He had earned his right to make a sweeping dismissal of the referendum for the absurdity of such “an enormous question answered with a single yes or no on one day”, since he alone had voted against holding one. The real betrayal of voters, he said, was for MPs not to vote with their conscience and judgment. With no notes, Clarke’s 17-minute tour de force was a history lesson about his generation. He has spent a political career spanning nearly 50 years hauling Britain into the modern world, rescuing it from its final “appalling” colonial disaster, Suez. We had no role once we had lost an empire, he said, and our economy “was becoming a laughing stock”. As a young man he worked with Edward Heath, easing the country into the common market, where “our membership restored our national self-confidence”, “made us more valuable to our US allies” and more secure against Russia in the cold war. But for Margaret Thatcher, he said, there would never have been a single market: it was her pressure that broke down those barriers – “and we benefited more than any other state”. Brexit is “baffling to every friend throughout the world”. What we heard from him was a eulogy and an epitaph for the passing of an era where the European idea was the guiding light for all the enlightened liberals of his generation. Withering barbs aplenty he had for the turncoats who had suddenly seen “a light on the road to Damascus on the twenty-third of June. I’m afraid that light has been denied to me.” Wise scorn was poured on that trading “wonderland” down the rabbit hole, where “nice men like President Trump and President Erdoğan” are “impatient to abandon their normal protectionism, queuing up to give us access to their markets”. He ended with a priestly warning to the souls of the pro-EU MPs all around him: “As we see what unfolds hereafter as we leave the European Union, I hope the consciences of other MPs remain equally content.” The agonised wriggling and writhing of Labour and Tory remainers showed how well he twisted the knife. The Commons will today vote overwhelmingly to trigger article 50, with the SNP, Liberal Democrats and some 35 Labour rebels holding out. Crucial amendments will not be passed at the next stage, and yet MPs will still vote to proceed. Remainers rely on the chance to vote at the end of the process, when the public finally stares a hard Brexit in the face and confronts what that really means. But even the right to hold that vote before the deal is sealed looks doubtful. The mad zeal of the Europhobes, still astounded that their small cult has swept the country, had full rein yesterday. Jacob Rees-Mogg proclaimed this moment stood with Agincourt and Waterloo; most MPs know this is Dunkirk. Meanwhile, Labour’s leavers disgraced themselves again: Gisela Stuart pleaded for EU residents to be allowed to remain – but why didn’t she insist on that first? Kate Hoey claimed the Brexiters were not anti-immigrant, but fewer people coming from the EU meant a fairer chance for those from further afield. As if! As the shadowy shape of new alliances emerged, there were great cheers for Clarke from the Labour benches. The Conservative Anna Soubry sounded briefly like one of them, voting “with a heavy heart”, believing “history will not be kind to this parliament”. The divide between remainers and leavers looks sometimes deeper than party tribes on this the most important event since the last war. Are tectonic plates shifting?\\nI suspect not really. Splendid though Ken Clarke is on all things European, he is a Tory to the tips of his Hush Puppies. As chancellor in the 90s his austerity was brutal, leaving a legacy of public squalor and an attitude towards parsimony that forced Gordon Brown to follow that disastrous path for two more years. As Thatcher’s health secretary, it was he who marketised the NHS, fatally splitting it between purchasers and providers. Nonetheless, as Tories go, he is the best: too good for them, rejected as leader three times in favour of duds, including Iain Duncan Smith. He opposed the Iraq war. As lord chancellor, he was “astonished” at a prison population of 85,000, and set about reducing it. He called Cameron’s proposed bill of rights “xenophobic and legal nonsense”. With his joyful hinterland of jazz and motor racing, he is a rare politician who talks humanly, though he is almost impossible to interview on television due to his never-ending sentences. This was no farewell. Clarke will be here all through this terrible Brexit process, warning, admonishing, mocking and doing his damnedest to avert this act of national lunacy.', 'In the end, 47 Labour MPs decided to vote against the bill triggering article 50. Two more frontbenchers, Dawn Butler and Rachel Maskell, resigned in order to vote against Jeremy Corbyn’s ill-advised three-line whip. Many MPs, in two days of often deeply felt debate, said they felt bound to honour their voters’ wishes despite their belief that leaving the EU will be a disaster for the economy, and regardless of the majority for remain among people who would normally vote Labour. The difficulty of this vote for the party was etched on the face of the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, as he wove his way through the mess of conflicting ambitions that constitute current party policy. We would rather that the party had voted with its heart than, as it perhaps did, with an eye on its electoral prospects in leave areas like Stoke and Copeland. We would say the same about the Conservative remainers too. But Labour’s equivocations on Europe long predated the vote and will continue long after. Yet unless it can find a stronger position to unite around on such a central issue, Labour will struggle to be a credible party of opposition.\\nBut Labour’s dismal performance is not the real scandal of Wednesday’s vote, and those who pretend it is are playing the leavers’ game. The real scandal is that, with the distinguished exception of Ken Clarke, the Tory party’s many remainers bent the knee. As a result, the government had an overwhelming majority on the second reading of the bill to trigger article 50. Its failure to publish a white paper before the debate went unpunished. This disregard for the most basic of requirements for a decision of such consequence must not be allowed to be a taste of things to come. It is all the more alarming that, as late as Tuesday, it seems no draft had been circulated: the home secretary, a member of the small group of senior ministers who sit on the cabinet committee on Brexit, told MPs she had not seen it. Yet, even as the potentially grim consequences of Brexit become clearer, Theresa May’s timetable for the process of departure remains on track. It is not all over, however. Everything is still possible. Now the prime minister must come clean about the choices that lie ahead, and their consequences – and she must convey to the whole of Britain the scale of the task ahead. Even without a white paper, it is clear that she puts controlling borders and repatriating law at the head of her list of priorities. It is also clear, as George Osborne told the Commons, that at the head of the EU’s list is the integrity of the union of the remaining 27 members. Those governing ideas will, unavoidably, make many of the other ambitions that Mrs May set out in her speech a fortnight ago extremely challenging. The negotiations will be just that – negotiations that must be conducted with the intention of reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both sides. It is an irony that Mrs May will not appreciate that the European court of justice from which she so ardently wishes to escape is highly likely to be called in to adjudicate on aspects of the final deal, as its president Koen Lenaerts points out. Mrs May talks ominously about no deal being better than a bad deal, and claims to be prepared to crash out on World Trade Organisation terms. This is a terrible strategy. As the SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, put it at prime minister’s questions, Mrs May has made one successful foreign trip in the past week. That was her trip to Dublin, where she and the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, discussed how best to preserve the free trade area and protect the Northern Ireland peace process. She would do well to take the lesson about the value of negotiations conducted in good faith and a spirit of cooperation. A hard Brexit would be ruinous. Every MP should spend the coming week consulting their local businesses on the impact of WTO terms, and calculate their likely impact on jobs and prices. The referendum itself has been a catastrophe. But if Mrs May continues to treat leaving the EU as if it can be achieved in a couple of years of hard work, she is doing the voters a grave disservice. She knows the cost of making pledges on immigration that are unachievable. Suggesting that Brexit can be done and dusted before the next election is a deceit on a monstrous scale. As Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, told MPs on the Brexit committee on Wednesday morning, the task ahead was “humongous”. It would, unavoidably, be bloody. This will be a long game, and the government must say so.', 'At last, parliament moves to the centre of the Brexit process. Tuesday is the first of two days’ debate on the bill to trigger article 50; after all the talk on the right of a coup, of power ebbing from Westminster, of a vacuum at the centre, MPs have a chance to get into the fight. Next week, there are three more days’ debate on amendments, before the bill goes to the Lords. It seems neither chamber will seriously try to get in the way of Theresa May’s self-imposed deadline of the end of March for triggering the two-year process of leaving. That is a mistake. For six months, parliament has struggled with the right response to a referendum that returned a result probably supported by fewer than 160 MPs. The vote was held under casually drafted regulations that ignored the importance of ensuring buy-in throughout the United Kingdom, which is why the prime minister was playing catch-up in Wales and Ireland today. Parliament was told officially that referendums are no more than an expression of political will. But both sides insisted that the result would be irrevocable, and, by saying it, made it so. Enfeebled by shock and uncertainty, and with no leave process mapped out, parliament failed to muster the resolve to force its way into the process of departure. Genuinely taken aback by the extent of discontent the referendum exposed, afraid of being portrayed as an obstacle to the will of the people, MPs’ lack of leadership has weakened parliament itself. After David Cameron resigned, it was clear that his successor’s mandate was to implement the result. The large majority of MPs who fear that leaving the EU will be a catastrophe for many of their constituents have been left in impotent submission to the sheer weight of the vote for the other side. Without Gina Miller and her co-applicants’ determination to fight for parliament in court, ministers might already be negotiating with complete disregard for it. Now Westminster has the chance to claw back its proper role in the most important event in recent British history. It must locate its spine. The government is too easily tempted to undermine MPs by negotiating directly with the leave constituency. The evidence for that is everywhere, in the attempt to avoid parliament entirely until the supreme court intervened, and in the few short days of debate now allowed to MPs. When parliament voted on the principle (only the principle) of joining the European Community in 1972, there were 10 days of debate on a detailed white paper, and the actual legislation took five months. Tuesday’s bill is a single page and the scope for amendments small. Labour, trying to shape the process over the next two years, has tabled a fistful aimed at securing protection of workers’ rights and common tax and evasion measures. Most significantly, it is determined to get a meaningful vote in parliament at the end of the process. Yet, regardless of the outcome, Labour MPs will be whipped to get the bill through.\\nPerhaps these are wise objectives for a party trying to find common ground between its diehard leavers and its equally passionate remainers. All the same, there may be smarter tactical objectives that could pull in the kind of cross-party support that might make the government act more cautiously in the years ahead. For example, there are sensible reasons for a delay in triggering article 50, since between now and September – that is, for a quarter of the two-year negotiating period – the Netherlands, France and Germany, key players in the process, will be preoccupied with national elections. If parliament imposed a pause until the new European governments are in place, it would send an unmistakable signal about its seriousness of purpose. More important still is to find a way to frame the demand for a “meaningful vote” that mobilises doubters across the parties. The government should allow the last vote at Westminster to coincide with the European parliament’s ratification process, so that there is a possibility of constructive alliances. For generations, Europe has deeply divided people and parties. Parliament is the place not for capitulation but reconciliation. By the same token, Mrs May should acknowledge that having Westminster behind her would offer her a badly needed asset in her asymmetrical negotiation with Brussels. And in these anxious days, when Donald Trump treats the world’s fragile interconnections like a vicious crockery smash, and the European parliament negotiator Guy Verhofstadt suggests his real intention is to break up the EU, the prime minister should think hard before slamming the door on old friends.', 'Donald Trump and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, are determined to break up the European Union, and are working to stage exit referendums in Berlin and Paris, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, has said. He claimed Trump represented the third threat to the EU alongside Vladimir Putin and Islamic extremism, adding that the US president’s call to organise the continent of Europe around national identity risked playing with fire. His dramatic remarks at the Chatham House thinktank in London on Monday underline how some Europeans believe Trump represents an existential threat to the EU project and to European values. The former Belgian prime minister and leader of the European liberal group said disaster lay ahead if the continent followed Trump’s call to return to nationalism. Saying the EU faced three threats, he identified the first as “radicalised political Islam that has mounted attacks on European soil”. The second was Putin, “who is trying to undermine the EU from inside with cyber-attacks and financing far-right political parties including [Geert] Wilders in the Netherlands and [Marine] Le Pen in France”. He added: “My impression is we have a third front undermining the EU, and that is Donald Trump, who ... has spoken very favourably that other countries will want to break away from the EU, and that he hoped for a disintegration of the EU.”\\nHe accused Bannon, who previously oversaw Breitbart news, of trying to foment anti-EU feeling in Europe. “He is sending people now to Paris and Berlin to prepare for similar referendums ... as Brexit,” he said. After his speech he pointed to the growth of Breitbart websites in Europe. Verhofstadt, who had just returned from the US, said: “I can tell you that every European I met there had drawn only one conclusion and that is the EU has fewer friends than ever in the US.” He also claimed Trump’s populism was influenced by European populism. “It’s the opposite of what people think – it’s from here first and it went over the Atlantic,” Verhofstadt said. He also warned that Trump’s allies did not understand the dangers posed to Europe by populism and national identities based on ethnicity rather than shared values. “Thirty million people have died because of pogroms and ethnic cleansing in Europe,” he said. “Putting your political thinking and future organisation of Europe on nationalist ideas is the most stupid thing you can do. It’s playing with fire, knowing what it has created in the past.” Although he warned that a breakup of the EU would be a disaster, he said: “It would be ridiculous not to recognise that the EU is involved in multiple crises – security, migration, geopolitical weakness in our neighbourhood and poor economic results in the south of Europe.”\\nBut he said the Brexit negotiations represented “a golden opportunity” for the EU to remake itself, saying there was a new generation of younger, pro-European politicians such as Emmanuel Macron who were willing to defend Europe from attacks by the populist right. On the Brexit talks, he said the critical period was relatively short between Theresa May triggering article 50 and the need for the European parliament to craft a response ahead of the European parliamentary elections in 2019. He also rejected suggestions that the exit part of the negotiations would have to be completed first and conducted independent of the discussion about the UK’s future relationship with the EU. He said that any deal would have to be ratified by the European parliament as well to be legally enacted. If the European parliament does not sign off on the deal, the UK “will exit without any agreement”, Verhofstadt said.', 'Language is constantly evolving. “Girl”, for example, used to mean any young person, male or female, while “sly” was skilful and “nice” was stupid. Right now, “literal” is turning into figurative. But never has the change been so rapid. Ever since the Brexit debate heated up last year, we’ve been pelted with bureaucratic jargon such as “article 50” and “equivalence”, while seeing everyday phrases twisted out of all recognition. So here’s an A-Z to see you through the next few months, years or decades as we negotiate a new relationship with our frenemies on the wrong side of the channel.

Had the economy performed as George Osborne predicted it would in the fevered days before the referendum, late January 2017 would have been the moment when official data showed that output in the UK had contracted in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016 – the technical definition of a recession. Instead, Philip Hammond was in the happy position of being able to use a visit to Microsoft’s UK headquarters in Reading to announce that growth in the final three months of 2016 had been 0.6% – exactly the same as in the previous two quarters. Hammond said the reason the Treasury had got it so wrong was that it had assumed the government would trigger article 50 negotiations with the EU straight after the Brexit vote, and had not reckoned with the Bank of England providing post-referendum stimulus.\\nThis is not wholly convincing. Given that nobody in Whitehall was prepared for a vote to leave, the idea that Britain would start divorce proceedings straight away was highly unlikely. Nor was it really feasible that Mark Carney and the other eight members of Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee would sit on their hands. A better explanation for the robust performance of the economy is that consumers have carried on spending. The factors that underpinned domestic demand ahead of the referendum – low unemployment, rising house prices and rock-bottom interest rates – are still in place. The Bank’s decision to cut rates and to deliver another dollop of quantitative easing in August has, if anything, created even more growth-friendly conditions. Those who confidently predicted that the economy would plunge immediately into recession now have an alternative narrative, namely that the real pain will not come until article 50 has been triggered. This, though, is not what they were saying six months ago and necessitates significant post-rationalisation. What is certainly true is that growth continues to be highly unbalanced. It has been the service sector that has been keeping the economy going over the past six months, with retailing and hospitality especially strong.\\nHammond said at Microsoft that while he expected the fall in the value of the pound to slow consumer spending through its impact on imports, he had been pleasantly surprised by how slow the effects from the depreciation of the pound had been. The performance of the economy in the second half of 2016 means that forecasters have been revising up their growth estimates for 2017. That looks smart, particularly against a backdrop of a pick-up in global demand spearheaded by the US. A few months ago, the expectation was that Hammond would use his budget in early March to provide a fillip to the economy. The chancellor no longer deems that necessary. The main fiscal event of the year – when the big decisions on tax and spending will take place – is going to be in the autumn. The March budget is going to be a dull affair.', 'Theresa May is planning to publish the government’s Brexit white paper on Thursday but could first make one further concession by agreeing to report back to parliament on a regular basis, sources have told the Guardian. They have suggested that the prime minister is minded to accept quarterly reporting of progress on Brexit negotiations – which is being demanded by Conservative backbenchers, Labour and other opposition parties.\\nIt comes as Tory rebels suggest they are unlikely to back any further amendments to the article 50 bill to be debated in the House of Commons this week, suggesting it will be sent to the Lords unchanged. That is likely to add pressure to senior Labour figures to consider voting against the bill, with the shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, telling his local party he will not back the legislation if it is not amended. With Jeremy Corbyn making clear that Labour MPs should vote for article 50, the move would suggest that Lewis is likely to return to the backbenches. Dozens of Labour MPs are expected to vote against article 50, especially those who hold remain-supporting constituencies. However, the band of Tory MPs fighting against a hard Brexit are indicating they have been largely satisfied by the prime minister’s promise of a white paper. Labour and the Liberal Democrats now believe there is very little chance of getting enough cross-party votes for amendments. They had hoped to win support on issues such as guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals, and a more meaningful vote at the end of the two-year negotiations or protections in the Commons. Opposition parties are concentrating on getting the government to concede points voluntarily, with Labour MPs believing the most likely proposal to be accepted is a demand for May to provide quarterly updates to parliament on the process of negotiations. MPs are due to start debating the bill in parliament on Tuesday. The legislation would give May the power to invoke article 50 and start two years of negotiations to leave the EU. The Commons will debate the bill for two days before a vote expected on Wednesday night. More detailed scrutiny involving proposed amendments to the legislation will begin next week. Amendments laid down include some trying to stop Brexit going ahead, demands for a referendum on the final deal and for British to remain in the single market and calling for effective consultation. John Penrose, a Tory MP in the European Reform Group, which includes dozens of backbenchers who supported Brexit and some who backed remain, urged MPs to respect the referendum result. “More people voted for Brexit than for anything in British democratic history, ever,” he said. “Those supporting the idea of a second referendum are not being straight with the electorate. They must know that it’s not possible to have a referendum once the deal is agreed at the end of the negotiation process – by then we will have left. They are offering a false choice.” He also insisted there had been a “vast amount of consultation with the devolved administrations and there will continue to be. What they are really calling for – and they should be forthcoming about this – is a veto but the supreme court has ruled that out.” He said the SNP wanted preconditions that could not be guaranteed. The government was forced to bring legislation to parliament after the supreme court ruled that May did not have the power to trigger article 50 without the permission of MPs and peers. Ahead of the first day of debate, May said MPs faced a “simple decision: do they support the will of the British people or not?” “My message to people is very clear,” she said during a press conference in Ireland. “The people of the United Kingdom voted on 23 June last year, they voted in a referendum that was given to them overwhelmingly by parliament. Six to one parliament voted. The people spoke in that vote, and the majority voted to leave the European Union. The job of the government is to put that into practice.” David Davis, the Brexit secretary, echoed her words, saying MPs were considering a “very simple question: do we trust the people or not?” One MP engaged in cross-party discussions said there was a reluctance among Tory MPs to step out of line, but there were some who were still thinking of ways to use this bill to nudge May away from the hardest Brexit path. However, a senior Lib Dem source said there was “no chance” of getting any substantial amendments passed with cross-party support and the debate was likely to be a “damp squib”. The legislation is likely to pass overwhelmingly with the support of almost all Conservatives and the Labour frontbench. The biggest bloc of votes against article 50 on Wednesday is likely to come from the SNP, whose 54 MPs will oppose the legislation from the outset. Stephen Gethins, the SNP Europe spokesman, also criticised the prime minister for failing to publish the promised white paper before the first debate, leaving parliamentarians and the public heading blindly towards leaving the EU and policies based on “soundbites rather than sound arguments”. There is a greater chance that the bill could be amended in the Lords, although peers are likely to want to avoid the appearance of trying to frustrate the bill because they are unelected parliamentarians. The government announced on Monday that peers would debate the legislation after the parliamentary recess next month, after it clears the House of Commons on either 8-9 February. It will then be introduced for scrutiny by the Lords, where the government does not have a majority, on Monday 20 February, before completing its passage through the House of Lords probably on 7 March. If peers make any amendments, it would have to return to the Commons, where MPs would debate whether to keep the changes or get rid of them. That would see the bill repeatedly move between the Commons and the Lords until an agreement were reached on the final text. May is aiming to have the bill passed through both Houses to meet her self-imposed deadline of triggering article 50 by the end of March.', 'As every parent knows, leadership sometimes means knowing when to give in. Theresa May opened Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions with an unexpected concession – yet she still emerged victorious from her weekly bout with Jeremy Corbyn. Rebel backbenchers in the prime minister’s own party, led by troublemaker-in-chief Anna Soubry, had united around the demand for the government to publish a formal white paper, setting out its priorities for the forthcoming negotiations. May’s stance, including plans to leave the single market and the customs union, emerged clearly from the “12-point plan” she laid out in her speech at Lancaster House last week. But MPs hoped a formal white paper would give them the opportunity to discuss and debate the details – and to constrain the government’s future room for manoeuvre. With Labour’s support, and that of the Liberal Democrats, the Tory rebels believed they had enough backing to carry an amendment to the government’s Brexit legislation, demanding a white paper. May’s whips, who have been meeting the well-organised caucus of MPs, apparently came to the same conclusion. Her announcement was in part a victory for the gradualist approach of Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who has pushed for more detail to be revealed about how the government plans to take Britain out of the EU. It also opens May up to the risk that the rebels, emboldened by their victory, will demand more red meat as the bill makes its way through parliament. Some would like to see the vote she has promised on the final deal made more meaningful, for example. But by announcing a white paper at the start of PMQs in response to a planted question from the party loyalist Chris Philp, May wrongfooted Corbyn, who had clearly been planning to use at least some of his six questions to press her on the issue. The Labour leader still warned about the potential risks of a trade deal with Donald Trump’s US; and accused May of wanting to turn Britain into a “bargain basement” tax haven – his current favourite soundbite. But May’s responses underlined the potential pitfalls ahead for Labour. Corbyn’s party, and even his shadow cabinet, is deeply riven – some MPs who represent pro-remain seats are struggling to back Brexit, particularly on the prospectus May set out last week, while others, including the leader himself, believe the party must not be seen to ignore the referendum result. The prime minister – remain campaigner turned red-white-and-blue Brexiter – is ready to exploit those differences ruthlessly, accusing Corbyn and his colleagues of being unable to speak for each other, let alone for Britain. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Newsnight on Tuesday there would be “hand to hand combat” over the Brexit bill. Some in Labour fear the worst hostilities may be on their own side.', 'Brexiters toasting an impending exit from the EU with a pint of ale could be in for a sobering shock, after some of Britain’s top brewers warned that the weak pound is putting the craft beer revolution at risk. The country’s brewery industry has been enjoying a renaissance, with about 200 new breweries a year adding to the choice for drinkers. But small-scale brewing is already feeling the pinch from the slump in sterling, which has sent the cost of imported ingredients and equipment soaring.\\nNow drinkers, already asked to pay more than £5 a pint for some independent brews, are being warned that they may have to accept price rises or switch to cheaper mass-market brands. Unlike multinational beer companies behind such brands, which are not immune to the weak pound but spend relatively little on ingredients, craft brewers scour the globe for the best hops and malt, often preferring overseas varieties. “Everybody’s noticed it and it’s to be expected because you’re importing hops from places like the US and Europe,” said Andrew Paterson, head brewer at Dark Star Brewing in West Sussex. “It’s also the case for steel tanks, kegs, yeast manufactured in Holland, anything that’s imported. We’re not going to compromise on quality so it’s an ongoing cost.” Fabio Israel, head brewer at Bedlam Brewery, says the Brexit effect is making it harder for firms such as his to grow. Bedlam, which like Dark Star is also based in West Sussex, is planning to build a new brewery and Israel reckons the investment cost has gone up from about £500,000 to £600,000. He has also been forced to pay more for malt from Germany, yeast from France and hops from the US and the Czech Republic. The end result, says Israel, is that beer companies must either risk their own survival by absorbing cost increases, or ask consumers to fork out more. “We’ll work hard to keep costs where they are but everything is getting more expensive and we’re likely at some stage to pass these costs on to publicans.” While established independent brewers with a loyal customer base can wield some pricing power, cost increases pose more of a threat for newcomers. Neil Randle had just launched Bang On Brewery in Bridgend, Wales, when the Brexit result sent the pound into a tailspin. “Within our first month of trading, the price of pretty much everything has gone up,” he said. “Brewers work on pretty tight margins. Pubs are already trying to squeeze the margins to increase their profits so we’re being squeezed from both ends.” The flip side of the devalued pound is that brewers’ pain could be British farmers’ gain. The price of hops was on the rise well before the EU vote, owing to increasing demand for hop-heavy craft beers and limited supply. “Imported varieties are more expensive due to the drop in the value of the pound so British brewers using these varieties have taken a double hit on the price,” says Paul Corbett, managing director of hop merchant Charles Faram. “The good news for British hop growers is that their hops are much more competitive and they are now seeing increasing demand.” Gavin Hogg, managing director of Salcombe Brewery in Devon, has witnessed the same effect in the price of barley. “UK barley is very attractive to overseas buyers right now so that’s pushing up the price for us by about £50 per tonne.” But while some brewers are considering switching to British-grown ingredients, Hogg is among those far from thrilled about that prospect. He says UK soil is not right for growing some types of hops such as Citra and Mount Rainier. “The Americans produce really good hop varieties and we don’t in the UK, so we’re at the whim and mercy of the exchange rate,” he adds. Hogg says Salcombe has begun buying more hops in advance to hedge against any further falls in the pound. Daniel Lowe, co-founder of London brewery Fourpure, took a different route, buying euros before the EU referendum to insulate the business against currency risk. For brewers who export, there is some upside. “Five days after the [Brexit] vote, when the pound dropped to €1.20, we exported our first pallet to Germany,” says Israel. “The buyer didn’t want to buy but five days after Brexit we offered a 15% discount, which was basically the drop in the pound.” However, Israel warns that the export benefits are far outweighed by import costs. That leaves drinkers with a Hobson’s choice: pay more for beer, or risk seeing their favourite brewers go out of business. The Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA), which represents 850 breweries in the UK, is hoping ale enthusiasts are prepared to dig deeper into their wallets. “It is important that beer drinkers understand the challenges that face Britain’s independent brewers in terms of rising costs but also the fundamental truth that craft beers rely heavily on quality, often imported ingredients,” said its managing director, Mike Benner. “Independent brewers use these quality ingredients purely for their flavour, which means consumers are getting very good value for money when they choose an independent craft beer.”', 'Constitutions are usually invoked by the losing side\\xa0in a political argument. Appeals to the rule book signal that a cause, while not hopeless, is short of weapons more practical than hope. So it is with those who would delay or halt Britain’s departure from the European Union. The supreme court notionally helped them by upholding a high court ruling that the government must seek parliament’s approval before activating article 50 of the combined EU treaties – the point at which Brexit is\\xa0almost certainly irreversible. But it looks unstoppable already.\\nThe judgment does not make Brexit less likely, but it does make Brexit\\xa0more parliamentary. It puts the referendum result in its place: politically irresistible but not a licence for unchecked executive power; a clear instruction from the majority but not a dissolution of minority opinion. This news is inconvenient for Theresa May but healthy for democracy. May does not doubt that MPs will trigger article 50. They have already backed her proposal to get it done before the end of March, and by a majority of 372. That was a nonbinding vote, but there is no reason to think a binding one will produce dramatically different results. Labour says it will table amendments\\xa0attaching all manner of conditions, but the impact will be marginal. Plenty of opposition MPs are persuaded – some on principle, others because they are intimidated by the volume of leave voters in their constituencies – that the referendum result demands prompt satisfaction. Jeremy Corbyn’s party is engaged in\\xa0the Brexit debate like a dog on a football\\xa0pitch – eager to be where the action is without knowing in which direction it should be running. Liberal Democrats and Scottish Nationalists are more focused but lack the numbers to cause a major obstruction. Most pro-European Tory MPs still hope their concerns will be heeded by May behind closed doors. They recognise that she rates personal loyalty above almost any other virtue, and are thus reluctant to make trouble in public. I have heard remainer Tories say they are encouraged by what they have heard in private communications with No 10. But there is no tangible evidence that their softly-softly approach has any effect; the loudly-loudly manners of hardline Brexiters set the national tone.\\nThere is a large parliamentary caucus to support a judicious enactment of the referendum mandate – one that is consistent with the technical requirement to quit the EU, while proceeding delicately through the detail so as not to vandalise economic and diplomatic relations with continental neighbours. But it is scattered across different parties, with no headquarters and no leader. If there is parliamentary resistance to May’s Brexit vision it is unlikely to be organised around article 50. The more promising battlefield is the “great repeal bill” that the government has promised in spring. This will be a monstrously baggy piece of legislation. It must migrate the entire edifice of European law, currently applicable by virtue of EU treaties, on to the statute books as free-standing UK law. This has to be done to avoid legal black holes when Britain’s treaty commitments expire. This same law will also create a mechanism for ministers to expunge features of the European legacy post-Brexit, at their leisure. This involves “delegated powers” by which the government can change statutes without running the full gauntlet of MP scrutiny. (These are sometimes called “Henry VIII clauses” in memory of his attempts to merge royal whim with the law.) If the “great” repeal device includes rigorous checks and balances, parliament will be bogged down for years. But if it is designed for efficiency, the government will acquire a formidable weapon for erasing laws at a stroke. That prospect is sure to offend MPs from all parties. It is sure to trample on the remit of devolved assemblies. The Lords will guard its backstop powers jealously, causing many Tories to discover a sudden appetite for reforming\\xa0the upper chamber. The whole thing is going to get messy. These coming conflicts and the supreme court case have a common root: tension between the political heft of a plebiscite and the constitutional fact of parliamentary sovereignty. The\\xa0mandate of the referendum is newer; the mandate of MPs is better. Brexiters may brandish “the will of the people” as if it were a machete cutting through thickets of opposition, but their sharp rhetoric has legal limits. As the high court noted in its ruling last year, quoting the jurist AV Dicey: “The judges know nothing about any will of the people except insofar as that will is expressed by an act of Parliament.” Ministers sounded more deferential to that opinion on Tuesday than they did after their first defeat. In November, May’s inability to voice distaste for the hounding of judicial “enemies of the people” by Brexit-hungry newspapers looked like complicity in the attack. That caused alarm in some EU capitals, notably Berlin, where the totalitarian idiom is not bandied about so lightly. Downing Street had to give private reassurance of Britain’s enduring respect for judicial independence.\\nMay is more confident of MPs’ support for Brexit now, but not necessarily more patient with dissent. She sees the referendum as an instruction for government ranging beyond the question on the ballot paper, and treats the result as an expression of economic and cultural insecurity – a howl of rage against a metropolitan liberal ruling class. May’s Brexit mission is a project of national salvation, not some technical exercise in treaty revision. Aligning herself with this maximalist definition of the referendum is a way to grab electoral legitimacy. It retrofits a personal mandate on to her leadership, since she came to the top job without one. But the prime minister is not the figurehead of a revolutionary movement. She has permission to govern only because her party commands a majority in the Commons. Her insight into the “will of the people” is no greater than anyone else’s, nor any more constitutionally binding. Those are the rules. It might be frustrating to be reminded of them but if the institutions of a democracy did not sometimes restrain rulers, they wouldn’t be doing their job. The supreme court has proved it is up to the task. Now it is parliament’s turn.', 'For all the anticipation and fuss attached to Tuesday’s supreme court ruling, it is likely to change little in the government’s plans for enacting Brexit. Here are the main processes likely in the coming months: Article 50 legislation Responding in parliament to the ruling, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said a bill to trigger article 50 would be published “within days”. Government sources later said this was expected on Thursday. Once this happens, the first reading of the bill – a formality, which does not involve a debate – could follow immediately. It would, Davis said, be “the most straightforward bill possible to give effect to the decision of the people and respect the supreme court’s judgment”. However, answering questions in the Commons, Davis conceded that drafting a bill that could not be amended would most likely be impossible. Either way, it seems very likely the article 50 bill will pass, even if meeting the government’s self-imposed deadline of the end of March will be tight. This might involve seeking to get the bill through the Commons by the parliamentary recess in late February. The Scottish National party and Lib Dems will be likely to vote against the bill if their amendments are not passed, and some Labour rebels will join them. But overall Labour has no desire to appear to be trying to prevent the referendum result being honoured. Sources in the House of Lords say peers will try to “improve the legislation” through the process but not necessarily by way of parliamentary defeats. A white paper on Brexit Speaking in parliament, Davis was adamant there was no need for a formal document on the government’s plans, saying Theresa May’s speech on the subject last week was all the formal detail needed. However, the debate saw MP after MP, including a number of Conservatives, press the case for a white paper. The government’s working majority of 16 might be too small to avoid giving way on the issue, especially after the Commons Brexit committee – which has 10 Tory members – called unanimously for a white paper. Parliamentary scrutiny Davis told MPs there would be plenty of opportunities for MPs to scrutinise the Brexit process and “many, many, many votes” on it. However, it is unclear what changes might come from this. Davis insisted that the basic premise of Brexit involving departure from the EU’s single market and customs union was not up for debate. “I’m afraid it’s very difficult to see how you can leave the European Union and still stay inside the single market, with all the commitments that go with that,” he said. The devolved nations A secondary, and equally anticipated, element of the supreme court ruling was to confirm that the government does not need formal approval from the devolved administrations for Brexit. However, the views from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will remain important for the government, both in terms of SNP threats over a second independence referendum, and to avoid the perception of a plan being pushed through by an England-dominated cabinet. Unveiling a joint Labour/Plaid Cymru plan for Wales to retain access to the single market, the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, said on Monday he did not think May’s government would want to enter EU negotiations “with a public battle taking place with the devolved governments”. The final vote Davis was asked on Tuesday if there would be an interim Commons vote at the end of trade negotiations. There would not, he said. MPs will thus be left with a final vote on the eventual deal, when it is completed, as outlined by May in her speech. However, it will not, as it stands, be much of a choice. May said in her speech that if MPs reject the deal, it would not see the government obliged to resume the negotiations. Instead, the UK would leave the EU but without any trade deal, reverting immediately to default World Trade Organisation terms. However, Labour hopes one possible amendment to the article 50 bill could be to force the government to return to the EU if the deal is voted down, rather than leaving without an agreement. If that amendment were to attract wide political support, the two-year exit that ministers hope for could prove difficult to achieve.', 'Anti-Brexit campaigners are hoping to organise the biggest protest march seen in modern British history, drawing fresh inspiration from the success of anti-Trump rallies around the world.\\nUnite for Europe, an umbrella group of remain campaigners, plans to march on parliament at 11am on 25 March – the last weekend before Theresa May’s self-imposed deadline for launching the process of leaving the European Union – hoping to attract a crowd in excess of three-quarters of a million people. “I don’t think we were ever under the illusion that the march would stop article 50 being triggered; it is more about demonstrating the strength of opinion against Brexit,” said Peter French of Unite for Europe. “This fast-track bill will create a lot of emotion and anger in the country that things are being rushed through.” A march against the Iraq war in 2003 is thought to be the largest in modern times, attracting 750,000 people according to police estimates and up to 2 million according to organisers at the time. In contrast, the largest anti-Brexit march to date attracted an estimated crowd of 50,000 on 2 July, shortly after the EU referendum, and there have been two smaller marches in August and September. “The idea is to try to make this the biggest march the capital, or country, has ever seen,” said French, who pointed out that there were 6 or 7 million voters in London alone, some 70% of whom had opposed Brexit.\\n“Right now, Theresa May is focused entirely on the 52% and forgetting the 48%,” he said. “We aim to impress on government the strength of feeling about the government rushing this through with no sense of what it will do to the country.” After the supreme court ruled this week that MPs must be consulted first, the government has announced a swift timetable, with just five days of debate scheduled in the Commons and 137 words of proposed legislation.\\nBut the “Stop Brexit” protest organisers are undeterred by the possibility that article 50 may have already been invoked by 25 March and say it underlines their concern that the government is ignoring growing concern about the consequences of leaving the EU. The date of the planned demonstration is also the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which founded the European Economic Community, and organisers hope it will attract a broad spectrum of EU citizens and young people who were unable to vote in the referendum. “This is a march for everyone: people who voted against, who were wavering, or perhaps those who wanted to leave but are now finding out that abandoning the single market and customs union is not what they voted for,” said French. Resistance is also growing in Westminster, where a number of Labour MPs are preparing to defy a three-line whip from party leaders and vote against the government bill, while Conservative peers are among an active group in the Lords considering what role it should play in what is expected to be a tightly fought amendment process. But politicians advising the march have stressed the importance of also showing grassroots opposition to an overly harsh or hasty Brexit. Organisers have been particularly buoyed by the success of last weekend’s women’s marches against Donald Trump, which were seen as symbolising a new spirit of peaceful protest and defiance against the forces of political nationalism.\\n“We were very encouraged by the Trump march and also by the atmosphere and enthusiasm from a cross-section of society,” added French, a professional singer who has no previous involvement in politics before the referendum. “It shows that there is a still a need out there for people to gather and that it is important to get out there and be heard.” Organisers are working with the Metropolitan police, Greater London Authority and Westminster council on a route for the march that will likely start in Park Lane before heading to Piccadilly, Trafalgar Square and end in Parliament Square with a series of as-yet unannounced speakers. There are also a series of marches planned against NHS cuts on 4 March, which it is hoped will help unite political opposition against government policies. Organisers of the Stop Brexit march defended their decision to hold a single event in London, citing the logistical challenge since launching the planned march on 30 December. So far largely organised on Facebook, they are currently crowd funding and seeking volunteer marshals. They say that they want to maximise the visual impact by staging the largest march possible. “It is vital that it is in London because we are marching on parliament; our message is to parliament,” said French. A small counter protest is planned by Brexit supporters in Whitehall.', 'The Scottish secretary has admitted there would be serious consequences if the UK government failed to win Holyrood’s backing for its final Brexit deal. David Mundell said he expected Holyrood would be allowed to vote on whether it consented to the so-called great reform bill with which the UK will formally quit the EU, repatriating substantial powers to Westminster and the UK’s three devolved governments. The vote on a legislative consent motion (LCM) does not give the Scottish parliament a binding veto allowing MSPs to block the bill at Westminster – a fact accepted by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and her cabinet.\\nBut if Westminster were to press ahead after Holyrood had voted it down, that would set up a fierce political battle between the UK government and the pro-independence Scottish National party and Scottish Greens, both of whom want a second independence vote. With 63 SNP MSPs leaving her two short of an overall Holyrood majority, Sturgeon needs just the Scottish Greens’ six MSPs to vote down the LCM, pushing the UK and Scotland into a confrontation that could further fuel support for Scottish independence and a snap referendum.\\nWith conflicts looming between the two governments over Holyrood’s power to vote on the much shorter bill released on Thursday to trigger article 50, Mundell admitted he was worried about the bigger task of agreeing exactly what new powers Scotland would get. “I think there are really big issues that will be in the great repeal bill, around powers for this parliament, and whether we have a hole in our law because the body of European law hasn’t been adopted,” he told reporters in Edinburgh. “Not agreeing to the great repeal bill would have very significant consequences. But my focus will be to work with the parliament here, with committees, to get that agreement.” That bill could repatriate sweeping new powers to Holyrood, including control over farm subsidies, fisheries and employment rules, as well as enshrining EU legislation into Scots law. Mundell said criminal justice powers, including over consumer rights, were “the most obvious ones”. These would be likely to increase Holyrood’s spending and its autonomy from the rest of the UK, increasing the chances of a turf war with other UK cabinet ministers and the Treasury over how much EU power and financing Scotland should inherit. Tensions between the two governments escalated further after the meeting with Mundell. Sturgeon’s chief spokesman said their ministers had learned “zero, zilch and nothing” about the new powers the UK government would offer Scotland. “It was a fairly pointless meeting,” he said. Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister, said he was deeply disappointed that nothing substantive had emerged given that Mundell had requested the meeting to discuss the great repeal bill. “There was no offer, no guarantee even that current devolved powers, presently exercised through EU membership, will be coming back to Scotland. There should be no UK government power grab,” Russell said. UK government sources said Russell was overstating the purpose of the meeting. One official said the UK government was at the start of “a long and complex conversation about the repatriation of powers. Today’s meeting was not about horse-trading powers or making promises. It was to begin a conversation about the best way to proceed in all this”. Sturgeon was preparing for a more immediate showdown with the UK government over the new European Union (notification of withdrawal) bill published on Thursday by the UK Brexit secretary, David Davis. She is to table a legislative consent motion to Holyrood asking for it to reject the bill despite uncertainty over whether Holyrood has the power to do so. The UK supreme court’s 11 judges ruled unanimously on Tuesday that the UK’s devolved parliaments had no legal power to hold LCM votes on EU and international treaty legislation such as an article 50 bill, because those powers were clearly and explicitly reserved for Westminster. They said that LCMs were a political convention, known as the Sewell convention after the Labour peer who devised it in 1998, and not a legally binding constitutional right. But the court appeared to contradict that by then stating that the courts had no power to decide what the scope or remit of that convention was because it was a political agreement. The judges added that the article 50 process clearly changed and affected the powers of the devolved parliament. Sturgeon’s officials said that meant an LCM was permissable under Holyrood’s standing orders – a view rejected by Mundell. “I don’t hold the view that the bill we published this morning should be the subject of that process because it is simply a notification that we wish to enter into negotiations to leave the EU, and that is a reserved matter,” he said. Holyrood officials said Ken Macintosh, its presiding officer, had not yet decided whether that LCM on article 50 could go ahead and would only decide after he had seen the UK government’s article 50 bill and the wording of Sturgeon’s motion.', 'Senior European politicians have suggested Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump on Friday could sour negotiations over Britain’s departure from the European Union. Speaking before the prime minister and new president’s meeting in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon, the French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron claimed that Britain could become subservient to the US.\\n“Britain lived in an equilibrium with Europe,” Macron told France Culture radio. “But now it is becoming a vassal state, meaning it is becoming the junior partner of the United States.” Macron added that he now feared the EU could no longer rank the US as a reliable partner in safeguarding western values. “What’s happening today with Trump’s first statements and choices is extremely serious and worrying,” he said. “It’s firstly a choice that it will be an America that provokes ... an America that destabilises things that have been built for decades. “It signifies that the US will no longer be in a position to co-organise globalisation and be the world’s policeman with the European Union. The unpredictable choices, the outbursts and the inward-looking United States of Trump no longer guarantees Europe’s security.” Meanwhile the European commission’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is understood to have privately expressed concern at the potential for the prime minister’s visit to the Oval Office to further damage relations with EU member states.\\nAny evidence that Britain had started negotiating a deal would be likely to prompt calls for the European commission to investigate, in a move likely to harden attitudes on both sides of the coming article 50 negotiations. A European commission spokesman declined to comment on Barnier’s private views. He repeated the organisation’s official position that the UK is not legally permitted to negotiate on the detail of future trade deals while still under treaty obligations with the EU. One senior source in the commission said: “Like everyone else, we will all be watching.” May’s visit follows a series of contacts between London and Washington since Trump won the election in November. Her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, met members of the new president’s team in December and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, visited Washington this month to discuss a potential bilateral trade deal.\\nOn Thursday, Trump said: “I’m meeting with [May] tomorrow. I don’t have my commerce secretary. They want to talk trade, so I’ll have to handle it myself. Which is OK.” However, asked before a meeting of EU member state finance ministers in Brussels whether May intended to open negotiations with Trump on a trade deal, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, insisted the UK would abide by its obligations to wait until it withdrew from the EU. He said: “Britain remains a fully engaged member of the European Union. I am here today for discussions with my finance minister colleagues. “We will continue to take a full part and we will continue to abide by the rules, the regulations and the laws of the European Union for so long as we are members. So of course we want to strengthen our trade ties with the very many trade partners we have around the world, but we are very mindful of our obligations under the treaty and we will follow them precisely.”', 'Britain’s first nuclear power station in two decades will be delayed by a government decision to quit Europe’s atomic power treaty, experts have warned. Ministers revealed on Thursday that Brexit would involve the UK leaving Euratom, which promotes research into nuclear power and uniform safety standards. The news poses problems for the Hinkley Point C station in Somerset, while raising questions over safety inspection regimes and the UK’s future participation in nuclear fusion research.\\n“Leaving Euratom is a lose-lose for everyone. For nuclear proponents, the industry becomes less competitive – and for nuclear critics, safety regulation diminishes,” said Dr Paul Dorfman of the Energy Institute at University College London. Referring to Hinkley and other nuclear projects in the pipeline, he said: “The UK nuclear industry is critically dependent on European goods and services in the nuclear supply chain and their specialist nuclear skills. Leaving Euratom will inevitably increas nuclear costs and will mean further delays. EDF, which is building the Hinkley project and hopes to construct other plants, has told MPs that “ideally” the UK would stay in the treaty, as it provided a framework for complying with international standards for handling nuclear material. Without mentioning Hinkley, the French state-owned company also warned that restrictions on the movement of people because of Brexit could delay delivery of new energy infrastructure. Antony Froggatt, a research fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “Outside of Euratom and the single market, the movement of nuclear fuel, equipment and trained staff will be more complicated.” He noted that because the UK was a supporter of nuclear power, Brexit would affect the balance of nuclear policies in the EU, where Germany, Italy and even strongly pro-nuclear France had taken steps in recent years to reduce their reliance on atomic power. Vince Zabielski, a nuclear energy specialist at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, said: “If the UK leaves Euratom before new standalone nuclear cooperation treaties are negotiated with France and the US, current new build projects will be placed on hold while those standalone treaties are negotiated.” Other lawyers questioned why the government had decided to quit Euratom and in the manner it had done so, in the explanatory notes accompany the article 50 bill. “There doesn’t seem to have been any real explanation as to why, because we are going towards the unknown at great speed. Legally we don’t have to [leave Euratom because the UK is leaving the EU],” said Jonathan Leech, a senior lawyer and nuclear expert at Prospect Law. “At the moment, the UK standing on the world nuclear stage is predicated on a series of cooperation agreements, and those we have the benefit of from being a member of Euratom, and the few bilateral agreements are based on Euratom, too. Take that away and you have no basis for international nuclear cooperation.” He said quitting Euratom would create unnecessary uncertainty for new nuclear power and research into fusion power, a cleaner alternative to nuclear fission in which the UK has been a world leader for decades. Although the short-term future of the Joint European Torus, a nuclear fusion research centre in Oxfordshire, is guaranteed until 2018, last year’s referendum result and the withdrawal from Euratom puts its longer-term future in doubt. Bernard Bigot, the director of the ITER project, a huge international undertaking to develop nuclear fusion in the south of France, said he believed the UK could still participate in ITER even when it leaves the treaty. “There are several ways for the UK to pursue its participation to ITER within the Brexit policy, if there is political will of the UK and the EU. This could occur either within or outside of the Euratom arrangement,” he said. Leaving Euratom is likely to also add to the workload of the UK’s nuclear regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, which is busy assessing designs for Britain’s first Chinese-designed nuclear power plant. “The main burden of the UK leaving Euratom will be the need for it to cover its nuclear non-proliferation safeguards commitment and for this it will have to either set up a separate, independent agency or bring these treaty responsibilities into the Office for Nuclear Regulation,” said John Large, a nuclear consultant. EDF said it had made its view clear on Euratom, and rejected the suggestion that the UK’s withdrawal from the treaty would delay Hinkley Point C. A government spokeswoman said the UK wanted to see a continuity of cooperation and standards. “We remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry. Our aim is clear – we want to maintain our mutually successful civil nuclear cooperation with the EU,” she said.', 'The pressure on the pound from Britain’s vote to leave the EU is stoking inflation, denting household finances and putting a brake on spending, according to a Guardian analysis. Official figures this week are expected to confirm the economy enjoyed a strong finish to 2016 as companies and consumers continued to shrug off the shock of the Brexit vote. But signs of a spending slowdown, corporate jitters around the triggering of article 50 and rising prices point to a more challenging growth outlook in 2017. Seven months on from the referendum, the Guardian’s monthly tracker of economic news shows the weaker pound is being felt in the real economy more keenly than ever, as it raises the cost of imports such as energy and food and that gets passed on to consumers as higher prices in the shops.\\nTo gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for January shows a worse than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were better than expected and unemployment was as expected. Inflation was higher than economists had forecast, hitting its highest level for more than two years in December. Writing in the Guardian, a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), Andrew Sentance, said two factors pointed to economic growth losing momentum: a slowdown in employment and rising inflation. “For now, consumer spending and strong global growth are supporting the UK economy – and we have yet to see the negative impact on investment which many forecasters are expecting in 2017,” said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC. “But the signals from the labour market are consistent with slower economic growth this year driven by heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote. In 2017 and 2018, we should expect to see economic growth of close to 1.5%, below the 2% which the UK has achieved over the seven years of recovery so far.” Among the more downbeat measures in the latest dashboard, the housing market lost momentum at the close of 2016, with property price gains easing and fewer sales. The UK’s trade position deteriorated further on the latest official measures as a jump in imports eclipsed a pick-up in exports. And in a worrying omen for an economy reliant on consumer spending, retail sales fell over the crucial Christmas period. The public finances were in a slightly worse state than expected for December, but revisions to November figures improved the government’s chances of meeting its borrowing target for the full year. On a brighter note, surveys from the manufacturing, construction and services sectors signal they all managed to expand again in December, beating economists’ forecasts and boding well for official GDP figures due on Thursday. That first snapshot of fourth-quarter economic growth is expected to show the economy expanded by 0.5%, almost matching the third quarter’s robust growth of 0.6%. In the jobs market, unemployment remains low and wage growth is outpacing inflation, for now. But in a sign firms are growing more wary of hiring new staff, the number of people in employment has dropped and experts warn that firms’ rising costs will limit their ability and willingness to award pay rises this year. It remains to be seen whether December’s unexpected drop in retail volumes will prove to be a blip or evidence of a squeeze on consumers. Publishing the sales figures, the Office for National Statistics warned against reading too much into one month alone. It instead highlighted quarterly data showing retail sales grew in the final three months of 2016. Reports on Christmas trading from retailers themselves meanwhile were largely positive, with some noting an early boost in November from Black Friday sales events. But as inflation starts to bite and the jobs market shows signs of cooling, economists warn household budgets will deteriorate this year and retailers will struggle to keep sales rising. The industry itself is cautious in its outlook, with the British Retail Consortium flagging “growing inflationary pressures and persisting economic and political uncertainty”.\\nThe Bank of England governor said this month that consumers appeared to have looked through Brexit worries to carry on spending. But in his first speech of 2017, Mark Carney also highlighted that the brisk pace of spending had been accompanied by a rise in household borrowing. The Bank, which presents its latest outlook for the economy next week, expects pressures on consumers to rise further this year as a weak currency stokes inflation. The pound’s sharp moves over the last month have underscored its vulnerability to government announcements on the Brexit process. Sterling skidded to a three-month low against the dollar before Theresa May’s key Brexit speech as news leaked out that she would take the UK out of Europe’s single market. It then recovered as she confirmed any deal would be put to a vote but fell on this week’s supreme court ruling that MPs and peers must give their consent before the government can trigger article 50 and formally initiate Brexit. David Blanchflower, also a former member of the MPC, said the pound was being buffeted by politics. “The pound has been responsive to the May government’s many self-inflicted wounds,” said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. “The pound moves down every time the prospect of a cliff-edge Brexit rears its ugly head. It strengthens on the possibility that the economic Neanderthals are not going to have their way.” On stock markets, the pound’s loss has been the FTSE 100’s gain as the index continues to be flattered by a weak currency. The index hit a fresh record peak earlier this month and broke a near 20-year record for its longest run of closing highs. The drop in the pound has boosted the earnings of many of the companies in the FTSE 100 that report in dollars and it is up 13% since the 23 June referendum.', '“Nnnnng. Urggggh. Bleugggh.” Roughly translated, this was David Davis’s way of saying he had lost his voice after being forced to spend two hours giving a statement to the House of Commons two days ago, following the government’s defeat in the supreme court, and was somewhat peeved to discover he was now required to answer Brexit departmental questions. Hilary Benn, the chairman of the Brexit select committee, was the first to test the Brexit secretary’s voice and patience by asking who would arbitrate in future trade disputes once we had withdrawn from the European court of justice. “Nnnnng. Urggggh. Bleugggh,” said Davis. This appeared to mean that in the post-Brexit world order, everything would be sweetness and light, and if, in the unlikely event that there should be any minor disagreements, they could be patched up with the help of a relationship mediation counsellor. Dream on. “I’d like to thank the minister for introducing a white paper,” said the Tory MP Anna Soubry. This time “Nnnnng. Urggggh. Bleugggh” meant precisely “Nnnnng. Urggggh. Bleugggh.” Just after the EU referendum, Davis was one of the few Brexiters to say he thought there should be a white paper on the government’s plans for leaving the EU, but had since been forced to publicly disagree with himself as Theresa May wanted to keep parliamentary scrutiny to a minimum. Now that Theresa had decided to publicly disagree with herself at prime minister’s questions the day before, after realising there were rather too many on her benches who didn’t see things the same way, Davis was put into the rather awkward situation of being forced to agree with himself without making his boss look any more foolish than she already had. Under the circumstances, “Nnnnng. Urggggh. Bleugggh” was just about the only printable response. Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister, wanted to know some more specifics about the white paper. In particular, if there was any chance of it being published before the Commons had a chance to debate the government’s 137-word bill on triggering article 50. “Nnnnng. Urggggh. Bleugggh.” These grunts were accompanied by a shrug that suggested the whole thing was well above his pay grade. Davis was pleased that Theresa had seen sense, but he had no control over timings. That depended on whether she decided just to cut and paste bits of her speech into the white paper or if she gave the whole thing a bit more thought. On balance, he’d rather she thought about it, as parts of her speech had been sketchy to say the least, but it was more than his life was worth to voice an opinion. And that was nearly that. The hardline Tory Eurosceptics had kindly chosen not to voice their irritation over the white paper – nothing to be gained by shooting the messenger and all that – and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was still unable to think of a decent question. Primarily because Labour has yet to decide on a coherent response to Brexit. Starmer settled for asking Davis to keep parliament updated every two months or so. “Nnnnng. Urggggh. Bleugggh,” said the Brexit secretary. If only it were just every two months, he might be able to come up with something more coherent. The only time Davis found his voice was when Labour’s Chi Onwurah brought up Donald Trump’s enthusiasm for a bit of selective torturing. On this, the Brexit secretary was unequivocal. At no time would he ever sanction waterboarding EU officials. Not even if the Brexit negotiations became deadlocked. However, he didn’t say whether British negotiators would be happy to use information that US intelligence officers had obtained from the EU under torture. It was possible the prime minister may clarify that one with the president on Friday afternoon. Though somehow he doubted that she would dare bring it up in conversation. Some questions were just too awkward for a special relationship.', 'Hadley, you’ve written on Brexit elsewhere in the paper, but not in your style column. Why is that? Robert, by email You’re right, Robert! I have stayed away from Brexit in this column because that would mean looking at what it means for the fashion industry, and the answer to that is, well, no one knows. Confusion over Brexit, how strange – don’t see that in any other industry, do you? On the one hand, thanks to the plummeting pound (boo!) luxury goods are now cheaper for tourists (er, yay?). So, for example, a Louis Vuitton Speedy bag is currently about $200 cheaper in the UK for US visitors – although I wouldn’t exactly count this as sticking it to the elites, as the leave campaign repeatedly claimed voting its way would achieve. But, someone at the back bellows, this will help the British industry as a whole. A surge of tourism! Bringing in money! To the economy! Yay! All right, little Mikey Gove, try to calm yourself. Maybe go and have an ice cream out the back, but not Ben & Jerry’s because we can’t afford that at the moment. So some tourists might spend more at Harrods, but let’s look at what this means on a more granular level, as proper columnists would put it. Yes, British exports will be cheaper, but only if they don’t rely on imported goods and manufacturing. And, as much as it might pain certain members of the Tory party to hear this, pretty much every British fashion brand relies on those two things. This isn’t because British fashion labels are trying to chisel their own nation’s economy with cheap Chinese knockoffs and eastern European workers, but rather because it is simply not possible for most fashion labels to be entirely manufactured in this country, relying instead on European factories and skilled labour. So the net result of Brexit on all this is that British brands will become much more expensive for British customers, as companies find their costs going up and their workforce depleting. Um, yay sovereignty?\\nAlso, let’s look at British fashion as a whole. Now, what this country’s fashion industry has always lacked in terms in of infrastructure, slickness and big-brand money, it has made up for in creativity. At least, that’s what those who work in it love to tell themselves. OK, we don’t have Dior or Calvin Klein, but look! We have the best fashion schools in the world, where the best students from around the world come to study. And look! We also produce some of the most acclaimed designers who then work at the biggest labels around Europe, such as Phoebe Philo (Chloé, Céline), Stella McCartney (Chloé), Alexander McQueen (Givenchy), John Galliano (Givenchy, Dior, Maison Margiela), etc, etc. Yay, Britain! But how, exactly, will this continue to work if it’s harder for foreign students to come here and European companies have to sort out complex visas when they hire British workers? Oh stop worrying, says the leave camp, relying, perhaps, on British fashion’s much-vaunted creativity to get around these little problems. Finally, I’d say the ultimate problem is bigger and more amorphous than visas. So much in fashion is about image and association: buy a New York label and you’re buying into the fantasy of Manhattan dynamism and power lunches; an Italian label suggests dolce vita glamour; French labels promise chic. British labels, more than any other country’s, play on such national stereotypes: ideas of heritage (the tweed, the crown), punkish rebellion and, most of all, a kind of gonzo creativity in which Britain has always taken pride. But what image, Britain, do we have now, in our post-Brexit era on the global stage? I’d wager it has a lot less to do with enviable sovereignty and more about a silly little country that cut off its nose to spite everyone’s face. Is that the sort of look people want to buy into? Look, as even Boris Johnson would almost certainly admit if you caught him in a rare moment of honesty, Brexit has far bigger problems facing it than how it will affect the fashion industry. But all of these issues underline the central question of Brexit, which is: what kind of country do we want to live in? Because, at the risk of tipping into pomposity, fashion encapsulates fantasy and aspirational self-image. So when a country’s fashion industry looks like it will struggle to achieve this, on both a practical and mental level, it’s perhaps time to take a good long look in the mirror again.\\nWhat to make of Bob Dylan winning the Nobel? Marcus, by email Sure, Dylan knows how to write a line or ten million. But as singer Tracey Thorn quite rightly tweeted last week, “So much Bob adulation is bound up in the fact that he looked so cool,” which is why, she continued, even more rightly, “Paul Simon loses out, because fewer iconic photos.” Truer words were rarely ever tweeted. Sure, Dylan’s fine, but, I’ll be honest, he’s never written anything that has struck me as purely poetical as, say, The Boy in the Bubble, The Boxer or even just the opening lines of Graceland. Also, Simon never wrote any doggerel as tedious as Blowin’ in the Wind. And I don’t see anyone saying he should get a Nobel. I’m not trying to detract from Dylan (OK, maybe I am, just a little), but isn’t it funny how even the mighty Nobel committee is as swayed by appearances as anyone else? Because Bob’s look – which can be summed up as “Jewish beatnik who pawned his coat” – is undoubtedly as much a part of his legend as his songs.

The bill, containing just two clauses and only 137 words long, will be granted five days of time in the Commons, the government announced, prompting concern from some Labour MPs that it could not receive proper scrutiny in such a period. Devised after the government this week lost its supreme court case on whether it could trigger article 50 without the approval of parliament, the European Union (notification of withdrawal) bill states as its aim to “confer power on the prime minister to notify, under article 50(2) of the treaty on European Union, the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the EU”.\\nGranting this power to the prime minister would have effect “despite any provision made by or under the European Communities Act 1972 or any other enactment”, the bill says. In a statement with the bill, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, said he trusted that parliament “will respect the decision taken by the British people and pass the legislation quickly”. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, confirmed he would seek to oblige his MPs to back the bill, a decision that seems set to cause considerable opposition within the party. Labour later tabled seven planned amendments to the bill, one of which would guarantee a “meaningful vote in parliament” on any final deal. Another amendment would be to guarantee the protection of workers’ rights and securing “full tariff- and impediment-free access” to the EU’s single market. The other five amendments are: to ensure the Brexit secretary, David Davis, reports on progress to the Commons at least every two months; guaranteeing the rights of foreign EU nationals living in the UK; obliging regular consultation with the devolved governments; require regular impact assessments on the effects of leaving the single market; and to oblige the government to keep all existing EU tax avoidance and evasion measures. The final amendment is targeted at the government’s threat that if the UK does not get a sufficiently good deal from the EU it will walk away and shift the economy towards low regulation and tax. The party will also support two more amendments, drafted by the MP Melanie Onn, connected to protecting workers’ rights. The amendments would “significantly improve the government’s bill”, said the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, by ensuring proper scrutiny and a final say for MPs. “Labour’s amendments will also seek to ensure the prime minister delivers on her key objectives, including tariff- and impediment-free access to the single market, and there is no drop in workers’ rights,” Starmer said. “We will also vigorously oppose any plans to reduce powers to tackle tax avoidance or evasion.” Shortly before the bill was published, David Lidington, the leader of the Commons, told MPs they would have five days to debate the issue. The second reading debate would take place over two days, on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, he said. The key second reading vote will be on Wednesday. Parliament will sit until midnight on the Tuesday, Lidington said. The following week, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday will be set aside for the committee and report stages and for the third reading. The bill will then go to the Lords. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, whose MPs will vote against the bill, called it “short and not sweet”. He said: “Take back control was a mantra of the leave campaign but this government’s extreme reluctance to involve parliament in this process has instead been an affront to parliamentary sovereignty and democracy.” News of the rapid timetable prompted anger from some Labour MPs, with Ben Bradshaw calling the amount of days set aside “a disgrace”. David Lammy said the bill was the “most important decision taken for generations” and allowing five days “shows contempt for parliamentary sovereignty”.\\nLidington rejected the criticism. Asked by another Labour MP, Chris Leslie, why the time set aside was an eighth of the amount of time used to debate the bill introducing the 1992 Maastricht treaty, Lidington said this was “synthetic rage”. “There is no comparison between previous bills that sought to ratify EU treaties which had a direct impact on many different aspects of UK law, and a two-clause bill of which a single clause is a substantive one, which is in entirely to give authority to the prime minister to trigger an article 50 process and begin a negotiation,” he said. Lord Pannick QC, who represented Gina Miller, the lead claimant in the supreme court case, said the bill would serve the government’s purposes. He commented: “The bill does what is legally required. We shall see whether it also satisfies political requirements.” Earlier on Thursday, Davis refused to guarantee that the parallel government white paper on the exit process, which was announced on Wednesday, would be published before the article 50 bill had been debated in the Commons. “It will be as expeditious as we can be,” Davis said during departmental questions in the Commons when asked about the timing. “It takes time to do. But we won’t waste time in producing it for the house.”', 'Britain is in the early stages of an unfolding catastrophe that is going to transform the country into an unpleasant, illiberal and inward-looking island. The US, now set to follow suit under Donald Trump, can only make matters worse. All Out War is the title of Tim Shipman’s excellent account of the referendum that led to the UK’s part in this wretched prospect (there seems to be no one to whom he hasn’t spoken and whose motives he does not pretty accurately portray and understand), and it is a war that has continued well beyond 23 June. It was also winnable by Remain five months ago, as Shipman tells it, had Remain taken its cause as seriously and as passionately as Leave. The deep forces at work could still have been successively challenged. But in acts of self-indulgence bordering on decadence, both the Conservative and Labour leaderships put their party interest before the nation’s – and 600,000 votes that could so easily have\\xa0been in the Remain ledger ended up in Leave’s.\\nNonetheless, that so many small misjudgments consistently and cumulatively worked to Leave’s advantage was no accident. The outcome was the logical conclusion of failing to confront the steady rise of Euroscepticism over the previous decades: resistance required the liberal centre to use political capital to stand up to what is now obviously a malign alliance of obsessed constitutional nationalists and far rightwing populists. They came from the margins to win because they so successfully capitalised on the real, unaddressed grievances of the millions left behind in contemporary Britain. The EU, charged the sceptics, was the cause of their pain. Too few had the bottle or statesmanship to make the counter case: that it was not immigration that was the principal cause of their grievance, but rather homemade – and reversible – economic and social policies of neglect and transferring ever more risk to those least able to bear it. Far from being the problem, the EU’s social model, as one of the few guarantors of worker rights and entitlements while keeping markets open, was part of the solution. Nor was there sufficient challenge to the way the rightwing press increasingly and flagrantly used its formidable and biased campaigning power. It’s what happens to countries in irreversible decline. We are all reaping the consequences.\\nShipman convincingly marshals much fresh evidence to prove what we already half-knew. David Cameron felt the only way he could hold his party together, prevent further defections to Ukip in the year before the 2015 general election and make a fist of fighting it with some semblance of unity was to promise a referendum – with all its political and economic risks, not least to his own career and standing. His comrade in arms, George Osborne, was against. The referendum, thought Osborne, would split their party and there was too high a risk of losing, with incalculable economic consequences. Osborne will be proved right on both counts: but having lost the argument, he chose to go down loyally with the Cameron ship rather than declare his independence and resign. He is paying a deservedly high price for deserting his\\xa0principles on a matter so existentially important. This putting of personal and party interest first was pervasive, as two telling passages in Shipman’s book reveal – the fateful decision of first Michael Gove and then Boris Johnson to join Leave, and the policy of masterly disengagement of Jeremy Corbyn, a puppet in the hands of shadow chancellor John McDonnell and chief of staff Seumas Milne. If both episodes had played out differently, Remain could have carried the day, but given the prevailing political atmosphere neither could be prevented. Thus if Cameron, who had mistakenly believed that loyalty and friendship in the case of Gove and cool assessment of the arguments alongside loyalty in the case of Johnson would keep both inside the Remain camp, had been prepared to be ruthless with both in the cause of winning, he might have blunted the worst of the impact of Leave now having one intellectual and one charismatic leader. But the same overweening desire to hold the Tory party together that had prompted the referendum in the first place stayed his hand. He knew that most of those who had stuck under his banner were there less because of conviction than a sullen belief that the costs of leaving were too high – hardly a platform on which to be tough with the Tory leavers. Sajid Javid, writes Shipman, only plumped for Remain after Osborne walked him personally through a slideshow presentation of the economic consequences. In his heart he was a leaver. Euroscepticism has rotted the Tory party from within. The compromises by Labour, a much more convinced European party, are harder to understand. Yet, in testimony to the depths to which it has fallen, first Harriet Harman as acting leader and then Corbyn made winning harder than it needed to be. Harman conspired with Tory sceptic backbenchers to make the terms of the referendum as tough for the Remain side as she could, wanting short-term headlines embarrassing the government rather than thinking through the consequences. Worse, neither she nor Corbyn were prepared to form a cross-party coalition and make common cause. As a result, Remain become a Tory front led by a second-term prime minister whose appeal was fading, while Labour’s campaign, throttled by McDonnell’s and Milne’s obstructions and half-heartedness, and in which Corbyn connived, was never vigorous enough to compensate. And as Shipman demonstrates, Remain could not afford such weaknesses. The official Leave campaign, focused by Dominic Cummings around his deadly message – Take Back Control – and led by Johnson and Gove, was already formidable. But it took the Bad Boys of Brexit, as Arron Banks calls the unofficial Leave team he funded so generously (essentially Ukip), to take the risks and rally the disillusioned white working-class vote. Banks sees Farage as a political genius who knew all along that immigration would be the clincher, whatever the hated Tory defector Douglas Carswell thought – and in speaking the unsayable could draw and enthral crowds like no other. Owen Bennett’s The Brexit Club, meanwhile, offers a riveting inside account of the rows between the two wings of Leave over strategy and the fight to win the official designation. He manages to chronicle every meeting, with Farage’s scorn for the Tory Eurosceptic “aristocracy” and growing detestation of Carswell a running theme. But in the end the divisions worked to Leave’s advantage. It had power on the streets of disadvantaged Britain courtesy of Farage, and power in the media and intellectually courtesy of Johnson and Gove. The liberal centre, derided as the establishment, could not muster the matching energy, conviction, unity and passion to fight back.

She will now try to push it through the Commons and the Lords as soon as possible, possibly within two weeks. Government whips will need to allow enough debating time for MPs to feel they have been given a chance to scrutinise and amend the bill, but ultimately will want the legislation to be passed quickly to stick to May’s self-imposed deadline of March for invoking Brexit. The vast majority of the party will vote straightforwardly for Brexit at all stages of the passage of the bill. Only Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, has said he will vote against, with most MPs happy that May has now conceded on the point of publishing a white paper. But backbench Tory rebels – such as Nicky Morgan, for example – could potentially back or lay amendments that try to tie May to a softer Brexit. Possible amendments could include seeking full tariff-free access to the single market or giving MPs a vote at the end of the process with the option of sending May back to Brussels to get a better deal. Labour – 229 seats Jeremy Corbyn’s position is to ask MPs to vote in favour of triggering article 50, although he will seek to amend the bill to secure protections for workers and more parliamentary scrutiny along the way. However, a number of frontbenchers, especially those from remain-supporting constituencies, will find it difficult to do that. It is possible they will have to resign if Corbyn imposes a three-line whip as expected, or he may turn a blind eye to any rebels, depending on who they are and their reasons for voting against. MPs may vote different ways at different stages of the process. About 20 to 30 will probably vote against the bill at first reading, and dozens more could abstain. The final result will probably depend on whether any amendments pass or the government concedes any more issues as it has with the white paper. SNP - 54 seats The SNP plans to vote against triggering article 50 and will lay as many as 50 amendments, including an assurance that May will seek the full agreement of the joint ministerial council of the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Liberal Democrats - nine seats The party’s collective position is to vote against article 50 unless there is a promise of a second referendum on the eventual deal. It will also seek to amend the Brexit bill. A three-line whip will be imposed but it is not certain that all the party’s MPs will stick to the policy, given that three did not vote against invoking article 50 in December. DUP - eight seats The party supports Brexit and will be likely to back the government, effectively increasing May’s majority in the House of Commons. Ukip - one seat Douglas Carswell, the party’s only MP, will undoubtedly vote for Brexit. In fact, he has suggested the Commons or Lords should be dissolved if either takes the highly unlikely step of blocking article 50. Outside parliament, Ukip’s leader, Paul Nuttall, will probably try to present Labour as interfering with the Brexit process as he attempts to unseat the incumbent party in the leave-voting constituency of Stoke-on-Trent Central in a byelection. Greens - one seat Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, will vote against triggering article 50. The positioning could boost the party’s chances against Labour in seats such as Norwich South (held by the shadow business secretary Clive Lewis, who is thinking of defying the whip). Plaid Cymru - three seats The party’s three MPs oppose triggering article 50 and want to amend the bill to make sure the devolved administrations approve the final deal. UUP - two seats The UUP’s two MPs have confirmed that they will both be voting for the UK to leave the EU. Independent Unionists - one seat Sylvia Hermon has been strongly pro-EU in the past but her intention is unknown. SDLP - three seats The three SDLP members will vote against triggering article 50.', 'Theresa May’s government is facing inter-departmental squabbles, concerns over staffing levels and “big challenges” drawing up legislation as it attempts to implement a Brexit strategy, analysis by Whitehall’s leading thinktank has found. “Turf wars” between key departments led by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox have been a distraction, wasting time and energy, the Institute for Government (IfG) report said. The analysis, drawing on official data, also found that some of the departments likely to have the heaviest workloads because of Brexit have been badly hit by budget and staff cuts.\\nThe IfG’s Whitehall Monitor criticised May’s decision to create a new Brexit ministry under Davis and the Department for International Trade under Fox, alongside Johnson’s Foreign Office, but acknowledged the situation was now appearing to “settle down”. With the three departments settling in, “time and energy was inevitably wasted in turf wars, fragmentation, incoherence and a lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities”, the report said. It suggested a better option might have been to support a cabinet minister for Brexit with a unit in the Cabinet Office – an echo of previous comments by former cabinet secretary Gus O’Donnell. Some of the departments facing the biggest challenges around Brexit have experienced “deep staff and budget cuts”, the report noted. Staff levels at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is affected by 1,200 EU laws, have fallen by more than a third since 2010, with a reduction in its day-to-day spending of more than a fifth since 2011-12. The Home Office, which will have responsibility for the new immigration system being drawn up after Brexit, has had its budget reduced by nearly a fifth and lost about a tenth of its staff. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, announced up to £412m extra funding for the Foreign Office and the two new departments, but the IfG report said it was unclear whether this would be enough and that there were no details of extra money to help other departments. The report added: “Drafting the great repeal bill – which aims to transpose EU law into UK law where practical – is also proving a more complex challenge than expected, which could further add to departments’ workloads. “Departments thus face big challenges in planning for and beyond Brexit, many doing so with fewer staff and less money, while needing to carry out relatively unfamiliar tasks.” The report also criticised the “patchy” approach to transparency in Whitehall, singling out the Home Office under May as one of the worst-performing departments in responding to information requests from MPs and the public. Only the Ministry of Justice and Department for Education had worse records. “This isn’t exactly encouraging for those who had hoped that the new prime minister would build on the coalition’s open government initiatives,” the report noted. Whitehall as a whole has become less transparent in its responses to freedom of information requests over the past six years, the report claimed. At the start of the coalition, government departments withheld information in full in response to 25% of requests; by the second quarter of 2016, this had risen to 40%, the report said.', 'Citigroup has set out 25 criteria to weigh up which financial centre in the European Union will house the new operation it expects to set up as a result of Brexit. The US bank, which employs 9,000 people in the UK, has been in discussions with the authorities in Ireland, Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands as potential locations for the new operation it is preparing in anticipation of losing access to the remaining 27 members of the EU once the UK leaves the trading bloc. James Cowles, who runs Citi’s operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said a decision would be made in the first half of the year. He told a conference in Dublin he thought many other financial firms with London operations would be working to a similar timescale.\\nThe City is rife with speculation that the triggering of article 50 – which is planned for March and will signal the formal negotiations to leave the EU – will lead to major US, Japan and Swiss banks in the UK implementing their Brexit contingency plans. The race is on among financial centres in the EU to lure any business lost by the City in the Brexit fallout. Cowles said the criteria would be used to help the bank, which employs 19,000 staff across the EU, decide which would be the ideal location to keep operating smoothly after Brexit. Among the factors that will be considered are the complexities of the legal system, local infrastructure and each city’s capacity to provide suitable housing and schools for the employees and families being relocated. “We will be making a decision in the first half of this year, it’s a decision that every bank has to make in the first six months of this year,” Reuters quoted Cowles as telling the European Financial Forum in Dublin. The bank, which already has a presence in 21 of the 28 members of the EU, did not disclose how many of its staff would be affected by any move. However, Cowles said the main problem was with operations that specialise trading financial instruments for major clients. “Our issue is with our broker dealer, which is located in the UK and will lose, presumably, passporting rights,” he said. Passporting is the means by which banks such as Citi are able to conduct business out of London in other members of the EU without the need for extra regulatory approval. Last week Theresa May spelt out that the UK would not remain a member of the single market, which signalled to the City that banks will lose their passporting rights. “We’ve reached out, we’ve talked to regulators and people at government across many countries in Europe, including Ireland, Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the Netherlands, and we’re in the process of evaluating each one of them,” Cowles said. Citi already employs 2,500 in Dublin, and the Irish Times quoted him saying: “It’s been a great experience and when we take a look at different aspects of our business currently in Dublin, there will be some things that we’ll move [to Ireland].” As a result of its structure, Citi may face less disruption as a result of Brexit compared with other major employers. JP Morgan warned in the run to the referendum that 4,000 UK jobs are at risk, while HSBC has reiterated that it will have to shift 1,000 roles to Paris to retain access to certain business operations after the UK leaves the EU. Swiss bank UBS has also said roles will go – citing Frankfurt or Madrid as possible locations. Goldman Sachs is also expected to have to shift some of its 6,000-strong workforce out of the City. The bank’s chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said last week that New York would be the immediate beneficiary as Goldman was suspending current plans to move key operations from the US to London because of the Brexit uncertainty. A look at London’s rivals to be EU’s financial hub If London loses its place as Europe’s financial centre of choice, several cities will be waiting eagerly in the wings to pick up the mantle. But what are their advantages and drawbacks in the race to steal London’s crown? Dublin Pros Highly educated workforce with English as a first language. Existing financial centre with low tax rates and flexible labour laws. Cons Property prices are high and an influx of bankers would push them higher. Limited transport links to the rest of the world, although good connections to Europe. Frankfurt Pros High quality of life; with good schools, low cost of living and nearby countryside. Angela Merkel’s economic powerhouse already hosts key financial institutions, such as the European Central Bank. Cons Despite ample amenities, the city has a reputation for being quite boring. It’s not big, with a population smaller than that of Leeds. Other countries may oppose greater German dominance of Europe’s economic affairs. Paris Pros Good choice of international schools and the allure of being a genuine world city. International connectivity, via Charles de Gaulle airport. Cons France’s reputation for high taxes on the rich and inflexible labour laws. Cultural resistance to accepting English as the de facto global language of business. Amsterdam Pros Plenty of available office space in one of Europe’s best-connected cities. An emerging tech hub that has attracted the likes of Netflix, Tesla and Uber. Cons Dutch bonus cap limits bankers’ bonuses to 20% of their annual salary. Even Dutch bank ING admits the city has a shortage of experienced finance professionals. Madrid Pros The city is considering tax breaks for international firms looking to relocate. Good business links to emerging Latin American markets, unlike most European cities. Cons Known for being particularly noisy and overwhelmingly hot in the summer. English-language skills are still catching up with other parts of Europe.', 'David Davis is likely to introduce a “straightforward” Brexit bill on Thursday, two days after a significant ruling by the supreme court, sources have suggested. The secretary of state for exiting the EU said he would respond quickly to judges’ demands to give MPs and peers a vote in parliament but warned that the “point of no return” for Brexit had already been passed. “This does not change the fact that the UK will be leaving the European Union,” he said. The government is hoping to publish the bill on Thursday but there is a possibility it could slip beyond that.\\nDavis said the legislation would be narrow, focusing only on the question of triggering article 50, and warned that it must not be used as a “vehicle for attempts to thwart the will of the people, or frustrate or delay the process of our exit from the European Union”. “This will be the most straightforward bill possible, to give effect to the decision of the people and respect the supreme court’s judgment,” he added, stressing that it was not about whether the UK would leave the EU, because that had been decided by the June referendum. Davis said government lawyers were scrutinising the long judgment, but made clear that he remained confident article 50 would be triggered by the deadline at the end of March. “This timetable has already been supported by this house,” he said, saying the legislation would be separate to the “great repeal bill”. Davis was urged by Brexiters in parliament to issue the legislation quickly and keep it short, but was also pressured by opposition figures and MPs on his own side to publish the government’s Brexit plan as a white paper in order to allow further scrutiny. Ministers have claimed May’s Brexit speech at Lancaster House was an adequate plan. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “Labour accepts and respects the referendum result and will not frustrate the process. But we will be seeking to lay amendments to ensure proper scrutiny and accountability throughout the process. That starts with a white paper or plan. “A speech is not a white paper or plan, and we need something to hold the government to account throughout the process. You can’t have a speech as the only basis for accountability for two years or more.” Starmer was backed on the issue by Labour’s Hilary Benn, who chairs parliament’s Brexit committee, and a series of Conservative backbenchers including Ben Howlett who said: “I believe that the government should publish a white paper in order to enable my constituents to have their views heard.”\\nAnother Tory MP, Anna Soubry, said MPs should be able to discuss not just the triggering of article 50 but also the decisions to abandon the single market and free movement without debate or a vote. “What has my honourable friend got to lose with a debate on a white paper?” she asked. Davis – who had described May’s speech on Brexit last week as “the clearest exposition of a negotiating strategy I have seen in modern times” – said the prime minister’s address was sufficient explanation. “I’m afraid it’s very difficult to see how you can leave the European Union and still stay inside the single market, with all the commitments that go with that,” said Davis. Julian Lewis, the Conservative MP for New Forest East, questioned the motives of those pursuing a soft Brexit, saying they wanted to leave the EU but remain a member “in all but name”. The former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said the fact that it was a split judgment showed it was right for the government to take the case to the supreme court, but pushed for no further delays. “May I urge [Davis] – when he brings this in front of us – to keep it short, to keep it simple and most of all, to keep it swift,” he said. Aside from demands for a white paper, there were also calls for the final vote on the Brexit deal to be “meaningful”. The Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas asked that the bill be early enough in the process to allow time for a renegotiation if MPs and peers rejected it, rather than crashing out of the EU without a deal. The SNP’s Brexit spokesman, Stephen Gethins, asked why the government “feared parliamentary scrutiny”. He said the Tories had only one MP in Scotland, and asked Davis to “seek consent” from the Scottish parliament before legislating on areas over which it has responsibility. Davis argued that despite the court’s decision that the government need not obtain approval from the devolved administrations, he would consult key figures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Davis also made clear that the government supported the right of the judges to come to their conclusion, after the Daily Mail argued: “Yet again, the elite show their contempt for Brexit voters.” “We believe in and value the independence of our judiciary, the foundation upon which the rule of law was built,” he told colleagues. That followed a statement from the justice secretary, Liz Truss, who faced criticism for not defending the appeal court justices denounced by sections of the media as “enemies of the people” after they ruled against the government. Truss said: “Our independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law and is vital to our constitution and our freedoms. The reputation of our judiciary is unrivalled the world over, and our supreme court justices are people of integrity and impartiality.”\\nThe shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, argued that it was not enough, and that the prime minister should also speak out. “We have to be absolutely clear: the courts have done their job,” she said. “They have not made a political judgment, but just upheld a principle of parliamentary sovereignty which the Brexit supporters said their campaign was all about. “The three judges in the [high court] were vilified and put at personal risk and that is unacceptable. We need more than a statement from Liz Truss, which is too little too late. We need something from Mrs May.” The eagerly awaited ruling routes the protracted Brexit process through parliament, handing over to MPs and peers the authority to sanction the UK’s withdrawal. The decision sets clear limits on the extent of the government’s executive powers. Rights embedded in the law by the 1972 European Communities Act, which took the UK into what was then the European Community, cannot be removed by the government’s prerogative powers, a majority of the justices declared. The supreme court made clear that it was up to parliament to decide what form the legislation would take, and a very brief statute would “not undermine its momentous significance”.', 'The spectre of inflation is looming over the British pint, as two major brewers raised the price of beer and the brewing business warned of far larger Brexit-related rises to come. Heineken and Carlsberg have become the latest beer makers to raise prices, following MolsonCoors – maker of the UK’s most popular beer, Carling – and ABInBev, whose stable of brands includes Budweiser. Signs that beer is getting more expensive came as toy manufacturers warned prices could rise by 15% owing to the plunging pound, which is also beginning to put pressure on food prices.\\nThe beer industry has been wrestling with higher labour costs as a result of the national living wage introduced last year, while added costs are expected with a revaluation of business rates due in April this year. Heineken and Carlsberg said they had been left with no choice but to pass on increased costs to consumers. Carlsberg said it was responding to “significant cost challenges” by increasing prices by 2.6% on average, while Heineken said it was putting 6p on the cost of a pint. The chief executive of the British Beer and Pubs Association (BBPA) added that beer inflation could take off if the pound, which has fallen 18% against the dollar since the EU referendum, remains low. “Beer in the UK is made predominantly using domestic raw materials,” said BBPA head Brigid Simmonds. “However, the depreciation of sterling certainly means there will be some inflationary pressures through increased costs such as raw materials, packaging, energy and transport costs as well as employment and other cost pressures all businesses face. “It is also a concern that higher inflation will also lead to higher levels of indexation for taxes like beer duty, creating a vicious circle when it comes to cost pressures, which is why we are urging the chancellor to cut beer duty on a pint by one penny in the budget.” A source at one of the UK’s leading brewers said Brexit-related inflation was already being felt in the cost of transporting beer, because oil used for fuel is priced in dollars. But the source said the true effect was yet to be felt and could force brewers to impose much bigger hikes on beer. “If the weakness of the pound remains, we’ll be looking back to the days of 3% price increases fondly,” said the source. “It would need to be more like 10% or 15%.” A 15% increase would add 59p to the £3.92 average price of a pint in London, the UK’s most expensive place to drink.', 'Theresa May has caved to pressure to publish a formal policy paper setting out her plan for leaving the EU, prompting MPs to push for further measures to increase parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process. The prime minister revealed that the government would bring forward a white paper after a threatened rebellion by Conservative MPs joined opposition parties in calling for greater accountability from the government. “I recognise there is an appetite to see that plan set out in a white paper,” May said. “I can confirm to the house that our plan will be set out in a white paper published in this house.”\\nMay announced the U-turn at the beginning of prime minister’s questions in a move designed to wrongfoot Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader in turn called on her to clarify the timing of the publication, which MPs now want to see before they are asked to pass legislation to trigger article 50. The Brexit bill giving May the power to take the UK out of the EU is likely to be introduced to parliament on Thursday, after the supreme court ruled MPs and peers must approve the process. However, the government refused to say when it would bring forward the document, leading to calls from Labour for MPs and peers to have access to the information before parliament is asked to vote. Confirmation of plans to publish a white paper shows the power of rebel Tory backbenchers to influence legislation in concert with the opposition parties. Government ministers had previously insisted May’s plan was set out with sufficient clarity in her speech last week. But leading Conservatives including Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve, as well as MPs from Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems, called for a formal policy document that specified the government’s negotiating aims. “It was a bit of a surprise but I’m incredibly delighted,” said Ben Howlett, the Conservative MP for Bath who had been calling for a white paper. “We haven’t discussed what amendments might or might not be put in. We’d been focusing our attention on getting a white paper.” A number of Tory MPs who wanted to see a formal policy document are satisfied with the move, which will allow them to tell remain-voting constituents that they extracted a concession from the prime minister. However, Labour MPs, the SNP and Liberal Democrats are holding out hope that some Tory MPs will still join them in pushing for further climbdowns, including assurances that parliament will be given more of a say on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and full tariff-free access to the single market. Dozens of amendments will be submitted by MPs trying to attach conditions to the Brexit bill, with the SNP alone saying they will put forward 50 proposals for changes. The Labour frontbench will concentrate its efforts on getting greater parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit, including the swift publication of the white paper along with protections for workers and environmental standards. Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, has written in the Guardian to insist the party is ready to fight a “long and difficult battle” with the government throughout the process.\\nStarmer said Labour would table a series of amendments, including a call for the government to publish a formal document setting out its priorities and a meaningful vote on the final deal. Meanwhile, Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, said the government should go further than a white paper and publish impact assessments. “Our parliament should be as well informed on the progress of these negotiations as the European parliament will be. As we proceed, the government should publish all its impact assessments so that we too can judge whether they are negotiating the best deal possible.” Corbyn focused his questions in the House of Commons on making sure the Brexit bill contained safeguards for workers rights. The Labour leader also pressed May on her trip to see Donald Trump in the White House on Friday, urging her to guarantee she would not sacrifice parts of the NHS and public services to US companies as part of any post-Brexit trade deal. “The threat to workers’ rights is there every day – six million earning less than the living wage; many people, nearly a million, on zero-hours contracts with no protection being offered by this government,” he said. “What they’re doing is offering, once again, the bargain-basement alternative.”\\nCorbyn and his close allies are discussing how to manage the expected rebellion among Labour MPs – including some on the frontbench – against the party’s policy of not frustrating Brexit. Dozens of Labour MPs are planning to defy the party whip and either vote against or abstain. Corbyn hinted strongly last week that he would apply a three-line whip, which would usually mean dissenting frontbenchers would lose their jobs. But Labour sources are privately suggesting that while there will be a clear party line – consistent with Corbyn’s suggestion on the morning of 24 June that article 50 should be triggered immediately – they also understand the concerns of MPs who represent constituencies that voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. On Wednesday night some Labour MPs were frustrated by reports of a deal between the whips of both major parties to allow just a few days for debate, as the government pushes to get the legislation through as quickly as possible. Some frontbenchers, including Tulip Siddiq and Daniel Zeichner, have said publicly that they could not back legislation triggering article 50. The position of many Labour MPs hardened after the prime minister signalled last week that she plans to leave the single market and ditch key aspects of the customs union. The Guardian understands that Corbyn is considering convening an extra meeting of the shadow cabinet later this week to discuss the issue, which risks exacerbating the rift between MPs in post-industrial seats where there are profound concerns about immigration and those in constituencies that voted remain. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, sought to toughen Labour’s stance on Tuesday, making clear on BBC Newsnight that her party was ready to engage in “hand-to-hand combat,” as the legislation makes its way through the House of Commons, a process that could begin as soon as next week.', 'The government now has an extremely tight deadline to pass even a short bill through the Houses of Parliament, but it is still possible to meet its article 50 deadline of the end of March. One option to speed up the process through the House of Lords would be to offer extra scrutiny days in return for reducing the gaps that are usually left in between the different stages of a bill. There are also emergency options for the government to secure extra days to debate.\\nIn Theresa May’s favour is the fact that there is not a large appetite in either the Commons or the Lords to actively block the process. The SNP and Lib Dems will be likely to vote against the bill if their amendments are not passed, and some Labour rebels will join them. But overall Labour has no desire to appear to be trying to prevent the referendum result being honoured. Sources in the House of Lords say peers will try to “improve the legislation” through the process but not necessarily through parliamentary defeats. Key issues are likely to be around the type of Brexit, including economic access and the relevance of the parliamentary vote on the final deal – an issue on which May could be forced to move on. Peers also say they want to avoid so-called ping-pong, in which legislation is not passed so bounces back and forth between the two houses. As in the Commons, most peers do not want to be see to be trying to frustrate the will of the people.\\nThe judgment says the length and form of the legislation is entirely down to the government so we can expect the draft to be tightly written. Lawyers have warned against the political desire for a one-line bill. However, ministers could still be pushing for that in order to meet the timetable and reduce the possibility of amendments, which have to be shown to be relevant to the title of the bill.', 'Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain edges towards the EU exit door.

We do it because we believe our perspective matters – and it might well be your perspective, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you. The big picture As expected, the supreme court has now ruled that the government must obtain the consent of parliament before it can trigger article 50, beginning the formal two-year process of Britain’s departure from the EU. The ramifications of this decision – in particular, whether it will allow MPs to obstruct or alter Theresa May’s Brexit plans – will be much chewed over in the days to come, and we’ll look at them in next week’s briefing. But it’s fair to say quite a bit of the heat has been taken out of the article 50 debate by the prime minister’s announcement in her big Brexit speech last week that she would put the final Brexit deal before parliament.\\nApart from that – and the warning that Britain would walk way from the negotiating table if it did not get what it wanted from the EU, because “no deal is better than a bad deal” – the speech was mostly a confirmation of previous hints. So: bold, global Britain will leave the single market and the customs union – but keep the best of both through a new comprehensive free trade agreement, sector-by-sector deals and a bespoke customs pact allowing frictionless trade. At the same time, it will end the free movement of EU citizens, withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, and stop paying “vast amounts” into the EU budget. That, at least, is the intention. What the EU27 will actually allow, of course, is another question. European leaders, officials and media lined up to say Brexit would hurt Britain a lot more than the bloc, and that May was (to put it politely) asking rather a lot. Not waiting to see whether or not she’ll get it, on Monday the prime minister unveiled a major new industrial strategy for Britain, promising special deals for five key sectors plus a a new system of technical education and better infrastructure. And at the end of this week she will be in New York, meeting the newly inaugurated president, Donald Trump, to discuss (among other things) a promised quick UK-US trade deal. (Australia is also interested in talking trade). As the Centre for European Reform’s John Springford pointed out in an interesting Twitter thread, however, Britain’s trade with the US amounts to about a third of that with the EU (while Australia represents a great deal less).\\nThe view from Europe Not terribly impressed, it would be fair to say. The EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the upcoming Brexit talks would be “very, very, very difficult”, while the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the UK would pay a “huge price” for prioritising immigration curbs over single market membership. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit negotiator, said May was dreaming if she thought she could get everything she was asking for: It is an illusion to suggest the UK will be permitted to leave the EU but then be free to opt back into the best parts of the European project, for example by asking for zero tariffs from the single market without accepting the obligations that come with it ... I hope that British people will see from the perspective of an EU taxpayer, how unreasonable this would be. Pretty much everyone (including Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble) said the government should think twice about turning the UK into a low-tax rival off the European coast, which both May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, have said could happen if Britain does not get what it wants. Germany denied it had rebuffed an attempt by May to seal an early deal on citizens’ rights post-Brexit, saying the EU27 were unanimous in the view that the subject could only be discussed once Britain had triggered article 50. Meanwhile, back in Westminster With May’s hard Brexit plans confirmed, Labour MPs who had vowed to respect the referendum result agonised about backing an article 50 bill which would set that strategy in motion – especially one that might lead to the UK becoming a tax haven.\\nFrontbenchers including the shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, were among those in turmoil. Jeremy Corbyn suggested MPs would be whipped to vote in favour, but several in strong remain constituencies, including shadow ministers Tulip Siddiq and Catherine West in north London, said they would vote against anyway. The division will not help the party’s prospects in two key byelections in Labour seats, Copeland and Stoke on Trent, both of which recorded strong leave votes in the referendum. Ukip’s leader, Paul Nuttall, has confirmed he will stand in Stoke. On the opposite side of the fence, the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, accused Labour of “lamely giving up” while Britain “drives off a cliff” towards Brexit, saying future generations would not forgive the party for failing to stand up to May’s plans. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, hit back at Farron, accusing him of “fanning the flames of division” and of having “absolutely nothing to say to the 52%” who voted to leave the EU. You should also know Citing hard Brexit worries, Goldman Sachs stalled plans to move jobs to the UK, while HSBC advanced plans to move jobs form London to Paris. Nissan, which promised to turn its Sunderland car plant into one of the world’s biggest, said it would review that once the UK’s Brexit deal is settled. Gerry Adams warned that taking Northern Ireland out of the EU would destroy the Good Friday agreement. Nicola Sturgeon said a Scottish independence vote was more likely after May’s decision to pull Britain out of the single market. No 10 backed Boris Johnson after he compared François Hollande to a German guard in a second world war film “administering punishment beatings”. Read these: In the Guardian, Libération’s veteran Brussels correspondent, Jean Quatremer, delivered a bracing broadside against May’s Brexit wishlist and taught those who didn’t know it the French equivalent of “to have one’s cake and eat it”: When someone wants the impossible, in French we say they want ‘the butter, the money from the butter, and the dairymaid’s smile’. This is the Brexit Theresa May wants: ‘hard’ only for the other 27 states but ‘soft’ for Britain – because she wants to keep all the benefits of EU membership and concede nothing in return ... It’s not going to happen. In the New Statesman, Matt Qvortrup said the content of May’s speech showed she had given in to German chancellor Angela Merkel even before the Brexit negotiations had begun: The British prime minister blinked first when she presented her plan for Brexit. After months of repeating the tautological mantra that ‘Brexit means Brexit’, she finally specified her position ... By accepting that the ‘UK will be outside’ and that there can be ‘no halfway house’, Theresa May has essentially accepted Angela Merkel’s ultimatum even before the Brexit negotiations have formally started. In Vanity Fair, Henry Porter lamented the end of the British dream: Unlike the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the damage it has caused to the UK and Europe look almost irreversible ... Brexit London will lose its status as both a great financial hub and a centre of creativity in the arts and sciences, and that those with talent and highly valued skills will eventually leave a country that does not have the wit to acquiesce in its own survival.

Government ministers previously insisted May’s plan had been set out with sufficient clarity in her speech last week. However, leading Conservatives such as Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve as well as Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems have applied pressure for a formal policy document setting out the government’s negotiating aims.\\nMay announced the U-turn at the beginning of prime minister’s questions in reply to Tory MP Chris Philp. “I recognise that there is an appetite in this house to see that plan set out in a white paper,” she said. “I can confirm to the house that our plan will be set out in a white paper published in this house.” However, the government refused to say when it would publish the document, leading to calls from Labour for MPs to have access to the information before they are asked to vote on triggering article 50. The government is expected to publish a bill on Thursday after the supreme court said parliament must vote on whether to trigger article 50. Opposition parties and the Tory rebels are likely to push for the white paper to be published before parliament votes on the legislation. A Labour spokesman said: “We now want to see the timing and it is clear the white paper needs to come to parliament in time for the debate ... MPs have a right to be able to see what the government’s plan of action is. The speech is not adequate. It set out a wish-list of options. “As we’ve said many times, Labour respects the decision of the British people to leave the EU and therefore will not frustrate the will of the British people. But respecting the will of the British people is very different from respecting the will of the British government. We need to see the plan and make sure the process is held to account in parliament at every stage.”\\nMay’s staged announcement appeared designed to wrongfoot Jeremy Corbyn at the start of PMQs, but he moved on to press the prime minister on the need to preserve workers’ rights as part of the Brexit negotiations. The Labour leader also pressed May on her trip to see Donald Trump in the White House on Friday, urging her to guarantee she would not sacrifice parts of the NHS and public services to US companies as part of any post-Brexit trade deal. “The threat to workers’ rights is there every day – 6 million earning less than the living wage, many people, nearly a million, on zero-hours contracts with no protection being offered by this government,” he said. “What they’re doing is offering, once again, the bargain basement alternative.” He added: “Many have concerns that in your forthcoming meeting with President Trump you will be prepared to offer up for sacrifice the opportunity of American companies to come in and take over parts of our NHS or our public services. “Will you assure the house that in any trade deal none of those things will be offered up as a bargaining chip?” Corbyn went on to congratulate the tens of thousands of people who marched in Britain last weekend to highlight women’s rights and called on the prime minster to express concerns about Trump’s misogyny. May repeated her assurance that she was “not afraid to speak frankly” with Trump, without giving any guarantee that she would raise concerns about some of his past comments about women, such as the video of him talking about grabbing a woman “by the pussy”. Corbyn’s challenge on misogyny joined those from several MPs for May to raise concerns about other aspects of Trump’s policies. Andrew Tyrie, a senior Tory backbencher, urged her to seek safeguards against the use of torture by intelligence agencies, and Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, asked the prime minister to persuade Trump that climate change was not a hoax invented by the Chinese. Angus Robertson, the SNP leader in Westminster, also called for information on the UK government’s plans for a UK-US trade deal, urging the prime minister not to submit to pressure from American producers for lower food and safety standards. “Will the prime minister tell President Trump that she is not prepared to lower our food and safety standards or open health systems for privatisation, or does she believe this is the price worth paying for a UK/US trade deal?” he said.', 'Tony Blair’s failure to control the flow of workers from eastern Europe fuelled the anti-immigration sentiment that led to the UK’s Brexit vote, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the chancellor launched a strongly worded attack on the former prime minister’s open-door policy when eight former communist countries joined the EU in 2004. Britain was one of only three countries – alongside Sweden and Ireland – that decided to have no transitional arrangements to limit the flow of people from eastern Europe looking for work and Hammond said the results of that decision were still being felt.\\nThe chancellor said the Brexit vote was not the result of the anti-trade and anti-globalisation feeling that manifested itself in the US presidential race. “But what there was clearly was a strong strand of feeling against uncontrolled migration. And I lay the responsibility for that squarely at the door of prime minister Blair who failed to impose transitional regime in the UK in 2004. “So while other countries in Europe smoothly transitioned the A8 members [Accession 8] and the freedom of movement from A8 members Britain took the full force of the tide in 2004, and that created a public perception which we still haven’t shaken off to this day.” Hammond said the UK was not anti-migration and that only a minority thought the borders should be completely closed. “It is very important to the British people that we control our borders, but most of them do not want to use that control to shut the borders, they simply want to have the control,” he said. The chancellor said departure from the EU and from the single market did not mean there would be no migration. He said Britain would want to attract skilled workers but wanted the ability to control the flow of unskilled, cheap labour. “What we’ve said clearly is that we cannot accept the principle of free movement,” Hammond said, adding that any EU national could simply change their place of residence from Bulgaria or Romania to the UK. “We can’t accept that any more.” Oxford university professor Ngaire Woods said it would be a serious mistake if Britain included foreign students in its immigration curbs post-Brexit. “If we make them part of Britain’s immigration debate we’ve smashing our own kneecaps before even beginning the race. “Don’t kneecap your best asset. Let us thrive, make sure that immigration policies tell the world that Britain is open and welcoming to the best most entrepreneurial, energetic talent from all over, without restraint and constraint.” Hammond said the government had no intention of kneecapping itself and would still need migrants for an economy operating at close to full employment. The chancellor said the UK economy had confounded those predicting immediate dire consequences from the result of the referendum in June, largely due to the resilience of consumer spending. But he warned that growth was set to slow this year as the impact of the weaker pound raised inflation and eroded spending power. “A floating exchange rate is a smooth and efficient transmission mechanism that deals very effectively with an external shock,” the chancellor said. “But currency depreciation is now feeding into inflation which will increasingly affect consumer behaviour this year, hence the lower forecast for growth in 2017.” When the figures for the fourth quarter of last year are released later this month, it is expected that the economy will grow by around 2% in 2016. The expectation is that expansion will be about 1.5% in 2017.', 'Theresa May has announced that the government will publish a white paper on Brexit, and we want you to tell us what you think should be in it.\\nConservative MPs had threatened a rebellion by joining Labour in calling for a formal policy document on negotiating objectives. Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, May confirmed one would be produced. We’d like to hear your suggestions for what the government’s white paper should contain, and what amendments to the article 50 bill you think opposition parties should focus on. An example: Labour’ Chuka Umunna, chairman of Vote Leave Watch, said he would like to see “a commitment to put £350m a week into the NHS that Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling committed to during the referendum campaign.” You can share your thoughts by filling out the form below. We’ll put together an article featuring your suggestions.', 'The supreme court’s ruling on article 50 on Tuesday was perhaps inevitable, after a high court ruling that the government should not have spent time (82 days) and taxpayers’ money (a still unspecified amount) challenging. But it was a significant moment in the Brexit process, and showed that the prime minister should never have attempted to sideline parliament. Thus ends the uncertainty over the article 50 process. Now comes the substance. Last week the prime minister made a speech setting out her Brexit objectives. She confirmed that she intends to take Britain out of single market membership and parts of the customs union, and seek to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement in their place. This is a tall order, with high risks. And the higher the risk, the greater the scrutiny should be. If the prime minister fails, it will be families, working people and communities across the country who will pay the price.\\nThat is why, when the government introduces its article 50 legislation, Labour intends to table amendments to hold the prime minister to account throughout the Brexit process. First, the government should publish a document – ideally a white paper – formally setting out its negotiating objectives so that the progress and outcome of the article 50 negotiations can be tested against them. Second, the government should report back to parliament regularly during the negotiations so that progress can be known and checked. I accept, of course, that this must not undermine the negotiations, and any Labour amendment will reflect this. Third, MPs should be given a meaningful vote on the final agreement – that means a vote cannot take place with just days to go before the end of the process, and must be held before any vote in the EU parliament. These amendments – and others Labour is considering – would give meaning to the parliamentary process and ensure we have a robust system in place to ensure accountability throughout the negotiations. The government should welcome this and seize the opportunity to strengthen the oversight and scrutiny of the Brexit process. The best outcome will be one that is challenged and tested at every opportunity. Having fought in the courts to deny MPs a say on article 50, the government would be quite wrong to now introduce legislation that is near-impossible to amend or debate. That would be completely against the spirit of the ruling. These amendments also hint at a wider, but often ignored point: the triggering of article 50 is merely the start of the process for leaving the EU; it is not the end. Much more important is the nature and extent of any new agreement between the UK and the EU. That agreement will define our relationship with the EU, and we have choices about what that should look like. Labour’s guiding principles are that: • Jobs and the economy must come first. That is why we have insisted throughout on the importance of tariff- and impediment-free access to the single market – which is crucial for our manufacturing sector – and a deal that works for services as well as goods • All rights enjoyed because of our EU membership over the past 43 years should be preserved in full and without qualification. Those include all workplace rights, and environmental, consumer and human rights\\n• Any new agreement should promote the continuation of collaborative working between the UK and the EU in areas such as science, technology, medicine, crime prevention and counter-terrorism, among other things • There can be no question of implementing the prime minister’s threat to destroy our social model and turn the UK into a tax-haven economy if she fails in negotiations. That would completely undermine social protection and workplace rights. To help achieve these ends, Labour will insist that the prime minister cannot unilaterally change domestic law in the course of Brexit negotiations. Whether this is through the proposed “great repeal bill” or other legislation, every change to domestic law as a result of Brexit must be through primary legislation, voted on in parliament. That will give MPs on all sides of the house the chance to campaign and make the case for the kind of Brexit deal they believe Britain needs. That is upholding parliamentary sovereignty; triggering article 50 is just the start of the process. The battle ahead will be long and difficult.', 'Britain’s booming technology sector risks being forgotten in the rush to cushion traditional industries from the impact of Brexit, business leaders have said. A day after the government launched an unusually interventionist industrial policy designed to protect what it perceives as key areas of the economy, a group representing 900 tech companies said their lost access to European skills and markets could be far worse than was appreciated. Research commissioned by techUK reveals that British employers in digitally intensive industries are particularly reliant on overseas talent, with 45% of recent vacancies filled by foreign-born workers. In software and computer services, nearly a quarter of UK workers were born overseas, and the share from European Union countries has grown fastest due to more restrictive immigration rules for foreigners from elsewhere. The sector is also far more exposed to potential new trade barriers than the rest of the economy, with a relatively high dependence on EU service sector exports and common European regulatory standards on data sharing. The techUK report singles out the importance of negotiating a free trade agreement that can adequately replace this single market access, especially in a World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework that remains almost exclusively focused on industrial and agricultural goods. “There is no sector more dynamic, more innovative, more resilient than tech, but that doesn’t make it immune to Brexit,” said Jacqueline de Rojas, the trade group’s president and the UK managing director of the software firm Sage. “As this report makes clear, there are real risks that need to be understood and addressed.” Michael Keegan, chair of Fujitsu UK, said: “Companies will be looking for a robust legal basis for cross-border data flows, that the UK remains open to the very best global talent, and that British businesses are able to compete fairly across European markets.” The report says technology companies are behind 24% of UK exports and 3 million jobs. The government’s new industrial strategy focuses heavily on traditional manufacturing sectors such as a car-making and aerospace. The Japanese carmaker Nissan has already benefited from secret assurances from the government about the impact of Brexit, while British farmers have been promised a series of concessions by the agriculture secretary, Andrea Leadsom. On Monday the business secretary, Greg Clarke, insisted the “new active role” for government would not mimic “fatally flawed” protectionist approaches in the 1970s but would focus on new products such as electric cars. “Too often they became strategies of incumbency,” said Clarke of the old approach. Though the government is also a vocal champion of digital technology, the sector’s leading companies are concerned that it remains less visible than some and should not taken for granted during the Brexit process. “Our sector is more diverse and hard to define,” said Julian David, the chief executive of techUK. “It does not have one big obvious factory and it’s a bit less well understood. They aren’t doing it out of malice, but it’s complicated.” Relatively low WTO barriers for electronic products and the industry’s historically strong links to the US may also have encouraged false hopes that technology will easily weather Brexit. “There’s been some relief that the sector would not be too heavily hit by tariffs,” said David, who warned that non-tariff barriers in the service sector were far more of a concern. So far the EU has shown little appetite for extending current open access to countries outside the single market. “The EU would need to be willing to enter into negotiations on subjects that is has traditionally not engaged on in the context of trade discussions with countries outside the European Economic Area,” says the report. “For example, audio-visual and media services are specifically excluded from the EU’s free trade agreements.” Recent decisions by big US investors such as Facebook and Google to maintain European headquarters in London had buoyed hopes that the industry would remain resilient. But techUK, which counts both internet giants among its members, says it would be a mistake to assume such highly publicised moves indicate an industry that is relaxed about the changes that might follow Brexit. “Companies are taking are taking a bet that the UK will remain a good place to do business, but they are concerned,” said Antony Walker, deputy chief executive of the trade group. “They are taking the government at its word that it will maintain access to European markets and skilled workers.”', 'Trade unions, MPs and business leaders have questioned whether the government’s new industrial strategy will succeed if Britain leaves the single market in Europe, despite Theresa May pledging that it will create a platform for businesses to grow after Brexit. The industrial strategy, unveiled in Warrington, Cheshire, shows the prime minister is prepared to take a more interventionist approach in British industry than previous governments. The green paper states that five sectors will receive special government support because of their potential: life sciences, vehicles with low CO2 emissions such as electric cars, industrial digitalisation, the creative sector and the nuclear industry. Support could include help with trade deals, deregulation and the creation of new institutions to develop skills or research.\\nHowever, Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said the plan could be overshadowed by May’s pledge that the UK will leave the single market. “Above all, the greatest support the government could provide to UK jobs and business is to commit to access to the single market and the customs union,” he said. “Without this access, manufacturing is going to be seriously hobbled.” Business leaders welcomed the concept of an industrial strategy but accused the government of missing an opportunity to improve productivity in Britain, which lags behind other developed economies. Stephen Ibbotson, director of business at the ICAEW, which represents chartered accountants, said: “A golden opportunity has been missed to provide a solution to the UK’s productivity puzzle and this is just one example of the significant lack of detail in the industrial strategy overall.” The EEF, the manufacturing trade body, said the industrial strategy could provided a “huge tonic” if it tackles the “key weaknesses, areas of concern and opportunities” that are outlined in the consultation document. Terry Scuoler, the EEF chief executive, said: “It must live up to the promise of driving different behaviours and outcomes for the British economy, which requires the whole of government working together to support it with clear leadership from the prime minister and her cabinet. The fact that the PM has unveiled these plans herself suggests that this message too has successfully landed.” UK Steel said the industrial strategy was an “important first step in achieving a strong, sustainable and world-class steel sector”. Thousands of jobs remain under threat in the struggling steel industry. Sectors will be expected to organise themselves to lobby for government support or law changes. An “industrial strategy challenge fund” will help distribute millions of pounds for research and development in areas such as smart energy and robotics. A £556m boost for the “northern powerhouse” has also been announced including a £10m fund to develop the life sciences for Manchester and Cheshire firms and a new conference centre for Blackpool. In addition, the green paper includes a £170m investment in new “prestigious” institutes of technology. Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said the government believed the UK was falling behind nations such as China when it came to workers’ technical skills. “What we’re proposing here is that if we want to prosper in the future, if we want to achieve our potential, we think that a big priority has to be to improve our level of skills training,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. However, Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said the technical education strategy would “do little to plug the £1.15bn hole in the adult skills budget created by Tory cuts since 2010” and said the government had already watered down a series of flagship commitments, from putting workers on boards to tackling executive pay. “All the signs so far are that the government is not prepared to put its money where its mouth is,” he said. GMB, the UK’s third largest union, also cautiously welcomed the strategy, which it said “gives a clear indication the government have finally accepted big businesses can’t be left to shape the UK economy”. National secretary Jude Brimble said employee rights should be at the heart of any industrial renewal. “As we face an uncertain future and economy outside the EU, a new ‘active’ role for government cannot mean actively attacking rights and protections at work under the guise of deregulation and cutting red tape – we’ve been there before,” she said. The SNP and Liberal Democrats, who oppose the UK exiting the single market, were more sceptical. The Lib Dem business spokesman, Don Foster, said it was laughable that an ambitious industrial strategy could be achieved during a withdrawal from the single market. The effects on manufacturing of leaving the customs union are not mentioned in the document. “On top of Brexit, this Conservative government is cutting education spending, slashing support for green industry and failing to invest in infrastructure,” Lord Foster said. “The Tories used to claim to be the party of business – now they are only the party of hard Brexit.” Ministers have tasked Sir Mark Walport, the government’s chief scientific adviser, with deciding whether the UK should establish a research centre for energy storage, batteries and new power grid technology. Energy storage is seen as a key way for the National Grid to cope with the intermittent nature of a growing amount of renewable power, which now accounts for 25% of electricity generation. Batteries are also key to the electric vehicles which the government has enthusiastically backed with grants and tax breaks. “Given the UK’s underlying strengths in science and energy technology, we want to be a global leader in battery technology,” the industrial strategy said. Kate Blagojevic, Greenpeace’s head of energy, criticised nuclear as a source of energy, describing it as “more expensive and hazardous”. However, she said: “Renewable technology and low-carbon transport are the way forward. So it is great to see the government’s focus on electric vehicles and on skilling up our workforce.” However, Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party, said ministers had missed an opportunity. “At the heart of any forward-thinking industrial strategy should have been an unequivocal commitment to phasing out the use of fossil fuels,” she added. The government also promised to publish a long-term “roadmap” this year on keeping down energy costs to businesses. “Industrial gas costs are internationally competitive but electricity costs have moved out of line with other European countries,” the green paper said. The roadmap will look at energy efficiency and whether future support for offshore windfarms should be given under the current subsidy scheme, which is paid for by levies on all energy bills. Solar power, fracking for shale gas, and carbon capture and storage for fossil fuels did not feature in the industrial strategy.', 'If ever proof were needed that headline writers set the tone at the Daily Mail, the newspaper’s online report delivered soon after Tuesday’s ruling from the supreme court provides it. Above a fairly straightforward news story about the court’s decision to allow the country’s elected representatives a vote on the biggest constitutional upheaval in a generation, initially the headline read: “Yet again the elite show their contempt for Brexit voters!”\\nLaunched within an hour of the verdict, the headline went on: “Supreme Court rules Theresa May CANNOT trigger Britain’s departure from the EU without MPs’ approval … as Remain campaigners gloat.” The copy itself provided little evidence of gloating. The Mail’s first take response was tougher even than that of its rival pro-Brexit tabloids, which have made no secret of their antipathy to any attempt to delay Britain’s departure from the European Union. The first story in the Express accused judges of “thwarting the will of 17m Britons”, while the Sun originally went with an exhortation to “Just Get On with it!” before a headline that made it less clear who exactly should be getting on with anything: “Theresa May loses Supreme Court Brexit battle forcing MPs vote – but Prime Minister vows to get it out of the way before March – even if Corbyn plots ‘absurd’ appeal to EU.” Reports launched within minutes of the historic and complex vote are very much the first draft of history, but these stories nevertheless underline how the Mail has led the way with virulent, hard-hitting coverage during the EU referendum campaign and subsequent political upheaval. Reporters on the Mail know the score. Even if their copy is straight down the line, they expect barbs to be added in the headline and captions. A headline that accuses supreme court judges of being elitist and contemptuous counts as positively mild, of course, when compared with the most controversial of the Mail’s headlines during the whole imbroglio.\\nLast November a front page that called the supreme court judges Enemies of the People who had “declared war on democracy” prompted 1,600 complaints to the press regulator Ipso, and international revulsion. Not least because the phrase was more typically associated with murderous revolutionary leaders in both Soviet Russia and France, as well as dictatorships ever since. Ipso took no action over those complaints, pointing out that as the press code of conduct “gives newspapers the right to editorialise and campaign” it was neither inaccurate nor misleading to call judges “enemies of the people”. Yet comparisons were swiftly made between that headline and a Nazi newspaper from 1933 that used the same construct – head and shoulder shots and abusive headline. Full Fact, an independent website, pointed out that the Nazis included journalists and politicians and not just judges, however. Read some of the hundreds of comments below the Mail’s news story and it seems clear that some would not see that as such a leap. One of the most popular comments an hour after the decision read: “After we leave the EEC people should turn their attention to reforming the Establishment, staring with the House of Commons, The Lords and The Judicial system. They are not fit for purpose.” As ever with the Mail, it is through its print front pages that its editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, likes to set the agenda rather than the first online reports. Dacre did indeed come back from his annual January break to edit today’s paper. Immediately after the ruling, Downing Street said that it would “respect” the judgment. It remains to be seen whether the Mail will follow suit.', 'Now the prime minister has set out her agenda for Britain leaving the European Union, it provides an opportunity to turn our minds to what it will take to generate jobs, raise living standards and make Britain an even more prosperous and dynamic economy. In short, to make the UK the best place in which to do business. While there has been much hand-wringing and angst about the upcoming negotiations, they pale into insignificance beside the manifest economic benefits that will flow from Brexit – if the government does the right thing. To this end, the government should now plan to ensure the country can take full advantage as soon after Brexit day as possible.\\nWe should aim to remove tariffs, either unilaterally or through free trade negotiations, thus reducing the cost of food by up to 40%, and the cost of clothing and footwear by up to 20%. With a reduction in other input tariffs, this would be an enormous boost for those “just about managing”. It will free up consumer spending, helping inflation and the economy at large. We should compensate business for any tariffs erected through the tax regime, at a cost of less than half of our EU net contribution, and we should have signature-ready trade deals and a deregulation programme prepared for Brexit day. This is work that must start now. All the benefits of Brexit are entirely independent from the single market and the customs union, except in so far as membership of these prevents us from crystallising them. There is also a potential and massively important fringe benefit of Brexit, in that the government will now have to do the things that George Osborne failed to deliver and which have been resisted by the City-dominated Treasury for so long. We need to rebalance the economy, and from this imperative government no longer has a hiding place. Our new freedom and EU contribution monies mean the government, at last, has the mandate and the resources to support our small and medium-sized exporters, and not be transfixed by the often protectionist multinationals. We must invest in universities and research and development and actually build infrastructure, not just talk about it. Seek the lowest-cost sources of energy rather than burdening consumers with massive bills. Provide non-equity loan capital and finance for entrepreneurs, growing firms and the tech sector, even if it means the City turning a buck less. Immigration must be cut, but not at the expense of talent and jobs. Bone fide university students should be assessed for immigration at the point of graduation, not entry – after all, education is a service sector “export” as much as selling Burberry handbags, and creates a network around the world and a pool of talent for business. We want the brightest and the best in this country, alongside investment in the development and training of our young people to ensure they are as employable as possible. It is shameful that we have nearly 600,000 unemployed under-25s.\\nThere are important things that the exit negotiations need to resolve: visas, residency, open skies. But the really important things are not EU trade arrangements – they would be nice to have but are not essential. The real benefits of Brexit will be a considerable chunk of GDP – and that’s without including the trade deals we will do with the rest of the world. Additionally, the rebalancing of the economy and making Britain the best place in which to do business will produce a boom in economic growth, investment and trade. By contrast, the cost of not having the trade arrangements with the EU – having tariffs imposed – are minor. Less than half our net contribution. And all this is quite apart from the political and constitutional imperative for a clean break: freedom to make our own laws subject to our own courts and with control of our own borders – the very things that define a nation state and for the preservation of which our forebears paid a high price in blood and treasure. Certainly we should not spend too much time on fruitless negotiations, we should instead be devoting more energy to looking forward, preparing for our freedom and the opportunity to be a vibrant, free-trading, enterprise nation.', 'Nicola Sturgeon has challenged voters in Scotland to decide whether they are content to have the country’s fate decided by rightwing Tories in London or vote for independence. The first minister again raised the prospect of a snap referendum on independence after the UK supreme court unanimously rejected her argument that Holyrood had to be consulted about triggering article 50. In an angry attack on the UK government’s approach to Scotland’s pro-EU stance, Sturgeon said the ruling meant all Westminster assurances that Scotland was an equal partner in the union were worthless. “This raises fundamental issues above and beyond that of EU membership. Is Scotland content for our future to be dictated by an increasingly rightwing Westminster government with just one MP here, or is it better that we take our future into our own hands?” she said. “It is becoming ever clearer that this is a choice that Scotland must make.” Sturgeon added that her government would table its own legislative consent motion in Holyrood, regardless of the ruling.\\nThe supreme court’s 11 justices, including two Scottish judges, said the longstanding convention that the UK’s three devolved parliaments had a right to vote on any Westminster legislation that affected their powers did not apply to EU membership. The Welsh and Northern Irish governments had also called for their assemblies to be formally asked to approve triggering article 50. But the court ruled that the Sewel convention, named after the Labour peer who drafted that clause, applied to domestic not international affairs. Sturgeon had expected that decision and had already admitted that even if the Sewel convention had applied, it did not amount to a veto for Holyrood over Westminster’s constitutional right to press on with triggering article 50. The first minister said the supreme court ruling exposed how weak the convention was. Sturgeon said she would press the case for a compromise deal on Scottish access to the EU when she meets Theresa May for talks on Brexit at the joint ministerial committee for devolved and UK governments on Monday. “It is now crystal clear that the promises made to Scotland by the UK government about the Sewel convention, and the importance of embedding it in statute, were not worth the paper they were written on,” she said. “Although the court has concluded that the UK government is not legally obliged to consult the devolved administrations, there remains a clear political obligation to do so. Indeed, the court itself notes the importance of Sewel as a political convention.” The Holyrood vote will have no legal standing but politically is likely to expose growing divisions among MSPs over Scotland’s stance on the EU, with the Scottish Tories now insisting that the Scottish parliament embrace the opportunities presented to it by Brexit. There was initially cross-party consensus that Scotland should be allowed special access to the single market because its voters rejected leaving the EU 62% to 38%. Scottish Labour is also under pressure: it backed giving Scotland special status but that stance has been rejected by Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s UK leader. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said her party would “have no truck with yet more SNP stunts on Brexit”, and would oppose Sturgeon’s new article 50 motion. “The SNP tried to use this hearing to hold the rest of the UK to ransom. It has comprehensively failed to do so,” Davidson said. “All parties should now respect the ruling that the court has given.” Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said her party would continue to back Sturgeon’s case for a special Scottish deal, but implied that Labour would withdraw support for future constitutional battles. Dugdale did not comment on Sturgeon’s plan for a Holyrood vote on article 50, but said: “Unity cannot be achieved by a politics that sees one half of the country constantly facing off against the other. We are divided enough already.” Labour officials said Dugdale would not comment on the article 50 vote until they had seen the motion’s wording. Sturgeon hopes the clash will increase lukewarm popular support for a snap independence referendum. Recent opinion polls by YouGov and BMG show only 38% Scottish voters want a vote this year, excluding don’t knows, with only 45% backing independence. Including don’t knows, support for independence falls to 38%. That has forced Sturgeon to rule out a referendum during 2017, but there is growing speculation she may call one for 2018. She is under heavy pressure within the SNP, chiefly from her predecessor, Alex Salmond, to hold a vote soon to ensure Scotland’s EU membership can be transferred smoothly before the UK leaves the EU. Salmond, now the SNP’s foreign affairs spokesman in the Commons, greeted the supreme court’s decision by announcing the SNP would table 50 “serious and substantive” amendments to the article 50 bill. That would include a demand that May gets agreement from all three devolved governments before she triggers article 50. Salmond said she should also publish a full white paper on Brexit alongside the article 50 bill as demanded by the cross-party Commons select committee on exiting the EU. Yet in his statement, Salmond ignored the supreme court’s unanimous rejection of the Scottish government’s claim it had a constitutional right to be formally consulted. He said: “If Theresa May is intent on being true to her word that Scotland and the other devolved administrations are equal partners in this process, then now is the time to show it. Now is the time to sit with the joint ministerial committee and not just casually acknowledge, but constructively engage. Consultation must mean consultation.” At least 10 out of the 14 MPs from Northern Ireland who take their seats in the House of Commons are likely to support the triggering of article 50. The Ulster Unionist party confirmed on Tuesday that despite calling for a vote to remain in last June’s referendum its two MPs – Tom Elliott representing Fermanagh/South Tyrone and Danny Kinahan who holds the South Antrim seat – will both be voting for the UK to leave the EU when the vote is put to parliament. All of the Democratic Unionists’ eight MPs are guaranteed to vote to back article 50, given that the party supports Brexit. In a joint statement reacting to the supreme court ruling on Tuesday, the two Ulster Unionist MPs said: “On the 23rd of June the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and on that basis, our MPs will be voting to trigger article 50 when the vote comes to parliament. “We welcome that the supreme court has noted that the devolved administrations will not have a veto on the UK’s decision to withdraw from the EU.” Overall the majority of Northern Irish MPs will back article 50 despite the fact that 56% of the electorate in the region voted to remain. Sinn Féin has four Westminster seats but is wedded to the traditional republican policy of boycotting the House of Commons. The Social Democratic and Labour party has three seats and, given its strongly pro-EU stance, will vote against article 50. The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, highlighted the Sinn Féin boycott of Westminster while condemning the decision not to give the devolved assemblies a say in article 50. Eastwood said: “Everyone on this island has a responsibility to ensure that this does not happen. It would prove devastating both politically and economically. That includes the Sinn Féin MPs who do not take their seats at Westminster. If Sinn Féin are serious about new leadership they cannot shirk their responsibility to the people of Ireland and should therefore take their seats to vote against article 50.”', 'Since the vote to leave the EU in June, a raft of major companies including Apple, Unilever and Cath Kidston have revealed plans to increase prices in the wake of the pound losing its value. Following the referendum, the value of the pound has dropped by 18.5% against the US dollar, leaving companies to hike up prices to counteract cost pressures. It comes as UK inflation increased to its highest rate for two-and-a-half years in December, and the Bank of England warned that households should expect a sharp rise in inflation next year as the weak pound impacts the costs of imports and squeezes family finances. If you run a small business, we’d like to know how the currency exchange fluctuations are set to impact it and if you’re having to reassess your prices.

Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee, which produced a damning report about sexual harassment and violence in schools, has launched a campaign to press the government to take swift action. She has called an adjournment debate in the Commons on Monday to try to build momentum. The education secretary, Justine Greening, is thought to be in favour of making SRE compulsory, but Miller says, despite mounting pressure from charities and senior politicians, she fears the process will be delayed because of the government’s singular focus on Brexit. “It would not be acceptable if ministers were distracted by Brexit,” she told the Guardian. “Every child needs the opportunity to have a good teenage life. We need to act now to make sure they get the proper education they need.” Miller’s intervention comes as a new poll published on Monday suggests there is overwhelming public support for compulsory SRE in schools. A survey of 2,000 adults by the children’s charity Plan International UK found that eight in 10 are in favour of making it a mandatory part of the school curriculum in all types of schools, including faith schools, free schools and academies.\\nThe survey also asked participants about their own experiences of sex education at school and found that little more than a quarter (27%) found it informative – among over-55s the figure was just 11% – while 17% of those polled said they didn’t receive any sex education at school at all. Just 12% felt the education they received about relationships – including issues like sexual orientation and abusive relationships – was informative, while nearly a third (31%) said they had not received any education on relationships at school. “What I’m trying to do is build some momentum,” said Miller, the former culture secretary. “We’ve been hearing for quite a while that the government is going to do something, but things are not progressing fast enough. I feel there’s no difference in policy position between me and the government, but is it a priority?” A recent survey by Barnardo’s found that three-quarters of children between the ages of 11 and 15 felt they would be safer if they had age-appropriate SRE at school, with seven in 10 children saying they thought the government should make it compulsory. “I think there’s a growing narrative that says we can’t ignore what children are asking for. For me this is hugely important,” said Miller. “I’ve got three children [two teenagers and a 21-year-old]. You know when you are living through it how important this is.” According to Miller, it is the impact of the internet that has changed the landscape for young people, with the advent of cyberbullying, online abuse, access to internet porn, sexting and extortion using sexual images. “They are all new things that were not around the last time statutory guidance on SRE was published.” Last year, the women and equalities committee published a report that exposed what it described as the shocking scale of sexual harassment and sexual violence, which it said was not being tackled effectively in schools. It found that almost one-third (29%) of 16- to 18-year-old girls had experienced unwanted sexual touching at school and nearly three-quarters (71%) of all 16- to 18-year-old boys and girls had heard terms like “slut” or “slag” used towards girls at schools on a regular basis. Meanwhile, 59% of girls and young women aged 13 to 21 said in 2014 that they had faced some form of sexual harassment at school or college in the past year. When Greening took over at the Department for Education last year, she made it clear that she would look into the issue of sex and relationships education. Campaigners want to see it included as an amendment to the children and social work bill making its way through parliament. Apart from the pressures of Brexit, civil servants are also thought to be grappling with the complex logistics of having to renegotiate contracts with every single academy in order to make SRE compulsory. Academies and free schools have greater freedoms than local authority-run schools and do not have to follow the national curriculum. Publishing the latest survey, conducted by Opinium, Tanya Barron, Plan International UK chief executive, said: “It’s time for mandatory sex and relationships education in UK schools. Girls are telling us that they are suffering harassment at school, they don’t feel safe online, and are scared on the street. “They are telling us unequivocally that mandatory and good quality sex and relationships education is one of the most important ways to help change this situation. It’s encouraging that the wider UK public agrees in such large numbers. “Quality, comprehensive SRE covers much more than just the physical side of sex and reproduction. It’s a common-sense policy that all children should receive information about what a healthy relationship looks like, what sexual consent means, and issues such as the impact of sexting and pornography.”', 'Downing Street was forced to come to the defence of the foreign secretary Boris Johnson after he warned the French president, François Hollande, not to respond to Brexit by trying to “administer punishment beatings” in the manner of “some world war two movie”. The foreign secretary evoked the darkest period of France’s recent history as he rejected comments by an adviser to Hollande who said Britain should not expect a better trading relationship outside Europe than it currently enjoys inside.\\nAt a foreign policy conference in Delhi, Johnson said: “If Hollande wants to administer punishment beatings to anybody who seeks to escape [the EU], in the manner of some world war two movie, I don’t think that is the way forward. It’s not in the interests of our friends and partners.” His words came only 24 hours after Theresa May reminded her cabinet ministers in her Lancaster House speech to show restraint by warning “any stray word” could make securing a Brexit deal more difficult. Although the French government declined to respond to Johnson’s remarks, Guy Verhofstadt, the lead Brexit negotiator for the European parliament, branded them “abhorrent and deeply unhelpful”. British politicians accused Johnson of being unfit to head the diplomatic service. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “This is an utterly crass and clueless remark from the man who is supposed to be our chief diplomat.\\n“I assume Boris Johnson says these things to deflect from the utter shambles this Brexit government is in over its plans to take Britain out of the single market. But this kind of distasteful comment only serves to unite Europe further against Britain at a time we need friends more than ever.” Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said: “We’re well aware the foreign secretary has a habit of making wild and inappropriate comments, and talking about world war two in that context is another one of those. “That’s not going to be something that’s going to improve the climate for these negotiations. I don’t think threats or wild comparisons or analogies are going to help the situation.” But Downing Street defended the foreign secretary, saying he had not likened Hollande to a Nazi, and was only “making a theatrical comparison to some of those evocative WWII movies”. The spokeswoman rejected press interpretations of the comments, comparing them to the “hyped-up media reports” condemned by the prime minister in her Brexit speech. Jo Johnson, the universities and science minister, said his brother had been “using colourful language to get over an important point”. Michael Gove, Johnson’s fellow leave campaigner, said people offended by Johnson were “humourless [and] deliberately obtuse”.\\nThe foreign secretary’s remarks in Delhi came after Jacques Audibert, diplomatic adviser to Hollande, said that Britain could not expect to get a better deal outside the EU than it enjoyed inside. Some ministers believe France is leading the calls to punish the UK, and possibly the City of London, over its plans to leave the European Union. Last October Hollande, in common with many other European politicians in recent months, declared Britain had to pay a price for Brexit: “There must be a threat, there must be a risk, there must be a price,” he declared. Johnson’s remarks are likely to add to growing diplomatic friction between France and the UK following a public feud over the wisdom of France calling a Middle East peace conference just before Donald Trump takes power in the US. The UK refused to send a delegation to the conference and did not sign the final communique. It is not the first time the former London mayor has evoked the second world war in the context of Brexit. He told the Sunday Telegraph during the referendum campaign that the EU was an attempt “by different methods” to unite the continent under a single government. He said: “Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically.” Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, the Brexit secretary David Davis cited the “difficult histories” of other EU nation states as evidence for why they would not want to leave the EU. Davis also quoted the former cabinet secretary Robin Butler who, he said, had told him: “The civil service coped with world war two; they can cope with this.” “There is no other country which is in our position,” he said. “We are an offshore island. We have got a great global history and so on. For us, going into the EU in the first case it was the common market, we saw it as an economic issue. But for most of the countries of Europe it is not just about economics. It is about democracy. It’s about the rule of law – countries that have come from difficult histories into what for them is the exemplar of modern politics – freedom, rule of law, democracy.” Speaking on Wednesday, Johnson said new tariff barriers between Britain and Europe would “cut both ways”, citing imports of German luxury cars into Britain. It was “absolutely incredible”, he said, “that in the 21st century member states of the EU should be seriously contemplating the reintroduction of tariffs or whatever to administer punishment to the UK”.\\nHe said: “[Britain] can put a 10% tariff on 820,000 cars, Mercs. That’s a lot of money for the exchequer. We think we can do a great free-trade deal for the benefit of both sides. The more trade, the more jobs on both sides.” He added that it would be “foolish for the EU to seek to cut off its nose to spite its face by punishing the City of London [because] those jobs won’t migrate to Paris or Frankfurt but to Singapore or Hong Kong or New York”. As a result, he said, they were not going to be tempted to leave the EU. Johnson told the audience in the Indian capital it was “time to stick up for free trade”, arguing that Britain and India had enormous potential to boost their economic ties, and suggesting the Indian government start by relaxing its 150% tariff on imported whisky. Scotch whisky accounts for about 4% of the Indian market, the largest market for the liquor in the world. “Now imagine we could just double that or treble that by removing those pesky tariffs, giving the Indian consumer more money to spend on other things,” he said. “And, symmetrically, we could have zero tariffs on wonderful Indian products like those electric cars or buses or perhaps even bicycles that we’re now seeing on the streets of London.” Such a deal could not be negotiated until Britain formally left the EU, he said, but could at least be “sketch[ed] out in pencil on the back of an envelope”. “We may be leaving the EU, we may be taking back control of our borders, but that does not mean we want to haul up the drawbridge. We do not want to deter Indian talent from our country,” he said.', 'Hurrah, the UK will embark on its post-Brexit adventure with an industrial strategy, or at least a government that is prepared to use the term without embarrassment. What’s more, the business secretary, Greg Clark, hit some of the right notes in his introduction to the green paper. The goal is not to pick winners, which would be to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s. Nor is it to protect the position of incumbents. It’s about “creating the right conditions for new and growing enterprises to thrive”. Few could disagree with the sentiment, or the eagerness to see the benefits of self-improvement spread more evenly across the nation. Jolly good, but defining the ambition and describing past errors is the easy bit. It would be hard to conclude that the government’s thinking amounts to a clear-headed plan that is ready to be put into action. Many tough decisions were ducked in the green paper, or left hanging in the air. Should the steel industry celebrate a “strategic approach” to procurement? Talk of mimicking Crossrail’s consideration of “social and economic factors” could suggest that British steel will be preferred in mega-projects like HS2. But the document didn’t say so explicitly. Many of the passages on procurements were about stirring innovation and encouraging small businesses. Steel may not be as exciting as life sciences and clean cars, but is it inside or outside the strategic tent? The UK Steel lobbying group was right to reflect that “much still needs to be done” to agree one of the vaunted “sector deals” with government.\\nOr look at digital infrastructure, where the UK is ahead of major competitors on fast broadband but woefully behind the likes of Spain, South Korea and even Turkey on ultrafast capacity, the digital-to-the-premises (DTTP) variety. Does Clark agree with Vodafone that BT’s performance in delivering DTTP is “a national embarrassment”? Or does he think regulator Ofcom’s attempt to stir investment by opening up access to BT’s ducts and poles will suffice? Those questions lie at the heart of one critical debate about the UK’s digital future, but it’s not addressed. Instead, as in many areas, the green paper merely repeated commitments that have been made already – in this case the £740m going to support the roll-out of fibre broadband and 5G mobile technology. One suspects a serious government-backed commitment to DTTP would be counted in the billions or involve breaking up BT. In other words, the subject is too tricky for this document. Some industrialists will find to much to cheer, notably the emphasis on reducing energy costs (though it remains a mystery how that squares with the grotesquely expensive Hinkley Point C nuclear power station). Overall, though, one is left with a sense that the green paper amounts to a long list of good intentions without a clear sense of which should be preferred in a world of finite financial resources. Are we going down the American route (led by procurement and universities) or the German (with its emphasis on research and development) or the French (build some grands projets)? There were elements of all three. That may be a good thing, or it may be a muddle. The white paper needs to be sharper. Sainsbury’s should take the heat over boss’s barn\\nIf you were a shareholder in a FTSE 100 company, would you expect to be told that your chairman had been censured by the board after an internal investigation? Would you want to know there had been “material breaches” of policies covering conflicts of interest? The answer to both questions is surely yes. The chairman is supposed to be a guardian of good behaviour. If he or she has messed up – intentionally or not – it’s important to say. The tale of David Tyler, the Sainsbury’s chairman, and his barn conversion was told in Monday’s paper. In short: Tyler used one of Sainsbury’s green energy and engineering experts to inspect his plans to install underfloor heating at his home in East Sussex. One of the supermarket group’s building contractors then developed an action plan for free; and two other Sainsbury’s suppliers were contacted for specialist advice. Tyler then contacted Sainsbury’s company secretary to arrange compensation for use of employees’ time. He ended up paying £5,000 to charity and did not benefit financially. But the resulting investigation, conducted by two non-executive directors, concluded that “he received (paid for) services from an expert supplier due to his position that he would otherwise not have been able to”. Thus the official warning. It’s not the biggest scandal in the world, and Tyler’s failure to follow the rules was accepted as unintentional. But the intriguing detail is that it all happened in 2013. Sainsbury’s didn’t think it worth mentioning to shareholders, even in the years when its annual report scrupulously addressed the motor-racing sponsorship deals that some suppliers gave to the son of Justin King, chief executive at the time. That looks like double standards. Better late than never, Sainsbury’s could correct its oversight in this year’s annual report, lest anyone should think the publication, like Tyler’s country pad, is full of hot air.', 'Britain’s consumers rushed to buy dollars and euros for their holidays as the value of sterling dropped after Theresa May’s commitment to a hard Brexit last week. Money-changing companies reported a surge in people buying foreign currency as details of the prime minister’s speech on Brexit emerged, and the value of sterling fell steeply against the dollar. The pound recovered later in the week, making up for the dip, but caused jitters among consumers. Post Office Travel Money, which accounts for a quarter of UK consumer foreign-exchange transactions, said it dealt with almost two-thirds more transactions in the first three days of the week compared to the same time last year. FairFX, which specialises in prepaid currency cards, said transactions surged last Sunday, when parts of the prime minister’s speech emerged. Analysts say they expect further fluctuations in the value of the pound in coming months as further details of Brexit emerge and markets react. British tourists going to Europe get 11% fewer euros for their pounds now compared with last year, and 13% fewer to the dollar, said FairFX, which advises consumers to buy now and lock in on current prices to avoid possible future dips. “The value of the pound fluctuated significantly in 2016 with political events around the world such as the Brexit vote and the US election being contributing factors. As uncertainty continues to surround Brexit, 2017 could see continued volatility,” said chief executive Ian Strafford-Taylor. However, consumers are advised not to overreact to daily currency fluctuations. Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said changing £500 for a short break, for example, would only result in marginal differences with current currency movements. When going for holidays longer than a weekend where larger amounts of money are needed however, the fluctuations will noticeably affect consumers, he said. Exchanging money in airports, where rates are frequently at their least competitive, should be avoided, said Kevin Mountford of price comparison site MoneySuperMarket. “If it is from a tourist perspective, you have got to go with the flow but the last thing you do is wait until you get to the airport,” he said.', 'What will be the Brexit bill? Britain’s exit from the European Union will be like many divorces: there will be a bitter argument about money. According to the Financial Times, Britain will have to pay €20bn (£18bn) to leave the EU, taking into account the UK’s share of the EU’s unpaid bills and pension liabilities. The German magazine Wirtschaftswoche suggested in August that the Brexit bill could be as high as €25bn.\\nSome officials in Brussels think both these estimates are on the low side, although they do not offer alternative figures. The budget is one of the main areas Michel Barnier, the European commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, is focusing on, in addition to trade and the single market. But his team have yet to produce their own estimate of how much Britain should pay. How long will it take to find out? Negotiations on the budget will not begin until Theresa May invokes article 50, the EU exit clause. The prime minister has promised to notify the EU of Britain’s intention to leave by the end of March 2017. Her announcement will start the clock on two years of negotiations. As money is so fundamental, it is likely the final bill will not be settled until the end. What are the issues? The article 50 talks will be about unwinding EU membership: the EU will press Britain to pay its share of unpaid bills and liabilities; the UK is expected to seek a share of EU assets. The EU’s unpaid bills totalled €218bn in 2015. These are IOUs that have paid for motorways, bridges and other economic development projects in poorer regions of Europe. Unpaid bills have mounted up over the last 15 years, as the EU has gone on a spending spree, following the enlargement to central and eastern Europe. Another problem will be agreeing the UK’s share of the EU’s €59bn pension liability, which guarantees income for 1,730 retired British officials. EU sources say the UK will be on the hook for its share of all pension liabilities, not only those of British officials.\\nWill the UK be paying into the EU budget after leaving? In theory the UK could be required to pay into the EU budget until 2022 or 2023, because of the time lag between authorising payments and paying the bill. But sorting out the divorce is only part of the Brexit negotiations. Britain will have to pay into the EU budget if it wants good access to the single market. Reimer Böge, a German Christian Democrat MEP who used to chair the European parliament’s budgets committee, said countries wishing to participate in the single market would need to pay into the common pot. Without such payments, British students and British universities would be barred from EU programmes and funding. “Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and other net payers can never accept that they pay the bill for the internal market and Great Britain has access to the market without paying anything,” he told the Guardian. “There will be an ongoing bill, year by year, to be a member of the internal market.” He thought it was “a bit premature” to be talking about numbers, because “the story is very complicated”. Although the final bill is not known, one thing is clear: EU leaders will want to show there is a price for leaving the EU, while the UK will try its hardest to minimise it. With such large sums at stake, there is plenty of negotiating to do.', 'Brexit means Brexit In a major speech, Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, said that when the UK leaves the EU it will also quit the bloc’s single market, customs union and court system, and made clear that Britain was not going to seek any form of EU membership via the back door. She also committed to putting the final Brexit deal to a vote in both houses of parliament, handing politicians in Westminster the power to block the plans. Follow our rolling coverage for analysis and reactions. Key points from May’s Brexit speech: what have we learned? Prime minister vows to put final Brexit deal before parliament Congress members to skip inauguration With Donald Trump’s inauguration just days away, more than 30 members of Congress plan to boycott the ceremony on Friday. Their pledges to skip Trump’s swearing in come amid escalating outrage over alleged connections between the president-elect’s team and Russia and disparaging remarks about the civil rights veteran and congressman John Lewis, who said last week he does not regard Trump as a legitimate president. Amid the chaos, Trump met with Martin Luther King III, the son of the revered civil rights leader, on Monday, the public holiday that commemorates his life. King and William Wachtel, a New York lawyer, said they spoke to Trump about voter participation and how to carry forward King’s father’s legacy by making it “easier for everyone to vote”. Asked about Lewis, King said: “Things get said on both sides in the heat of emotion. And at some point in this nation we’ve got to move forward.” He added that he would “continue to evaluate” Trump’s commitment to representing all Americans. Inauguration boycott grows as Donald Trump meets Martin Luther King III What defunding Planned Parenthood would look like Congress seeks to defund Planned Parenthood through a budget measure that blocks the reproductive health services provider from accepting Medicaid, which allows it to offer contraception, cancer screenings and STI tests to 1.5 million patients at some 650 health centers for no cost. Public health officials who work in states where Planned Parenthood’s presence is already in decline – such as Texas or Wisconsin – are sounding the alarm. They say the loss of Planned Parenthood would imperil the health of thousands of women who already face high barriers for care. “I don’t know where else I would go,” one woman who used Planned Parenthood for cancer screenings and contraception said. “I would have to spend time finding somewhere else to go, and worry about: can I afford it? And worry about: am I getting the same quality of care I get with Planned Parenthood? It’s only making it more difficult for people already having struggles.” Healthcare without Planned Parenthood: Wisconsin and Texas point to dark future First day of World Economic Forum The annual World Economic Forum commenced today, with political leaders, top business people, economists, academics and the media meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Trump’s influence can be felt, even if he’s not there, making the event feel like “Hamlet without the prince”, Larry Elliott writes. Just as significantly, Xi Jinping is the first Chinese premier to attend Davos. He spoke to a packed room and defended globalization. Absent Trump dominates Davos discussions as WEF starts Istanbul gunman arrested The man accused of killing 39 people in an Istanbul nightclub on New Year’s Eve was arrested on Monday night at a friend’s home after a two-week manhunt. Istanbul’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said Abdulgadir Masharipov was born in Uzbekistan, received training in Afghanistan and entered Turkey illegally last year. Sahin said it was clear the gunman carried out the attack on behalf of Islamic State. Masharipov has admitted his guilt and his fingerprints matched those at the scene, Sahin added, describing the attacker as a well-educated terrorist, born in 1983, who speaks four languages.

Parts of US heating faster than globe as a whole A new study published by scientists from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst looking specifically at the north-eastern US found that this area will warm much more rapidly than the globe as a whole and faster than any other US region. The authors expect the north-east will warm 50% faster than the planet as a whole and find that the US will reach warming of 2C (3.6F) 10 to 20 years before the globe as a whole. Parts of United States are heating faster than globe as a whole Obama welcomes Cubs to the White House In his last official White House function, Barack Obama on Monday hosted the Chicago Cubs, who won the World Series last year for the first time in 108 years. Speaking in the East Room, Obama noted that it was important to spend time on sports “when there’s other stuff going on”, saying that could bring a divided country together. “Sports has changed attitudes and culture in ways that seem subtle but ultimately made us think differently about ourselves and who we were. It is a game and a celebration but there is a direct line between Jackie Robinson and me standing here,” he said. It was apt that Obama’s final event celebrated a team from his adopted home town – even though the president is actually a White Sox fan. Michelle Obama, who was in attendance, supports the Cubs. ‘Sports has changed attitudes’: Obama welcomes Chicago Cubs to White House And finally ... Trump tweets wrong Ivanka The president-elect quoted a praiseworthy tweet which mentioned Ivanka Majic, a council worker from Brighton, England, instead of his daughter. “And you’re a man with great responsibilities. May I suggest more care on Twitter and more time learning about #climatechange,” Majic wrote back on Tuesday morning. Donald Trump mistakes Ivanka from Brighton for his daughter', 'Apple is raising prices on its UK App Store by almost 25% to reflect the sharp depreciation of the pound following June’s vote to leave the European Union. The new prices enshrine parity between the dollar and the pound, at least for apps on the iOS and Mac app stores. An app that costs $0.99 in the US, and used to cost £0.79, will now cost £0.99. Apple announced the price rises in an email to app developers on Tuesday, and told them “when foreign exchange rates or taxation changes, we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store”. It says the new prices will roll out over the next seven days, giving customers a short opportunity to beat the price increase. Similar price increases are expected to hit other Apple stores, including the iTunes Store for music and video and the iBooks Store. Britain isn’t the only country experiencing price changes. India is seeing price increases due to changes in service taxes, while Turkish prices are also rising due to depreciation of the Turkish Lira. Since the vote to leave the European Union, the value of the pound has fallen by 18.5% against the US dollar. Apple has already acted to change other British prices since the vote to leave the European Union: in October, it marked the launch of new Macs with a 20% price rise across the line. One computer, the Mac Pro, saw its price jump by £500 overnight. In a statement, Apple said: “Price tiers on the App Store are set internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, business practices, taxes and the cost of doing business. These factors vary from region to region and over time.” The price rises were announced the same day UK inflation surged to 1.6%, higher than expected. The Office of National Statistics said the increase was driven by rises in air fares and the price of food, along with prices for motor fuels.', 'Nick Clegg has revealed he urged David Cameron to change the remain campaign strategy in the final weeks before the EU referendum, saying the economic-focused Stronger In campaign was “bloodless” and failing against the emotional pull of the leave campaign. In an interview with the Guardian’s Owen Jones, the former deputy prime minister said he believed voters in Sheffield, where he has his constituency, had wanted to send a message not just to Brussels but to southern England and London for leaving the north of the country behind. “For a lot of people it was a vote against London, ‘them down there’,” the former Liberal Democrat leader said. “I got in touch with David Cameron by email and I said, ‘I think the emotional case for remain is being lost’. And my suggestion for the last week of the campaign was to do proper battle with the very emotionally pungent Brexit slogan, ‘Take Back Control’. “I said why not, ‘Vote remain to keep us safe’, so safe from recession, keep our kids safe etc? I just thought it was more emotionally powerful. He politely replied he wanted to stick to the economic strategy.” Clegg said he did not blame Cameron for the loss of the Brexit vote, but said the campaign was “very bloodless and allowed a more emotionally impactful argument in favour of dollops of money for the NHS, and economic utopia, the traffic would flow, the sun would shine, it allowed the other side to make these ludicrous claims … in a relatively unchallenged way”. The MP, who worked at the European commission before entering frontline politics, has drawn up a proposal for an interim deal for the UK after it formally exits the EU, which would involve re-entering the European Free Trade Area (Efta), which the UK spearheaded almost 60 years ago. Now comprising only four members – Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland – it would mean the UK remained inside the single market but outside the customs union and other schemes such as the common agricultural or common fisheries policies. The prime minister, Theresa May, is due to confirm the UK will be leaving the single market, with 12 key priorities for negotiations including control over immigration and removing Britain from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. Clegg said he believed it was a dereliction for the prime minister to pursue a hard Brexit strategy. “If you are the prime minister of such a deeply divided country, you have a duty to find a compromise, it means maybe some changes to how immigration works, trying to preserve our place in the single market,” he said. “It doesn’t mean unilaterally getting rid of everything and delegitimising the aims and hopes and dreams of 48% of the voting public. Since when does a prime minister basically say that the needs and aspirations and interests of 16.1 million fellow citizens counts for nothing?”', 'Theresa May’s speech last week setting out Britain’s broad objectives in forthcoming Brexit negotiations with the EU has been hailed, here and on the continent, as affording a long-awaited degree of clarity. This reaction is puzzling. May’s position remains clouded by delusional beliefs, wishful thinking, ignorance and outright lies, the latter being the speciality of her irresponsible foreign, secretary Boris Johnson, who reportedly helped shape the text. May’s speech had all the clarity of a muddy puddle. Yet it is on this slippery, shifting ground that the future prosperity of a liberated “global Britain” will supposedly be founded. None of the many grave and complex questions, of both principle and practice, raised by last June’s referendum result is appreciably closer to being answered in the toxic afterglow of May’s address. This was not a rerun of VE Day, to use one of the Second World War allusions so beloved of Johnson, David Davis, the Brexit minister, and their xenophobic media puppet-masters. This was a modern-day Dunkirk. Conservative leaders, running scared of rightwing ideologues, Europhobes, Little Englanders and closet Ukip-ers within their ranks, have plunged the UK head first into an avoidable strategic, economic and human morass from which the country will emerge poorer, more fractured and less influential. Now they try desperately to convince the world that defeat is victory. Most people are neither as stupid or gullible as the Tory hard Brexiters and their press allies would like to think. Those who agree with them may soon have good cause to reconsider as inflation rises, the pound falls further, wages stagnate and living standards slide. The Daily Mail gave a salute to the “new Iron Lady”, relishing May’s ill-advised Thatcher-like threat to walk away without a deal. The Sun said she was “magnificent”. The Daily Telegraph claimed it was “a defining moment”. What nauseating twaddle. Pass the sick bag, Alice, as the late John Junor, former Sunday Express editor, was wont to say. Do the Tory hard Brexiters have any idea how small-minded, petty, insular and ugly their triumphalist tribalism makes Britain look to its friends and neighbours across the EU? And can May really fail to see that the stubborn, falsely confident tone she adopted last week – needy, wheedling, passive-aggressive and subcutaneously hostile – is the most certain way to ensure a united front of 27 EU countries against Britain? This wilful blindness is a national embarrassment. May’s tone was the least of last week’s discomforts. On key matters of policy, she was vague to the point of recklessness. The revelation that she would not seek to keep Britain in the single market could hardly be classed as news. What is news is that May still believes she can have it both ways, despite repeated EU warnings against attempted “cherry-picking”. Britain would seek “the greatest possible access to [the single market] through a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free-trade agreement,” she said. This new agreement could even include “elements of current single market arrangements in certain areas”. Dream on, Mrs May. Doing or saying the same damaging or self-harming thing again and again and expecting a different result is said to be the definition of madness. Has the prime minister indeed lost the plot? If Britain is to avoid the “cliff edge” in 2019, when the article 50 negotiating clock stops, it is certainly true it will need special deals to come into immediate effect in key areas such as financial services, agriculture and fisheries. Business leaders know this; just look at the clutch of warnings last week from HSBC and Toyota, among others, about jobs and investment shifting elsewhere. The EU commission knows this. The French, with their eyes on the City of London, know this. So, too, do the other member states. But, as they say, the single market is indivisible. They will use this admitted British need to gain leverage – or block a deal altogether. As we have stated several times, the voters’ decision to leave the EU, though deeply regrettable, must be respected. But the many negative consequences can be mitigated by wise, balanced and courageous democratic leadership. This is what Britain now signally lacks. Where is the roar of protest at these wanton acts of national vandalism? The performance of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is as ineffectual as it is disgraceful. Only the Liberal Democrats among the main parties are exhibiting anything approaching passion and common sense. The opposition must get its act together. Despite the collective failure so far to confront May and the Tory hard Brexiters’ destructive jingoism, it is imperative that parliament has the last word, meaning veto power, over any final Brexit deal. This week, the supreme court is expected to uphold parliament’s right to vote on beginning the Brexit process. Britain’s sovereign, democratic House of Commons acting on behalf of the people who elected it, not an abusive, highly partisan and unelected executive, must also have the last, binding word.', 'Young voters aged 18 to 34 believe that reducing immigration is the least important issue Theresa May should focus on as she prepares to take the UK out of the EU, a new poll has found. The survey by Opinium found that people in this age group put reducing numbers coming into the UK last out of 22 priorities, with the availability of jobs, protection of human rights and well-funded public services their main concerns. The poll commissioned by Brexit Watch, run by thinktank Common Vision, highlights a sharp generational divide in views on the direction in which the UK is heading. It found that 57% of young people are not confident Brexit is being negotiated to suit their interests, against 28% who are confident. It shows that most young people do not back the main premise behind May’s Brexit strategy – that concern about immigration is so great that it should drive government policy. In her Brexit speech last week May made clear that public concern over immigration had left the government with no option but to leave the EU single market, because retaining membership would mean that the UK had to continue to accept EU free movement. When asked to rate Brexit priorities on a scale of 0 to 10, reducing immigration from the EU scored just 5.85 among 18 to 34-year-olds, below the need to share arts and culture between EU countries (6.34, in 21st place) and reducing poverty (6.21, 19th place.) Ensuring jobs are available scored highest among young voters (8.02) with protection of human rights second (7.95). Reducing immigration scored far higher among the over-55 age group (7.63) though even among these voters it was still not seen as so important as 12 other issues. Among over-55s, public services and free trade with non-EU countries were judged as most important. Overall, 57% of 18 to 34-year-olds said they were not confident that Brexit was being negotiated in a way that suits their interests against just 28% who said they were confident. By contrast, those aged over 55 were fairly evenly split, with 41% saying they were confident and 43% saying they were not. Common Vision aims to promote the interests of young people and ensure they are reflected in Brexit negotiations. Caroline Macfarland, director of Common Vision, said: “While the prime minister’s speech appealed to some of the interests of younger people, such as workers’ rights and parliamentary democracy, the emphasis on national sovereignty and immigration – key interests for older but not younger voters – risks repeating the failure of the referendum debate to engage with the next generation. “Young people are far more concerned about freedom of movement than reducing immigration, which our poll today found to be the least important issue for 18-34-year-olds from a list of 22 issues. “In this context, it’s not surprising that 57% of 18-34-year-olds don’t have confidence that Brexit will be negotiated in a way that best suits their interests. Theresa May needs to make an explicit commitment to sourcing, reviewing and accounting for the views of young people in the Brexit process otherwise the implications on trust and political engagement will be dire, and waste the profound opportunity we have to use Brexit to design a new political and economic settlement which recapitalises young people.” Around 70% of young people aged 18 to 24 who voted in the June 23 referendum supported remaining in the EU. Turnout among this age group was lower than among older voters but still high at over 60% and higher than expected by pollsters before polling day.', 'The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecasts for the UK economy this year after the latest signs that businesses and consumers have shrugged off the Brexit vote. Unveiling its new forecasts on the eve of a key speech by Theresa May on the Brexit process, the Washington-based fund also cut the outlook for 2018, reflecting widespread uncertainty over Britain’s future outside the EU. The IMF forecast that the UK will grow by 1.5% this year, up from a previous estimate of 1.1%. However, 2018 expectations were revised down from 1.7% to 1.4%.\\nThe fund noted that Britain’s terms of exit from the EU were “unsettled”. It listed that uncertainty among a host of risks it sees to the global outlook that also included the potential for a wave of protectionism as Donald Trump takes over the US presidency. The IMF was forced to accept in October that its prediction of a post-Brexit-vote financial crash had proved to be overly pessimistic. Monday’s upgrade brought it more in line with other forecasters after signs the UK economy grew at a solid pace in the second half of 2016. The IMF’s economic counsellor, Maurice Obstfeld, included the unknown nature of Britain’s future relationship with the EU in a list of factors contributing to a climate of uncertainty that also included elections in the eurozone, the change of president in the US and geopolitical tensions. The IMF used an update to its economic forecasts to highlight popular antipathy towards international trade and a widening in the gap between rich and poor. It called on governments to tackle inequality by helping people find work in fast-changing jobs markets shaken up by technology and globalisation. The IMF made no changes to its October forecast for global economic growth to edge up this year after a sluggish 2016. But it upgraded its outlook for the US on the assumption that more spending under Trump would boost growth. However, it said there was uncertainty around the nature of economic policy under the new administration and how it would impact other economies. Obstfeld noted signs of widespread frustration around the world at what many feel is an unfair distribution of the fruits of globalisation and economic growth. As policymakers and business leaders gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum, and with inequality top of this year’s agenda, the IMF became the latest in a line of international bodies to call for more shared prosperity. “Social dislocation due to globalisation and, even more, to technology change is a major challenge that will only intensify in the future. One result has been wider inequality and wage stagnation in many countries,” Obstfeld said, presenting the latest IMF forecasts.\\nHe added that a key takeaway from 2016 was that “sustainable growth must also be inclusive growth”. But at the same time, with nationalist politicians gaining ground in some countries, the IMF warned against moving towards more inward-looking policies. Without naming Trump, who campaigned on an anti-globalisation platform and with the promise of a big infrastructure drive, the IMF said there was a risk that higher spending could force the US central bank to raise interest rates at a faster pace to contain inflation and that would push up the US dollar. Those currency moves, which would make US exports more expensive and its imports cheaper, risked driving up “protectionist measures and retaliatory responses”, Obstfeld said. On the other hand, the extra spending in the US was likely to bolster economic growth, and if done in a way that did not stoke inflation it would allow the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a more moderate pace. The IMF sees the US economy growing by 2.3% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018. That was an upgrade from October’s forecasts for 2.2% for 2017 and 2.1% for 2018. For the global economy, the IMF saw more scope for growth to disappoint rather than beat expectations. It forecast 3.4% growth this year and 3.6% in 2017. That follows estimated growth of 3.1% in 2016. “A faster pace of expansion would be especially welcome this year: global growth in 2016 was the weakest since 2008-09, owing to a challenging first half marked initially by turmoil in world financial markets,” said Obstfeld, referring to sharp swings on markets this time last year. To help shore up growth in 2017, the IMF called on central banks to keep policy “accommodative, relying on unconventional strategies as needed”. It also repeated a call for governments to do their share of the heavy lifting with spending and long-term reforms to make growth more sustainable.', 'Monday I spent Saturday night talking about Brexit to a packed – since you didn’t ask – audience at the Ropetackle arts centre in Shoreham. Apart from being a very enjoyable occasion, it confirmed what many others have been saying: that old party allegiances are breaking down. Where people used to politically identify as Conservative or Labour – or in some cases Liberal Democrat or Ukip – they now primarily identify themselves as leave or remain. If this turns out to be more than a passing trend, it will make for an interesting general election in 2020. Most commentators have focused their attention on the Labour heartlands in the north that voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU and would be vulnerable to a strong Brexit Conservative or Ukip candidate.\\nBut there are also some Tories in the south who may have cause to be worried, not least Tim Loughton, the MP for East Worthing and Shoreham. Though Loughton had an easy win in 2015 with a 15,000 majority, things could get a lot tighter next time as his constituency voted 53%-47% to leave. When I mentioned Loughton’s role as cheerleader-in-chief for Andrea Leadsom to be next party leader, his name got boos worthy of a pantomime villain. Tuesday In 1988 Margaret Thatcher chose Lancaster House as the venue to praise the EU single market; it was no coincidence that Theresa May used the same setting to bury it. We hacks were cooped up somewhere in the basement for the best part of 90 minutes before the prime minister gave her speech. Not, it turned out, for reasons of security but to try to keep us from asking any awkward questions of the 27 EU ambassadors who sat stoney-faced throughout the 45 minutes May had their undivided attention. More interesting was Labour’s response. While Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, congratulated the prime minister on not taking the hard Brexit option, Jeremy Corbyn was berating her for turning the UK into a bargain basement tax haven. No wonder the rest of the Labour party weren’t quite sure what they were supposed to say or ask. “We weren’t given any briefing papers,” one MP told me. “When I asked why, I was informed that Labour hadn’t been given enough time to respond.” As most of May’s speech had been pre-briefed to the media several days previously, Labour politicians must have been the only people kept out of the loop. Wednesday When I was 10 years old back in 1966, my parents had a German boy to stay for the weekend as part of a school trip to our town. Before he arrived, my mum took me to one side and said: “When you’re playing war games with him, make sure you say ‘Let’s kill the enemy’ and not ‘Let’s kill Jerry’.” As much of my world view was informed by reading The Victor, War Picture Library comics, and watching films such as The Great Escape, this was probably good advice. At any rate, I managed to get through the weekend without causing a major diplomatic incident.\\nWhich is more than can be said for Boris Johnson, who used his visit to India as a backdrop for comparing François Hollande to a Nazi prison camp guard. While his remarks have been excused as lighthearted banter by the likes of Michael “With Friends Like These” Gove, it might be more helpful for the country if we didn’t have a foreign secretary whose understanding of 20th-century history wasn’t still equal to that of a 10-year-old boy in the 1960s. Thursday Much as I instinctively believed Uri Geller must be a charlatan when he turned up in Britain during the 1970s, part of me still wanted him to be genuine. And now it turns out that he just might have been. Recently released files have revealed that the CIA repeatedly tested Geller at the Stanford Research Institute between 1972 and 1976 and the Israeli spoon-bender kept passing with flying colours. Time and again, when locked in a sealed room and asked to draw the same image as a scientist was drawing elsewhere in the building, he came up with an uncannily similar picture. According to Geller, the CIA was so convinced of his paranormal powers it roped him in to telepathically order a top Russian official to sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty. But one thing still bothers me. If Geller is so brilliant, why did he waste so much time bending spoons and stopping watches? If I was that gifted, I’d have much more fun. Friday “The senator [later President Windrip] was vulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his ‘ideas’ almost idiotic, while his celebrated piety was that of a travelling salesman for church furniture, and his yet more celebrated humour the sly cynicism of a country store. Aside from his dramatic glory, Buzz Windrip was a Professional Common Man. Oh, he was common enough. He had every prejudice and aspiration of every American Common Man. He believed in the desirability and therefore the sanctity of thick buckwheat cakes with adulterated maple syrup, and the superiority of anyone who possessed a million dollars. He regarded spats, walking sticks, caviar, titles, tea-drinking, poetry not daily syndicated in newspapers and all foreigners, possibly excepting the British, as degenerate.” Not a modern commentary on Donald Trump, but an extract from the 1935 novel It Can’t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis which has just been republished by Penguin. When fiction becomes non-fiction. Digested week digested: The Gold House', 'If anyone expected 24 June to mark the end of a bitter and acrimonious battle over Britain’s place in Europe, they could not have been more wrong. The battle over Brexit is going strong and with recent briefings – some from cabinet members themselves – a somewhat poisonous atmosphere has emerged in parliament. Much of the focus is on last week’s cabinet committee meeting about leaving the EU, when Theresa May and her chosen ministers (a balance of leave and remain supporters) discussed three papers on what happens next. The liveliest issue was unquestionably how far the prime minister would use the “mandate” of the Brexit vote to control Britain’s borders, with Amber Rudd laying out the idea of a visa-entry scheme for highly skilled migrants as part of a free movement report. Pitched against the home secretary was the chancellor, Philip Hammond, whose decision to urge caution landed him on the sharp end of criticism from some Brexiters who say he is trying to stall the process. Had this script been written months ago, we would not have been able to predict the individuals taking on the key roles. The idea that tub-thumping, pro-remain Rudd, whose strength of enthusiasm for staying in the EU made her a Tory rarity during the referendum campaign, would be spearheading the fight for immigration controls would have been bemusing. Equally unlikely would have been the sight of Hammond – considered a staunch Eurosceptic by his own party just two years ago – banging the drum for a soft Brexit in which economic considerations trump a free-movement clampdown. Brexiters think the chancellor went soft during his time in the pro-European Foreign Office, with leave campaigners dubbing him “EuroPhil” during the referendum. But according to civil servants involved in the process, the arguments are more defined by the departments that the individuals are defending rather than their personal views. To put it crudely, Hammond, as chancellor, will be judged on Britain’s economic performance, while Rudd will have her feet held to the fire over migration numbers. And the battle is raging because so much is still up for grabs. People have been quick to label as a hard Brexit move May’s promise that the UK will have immigration controls and not be under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. But the truth is that, beyond the fact of an EU exit, things are not black and white, but a mass of grey in which economic and free-movement factors could alter dramatically ahead of and during negotiations. The Guardian understands that Rudd’s work permit idea is not the only option on the table regarding migration controls. Other ideas being mooted in Europe by experts such as the Tory MEP Vicky Ford, who heads an influential Brussels committee on the single market, include an upper break on numbers, or a registration system for EU nationals. Ford believes the EU 27 would still be open to close economic ties under such a system, and suggests that Britain could also consider checking migrants’ criminal records before they arrive without ruffling too many feathers. The Guardian has also been told that the issue of whether Britain should remain a member of the customs union – inside which EU countries negotiate trade deals collectively and set uniform external tariffs – is still up in the air. Although Liam Fox has suggested the UK will have to leave the customs union (perhaps to ensure his job as trade secretary remains viable), ministers did discuss a paper on the pros and cons of the issue last week, with some warning that the administrative costs of leaving could be huge. Even David Davis’s new adviser, Raoul Ruparel, who believes an EU exit will mean leaving the free trade bloc, has admitted it could inflict a permanent cost of £25bn on the UK’s GDP. The arguments are dripping out of departments and into the media. Some senior figures have suggested Davis needs to choose his words more carefully, and be acutely aware of the impact that every twist and turn has on the financial markets. Others have said Hammond is guilty of talking down the economy. Friends of the chancellor have hit back, however, suggesting it is in his DNA to proceed with caution. After all, what’s wrong with the chancellor acting like an accountant? Whatever the rights and wrongs of the Brexit debate, one thing is clear: May’s promise of “no running commentary” will be impossible to fulfil.', 'All human life is in Homerton hospital’s car park. Or at least, passing through Homerton hospital car park on the way to A&E or outpatients or maternity. A Bangladeshi woman in a wheelchair. A Hasidic Jewish schoolboy with ringlets and a limp. A bearded hipster with a newborn baby in a plastic carrycot. Inside there are nurses from the Philippines, from Spain, from Italy, from Gambia, from the Caribbean. There are doctors from India, and radiographers from Germany, and anaesthetists from Pakistan, and cleaners from Ghana, and midwives from Nigeria. To cut to the chase: there is everyone from everywhere. And of course they’re not alone in this. With more than half of all doctors coming from abroad – as they have since at least the late 60s – Homerton hospital in the East End of London is like every NHS hospital in every city in Britain. On the morning of Friday, 24 June, this was a fact that struck Junaid Masood, a Pakistani-born, British consultant urologist when he came to work at Homerton – and it struck him in particular as he looked around the theatre where he was about to operate. “It was the morning after Brexit,” he says. “Everyone was shocked and depressed and I just had this moment of clarity because I looked around and thought, ‘Oh my God, every single person in this operating room today is from the European Union. So, at the end of surgery, I got everyone to hold up a placard saying where they were from and put it up on Facebook. And then it just went nuts.”\\nThe picture of his team, smiling in their blue surgical scrubs, featured an Irish radiographer, a German consultant anaesthetist, a Greek urology registrar, three Spanish nurses and himself. It immediately went viral. The Facebook post was shared 19,000 times, tweeted hundreds of thousands of times, spawned copycat photos from NHS hospitals up and down Britain and ended up on the pages of newspapers across the world. Their smiles, however, look almost innocent now. Last week, the rhetoric of anti-immigration became wrapped up in the survival of the NHS, an institution that has been built upon the hard work of immigrants for almost its entire history. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, announced to the Conservative party conference that the NHS needed to become “self-sufficient in doctors” by 2025. It needed to end its reliance on foreign doctors, and it would do this by training an extra 1,500 medical students a year. This was news to everyone, not least those working in the NHS, or heading up our medical schools or the British Medical Association, because apart from anything else, the numbers simply don’t stack up. “It’s completely unrealistic,” Deborah Gill, the head of UCL medical school, tells me. “It’s a drop in the ocean. An extra 1,500 students is going to make no difference whatsoever.”\\nBut that doesn’t make it any easier to hear. Leonidas Karamountzos, the Greek registrar in Masood’s photo, looks uncomfortable when I ask him about it. “It can make you feel… look, I’m not going to say unwanted. Everyone is so polite. But if you keep hearing, ‘we don’t want any more immigrants, we don’t want foreign doctors’, it does make you feel unwanted in a way. I’ve been here six years, and of course I’m gaining from the NHS, I’m gaining experience, I’m getting paid, but it doesn’t feel fair that after six years you have people saying, ‘You know what? We don’t need you any more. We think we can do without you now, OK?’ “Because I don’t think you can do without us. That’s the thing. But then you get up and you go to work and you try to help British people get better.” Masood and Karamountzos are telling me this in the tiny gap between their morning clinics and their afternoon surgeries. “It’s absolutely chaos this morning, I have to be honest,” says Masood when he greets me. “The clinic is massively overbooked. But this is what always happens. And you spend 10 minutes more with one patient and there’s a massive knock-on effect and this happens every week, unfortunately, and I’ve got to rush upstairs because I’ve got four patients that need surgery this afternoon.”\\nThis is a familiar story to everyone who’s ever used the NHS. But what’s new is the toxic language of immigration coming up against the day-to-day reality of the NHS. This does feel new and ugly and unwelcome – and, for the 101,000 doctors born overseas who work in Britain, and the 140,000 nurses, and the 64 million of us who depend upon them, it’s a depressing new departure. Until now, the NHS has been a place apart from what happens politically. It is an institution, something so fundamental to our sense of Britishness that it has somehow managed to resist the xenophobic tide that has become such a feature of British public life. It is something that survey after survey tells us we hold precious; that touches every person in the country, in the most personal, intimate way. And the whole fabric of its continued existence relies on immigration. Roberta Bivins, a professor at Warwick University who is undertaking a major project to map the cultural history of the NHS, tells me that although the NHS has been leveraged as capital and ammunition by politicians since its very inception, there is something new at work. “We expect the NHS to be above all that. It really does feel like a loss of innocence to have something that is a symbol of British tolerance and cosmopolitanism and egalitarianism dragged through the mud in this way. It is truly shocking.” The NHS is one of the unique things that unites us as a nation, she says. “It’s a fundamental part of British identity. It’s been something that has represented how much we believe in equality. What I’ve found is that the NHS is constantly framed as the space that proves that Britain is a tolerant nation. Where racial and class and ethnic barriers are overturned. Where you can go and expect Britain to be at its best. Your doctor may have come from anywhere, and you will be treated the same as anyone else.” And that is still true. “I don’t see people and think, ‘You’re British. You’re Afro-Caribbean. You’re whatever,’” Karamountzos tells me. “For me, a patient is a patient. It doesn’t make any difference to me. Patients are patients and doctors are doctors. This is what counts.”\\nAnd for at least 40 years it’s been where the differences between us have been erased. “The NHS would never have survived the pent-up demand from the interwar years had it not been able to import staff from Africa and the former colonies,” says Bivins. “That has always been the price of universal access, and it has been enormously benefiting to British society. “Even by 1968, 46% of all doctors below consultant came from abroad, and 30% of all nurses.” What’s more, for much of the UK, she says, it was the first place where middle Britain came across multiculturalism. Part of Bivins’s project is a “people’s history of the NHS”, and as such she’s been gathering stories, “talking to lots and lots of people, and for many, especially older people, they’ll say it was the first time they met a black man or so on. It was where middle Britain met migrant Britain, and in a totally non-negotiable way. It’s the one place where you’d be mixing with people who are not like you, whether in terms of class or ethnicity – and who you’ll be dependent on during some of the most intimate and important moments in your life.” It was the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic games, she says, Danny Boyle’s great visual poem to the NHS, that made them start thinking about the central role the NHS plays in Britain’s cultural life. “And what is astonishing is how much the attitudes and rhetoric have shifted since then. It’s been quite amazing – and depressing – how that has happened in just four years.”\\nBoyle’s co-writer for the ceremony was Frank Cottrell Boyce, who tells me that the section on the NHS was “Danny’s passion”. He wanted the ceremony to be emotional. “The NHS is where British people are born and where they die… It’s a huge unifying force in British social life and the point of entry for thousands of migrants.” Boyle “really put himself on the line for it – threatening to leave when they suggested cutting it”. By “they” he means the government, and it turns out there’s a thread here. The culture secretary at the time? Jeremy Hunt. The BMA – which represents 170,000 doctors – knew nothing of the proposals before Hunt’s party conference speech was made. They were not consulted. The head of the Royal College of Physicians, Jane Dacre, points out to me that 40% of new consultant posts are already not being filled. At UCL, Deborah Gill says that while they welcome lifting the cap on the number of medical students they’re allowed to admit, they’ve no idea how it will be funded, if there will be enough foundation placements, or why it has anything to do with foreign doctors “coming over here, as they do, curing our patients and paying their taxes”. Nicola Strickland, head of the Royal College of Radiologists, tells me she believes the situation to be desperate and that Hunt’s proposals cannot possibly solve it – in fact, that they are likely to make things worse. To put it into perspective, she points out that only a tiny number of the extra 1,500 students will choose to go on and qualify as radiologists, and they won’t come through the system until 2030, or 2032 for clinical oncologists who the college also represent. “And by that time,” she says, “we’ll be lucky if we have a health service for them to work in.” Every specialism perhaps believes that its own is most crucial. But Strickland makes a convincing case for how the crisis in radiology recruitment will break the entire system. “It underlies almost every single diagnosis these days, and demand is going up exponentially. It’s increased by 29% in the past three years. But there is simply not the staff. We have hard solid data that shows that we need 260 extra trainees a year for the next five years even to catch up with the rest of Europe. We know this for an absolute fact. We are currently tied third bottom with Turkey. Imaging underlies every part of the health system and without it the entire health system will fall apart. I am desperate to get this message out there, and nobody is listening to us.”\\nA third of radiologists already come from abroad and they are trying to recruit more, but already one in 10 consultant positions is vacant, unable to be filled. “If you believe passionately, as we all do, in free healthcare at the point of need and you see that being destroyed… well, it’s very depressing and demoralising,” says Strickland. “Already 230,000 people are having to wait a month to get the results of their scans and that’s just not right. It causes stress and anxiety, and delays life-saving treatment. We are trying to tell everyone we can. We could train people but the money is not being made available and it’s going to break the health service. I really mean that.” It’s hard as an outsider to understand quite how big a crisis the NHS is in – if it really is as bad as Strickland says, or if it has always gone through these sorts of episodic cycles. But Anthea Mowat from the BMA tells me that it is real and that the collapse in morale is like nothing they’ve ever seen. “We’ve just done a survey, doctors 10 years post-graduation, and 42% of them say it’s much worse than they expected, and approximately the same number plan to go to work overseas because they don’t feel valued in the NHS. “We’ve got to the point that our own UK-trained doctors don’t feel valued. And now we don’t value our overseas doctors either.” In fact, Masood tells me that his department, for the first time, has a vacancy for a registrar and no applicants. “This has never happened to us before. We haven’t had a single applicant.” And a university hospital in London is a more attractive proposition than many posts, such as a GP in Stoke-on-Trent, for example, where 65% of GPs are already from outside the EU. Chandra Kanneganti, head of the British Indian Doctors’ Association, who runs three practices in the city, tells me there are currently 34 vacancies. Most of them have been empty for a year. But then, he says, because of visa changes it’s almost impossible for Indian doctors like himself (he’s originally from Hyderabad) to come and work in Britain. “Instead they go to the US, to Australia and Canada. In the 1960s, general practice in Britain was on its knees and it was my colleagues who came in droves to work in the inner cities and places no one else wanted to go. They saved the NHS, and the government needs to recognise this and not make this kind of politically motivated attack on us.” I try to end the interview with Kanneganti, but he won’t let me go. “I am so proud of the NHS, and I love this country. I love it for the way it recognises talent and hard work. And we do work hard and we pay taxes and we do not take benefits and all we are saying is, please recognise this.” It’s madness that someone as accomplished and hard working as Kanneganti feels the need to justify his position. Or Nancy Ifill, a sister in the emergency department of Whipps Cross hospital in East London. I catch up with her at 11pm, just after she’s arrived home in Colchester, Essex, having left the house at 6.30 that morning. She’s originally from Barbados, came here in 1989 and is now a British citizen. So does that mean she doesn’t feel the insecurity that many non-UK NHS staff feel? That they might not be able to stay. “I would never say I feel totally secure. You just don’t know. With Brexit, it feels like if they want you to go back, they could. I don’t know if this is being fuelled by Nigel Farage and his ideologies. It’s a similar thing with Trump and Hispanics, but it makes you feel like you really don’t belong. Like you’re a lodger. And when we’ve had enough of you we’ll put you out.” Does it upset you? “Of course it does. At the end of the day you come here, you contribute to the system. You’re not mooching off the state. And it’s a significant contribution. A society cannot function without a healthcare system. If you don’t have a healthcare system, you don’t have a society. And for people to think that you don’t matter… well, it’s a bit tragic.” Her colleagues at Whipps Cross are from everywhere. In her team, “I can probably count the number of ‘home-grown’ nurses on one hand. ‘Home grown’! It’s such an insulting, derogatory term. “Who is this organisation made up of? It’s foreign people. Whether they are nurses, cleaners, doctors, the great majority of people working in the largest organisation in the world are foreign people. If you remove them, you won’t have a system. This institution is at the heart of British life and it’s made up of foreigners.” It is, and it’s where the ideology of Brexit strikes against the idea of ourselves as a people in the most intimate way possible. Because the NHS is where we are literally at our most naked and vulnerable. It’s at the heart of what we believe it is to be British. We are – as every staff room in every hospital in every British city shows – a country that depends upon the hard work and contribution of people who have come from elsewhere.

These have now been corrected.', 'A post-Brexit hard border on the island of Ireland would make police officers sitting ducks for dissident republican attacks, rank and file members of the Northern Ireland force have said. New customs posts and other installations along the 325-mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would become “propaganda gifts” and physical targets for the New IRA and other groups opposed to the peace process, the staff association representing more than 90% of police officers in Northern Ireland has said. The Police Federation for Northern Ireland also expressed fears that a reinforced border would seriously undermine improving relations between frontier communities and serving police officers. In an interview with the Guardian, Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the federation, which represents around 6,600 officers, pointed out that the dissident republican terror threat was still ranked as severe. This meant an attempt to murder or maim police officers could happen at any time, he said. Lindsay said the threat would be even higher if officers were deployed at customs posts or crossing points to monitor the flow trade and people across the only land frontier between the UK and an EU state. “We are still operating under what the government says is a severe threat, which means an attack on our members could happen at any time and is highly likely,” he said. “If we are saying in the future that police officers could be deployed to customs posts and other fixed points on a hardened border then they would become static targets. They would in effect become sitting ducks for the terrorists.” The police rank and file’s warning comes in a week of major political turbulence in Northern Ireland. As the row over a bungled green energy scheme costing hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ money pushes the Stormont assembly to the edge of collapse, the Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, said on Sunday that the UK government did not want to reimpose direct rule from London on the region.\\nSpeaking on the Andrew Marr show, he ruled out joint authority over Northern Ireland between the British and Irish governments if the parties fail to reach a deal after elections that now appear inevitable. “I’m not contemplating any alternatives to devolved government in Northern Ireland,” he said. “That is my absolute and resolute faith … My responsibility is to see that we are working with each of the parties to ensure that we are not looking at greater division.” Brokenshire stressed, however, that the region will not be excluded from Brexit negotiations that are due to begin by the end of March. Lindsay said his federation was not making a political comment on Brexit, but “simply raising practical, operational policing concerns”. “Because on a very pragmatic level we wouldn’t even have the numbers to police a hard border. We are between 600 to 700 officers short of the peace-time level of policing numbers as recommended under Chris Patten’s police reforms for Northern Ireland. It would simply not be practical to police a hard border.” He said the reinforcement of a post-Brexit frontier would also be a “retrograde step in relations between the community and policing”. “Last year one of our members, Sergeant Sam Hoey, won a Queen’s Policing Medal for services to the community in Crossmaglen, South Armagh. I remember a time during the Troubles when you could only move about that area via helicopter and with about 16 armed squaddies accompanying your police patrol,” he said. “Sam has established brilliant relations with the local community and he and his fellow officers can move about what was once one of the most dangerous areas to police in their patrols cars, doing ordinary police work, helping the people there. “Imagine the damage to community-police relations if officers were redeployed to fixed border installations after Brexit … The only people to gain would be the terrorists, who would see these installations as a propaganda gift.”\\nLindsay pointed out that there are only a handful of Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) stations still open along the border, which stretches from outside Derry city in the north-west to Newry and the Mournes in the south-east of the province, a result of major cuts in policing resources. “On a basic level it is simply impractical to ask the police to impose a hard border and not only because of our reduced numbers that are again, I stress, below the peace-time levels recommended by Patten. “There are only a handful of stations at places like Newry, Crossmaglen and Strabane still operating. What’s more there are hundreds of small cross points and roads that were opened during the peace process, which are unlikely to be shut off again by ‘dragons teeth’ type barriers. “That would be politically unacceptable to all sides of the community, so what are we saying here? Police should just do fixed patrolling on the main routes between north and south while these smaller roads remain open? What would be the point of that?” Lindsay said his members preferred to operate intelligence-led policing operations along the border in close cooperation with the Garda Síochána, the police force in the Irish Republic. The New IRA, Continuity IRA and Óglaigh na hÉireann - the three main republican paramilitary organisations opposed to the peace process - have continued to target and try to kill members of the PSNI.\\nSince 2009 dissident republican paramilitaries have murdered two PSNI officers, constables Stephen Carroll and Ronan Kerr, and have attempted to murder at least a dozen other officers, including a number who work and live in border communities. Dozens of others attempted sorties on police, military and civilian targets have been thwarted by north-south police cooperation and shared intelligence. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, and her cabinet colleagues have insisted they are opposed to reimposing a hard border after Brexit that might resemble the heavily militarised frontier during the Troubles, with static army checkpoints and spy installations on hilltops over major north-south arterial routes. Brokenshire told the Guardian in September that he preferred shifting immigration controls to the Irish Republic’s ports and airports to avoid having to introduce a hard border between north and south after the UK leaves the EU.', 'Nissan will conduct a review of its Sunderland plant’s competitiveness once the UK’s future relationship with the EU is settled, the head of the Japanese carmaker has said. Carlos Ghosn’s remarks on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos may raise concerns about the commitment of company to the UK, following its pledge in October to turn the factory into one of the biggest car plants in the world. The government has faced questions about the “support and assurances” given to Nissan before the company’s October’s announcement that new versions of its Qashqai and X-Trail would be made in the north-east of England, turning Sunderland into a “super plant” producing more than 600,000 cars a year.\\nGhosn was reported as saying that Nissan trusted Theresa May’s assurances, but that the company would need to review the situation. “Obviously when the package comes, you are going to have to re-evaluate the situation, and say, ‘OK, is the competitiveness of your plant preserved or not?’ “We are going to have to make decisions on investment within the next two to three years, so obviously the faster the Brexit results come, the better it is,” Reuters quoted Ghosn as saying. The government has refused to publish the letter to Nissan in which assurances were given by Greg Clark, the business secretary. May, who set out her vision for a post-Brexit Britain in a speech on Tuesday, was in Davos to meet bankers and business leaders. In a keynote address she urged delegates to address the effects of globalisation. A senior Toyota executive at the Swiss ski resort told the Financial Times that the carmaker’s UK plants also needed to be competitive after Brexit. Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota’s chair, said: “We have seen the direction of the prime minister of the UK, [so] we are now going to consider, together with the suppliers, how our company can survive.”', 'In her landmark speech on Tuesday, Theresa May set out the UK’s priorities for Brexit – and it’s clear that young people are not among them.\\nMay revealed that Britain will leave the single market, the customs union and court jurisdiction when it leaves the EU. But the 12-point plan ignored the younger generation and failed to offer any reassurance on the main issues affecting home and international students. If Brexit did actually mean breakfast, this would be the full English of bad news. Here are five ways the negotiations will affect students and young people: 1. Our horizons will be narrower The PM’s decision to quit the single market in favour of a trade agreement will affect our ability to live, study and work in Europe. Any of the alternatives, she said, would “mean not leaving the EU at all.” The announcement will not put many young people at ease. Plans for what happens after Britain leaves – and how many hoops we might have to jump through in order to spend some time in Europe – are still incredibly hazy. Many students, especially those taking degrees with a year abroad, are right to worry that travelling to EU countries could become more complicated, even for education, and that our ability to work there in the future may be restricted. At worst, our freedom of movement could be taken away altogether. 2. EU students in the UK face an uncertain future\\nTaking back control over our borders is paramount for the prime minister, yet she hasn’t given much indication of the kind of immigration system she wants for Britain after we leave.\\nWhat we do know is that the number of EU students is likely to nosedive as a result of Brexit. University applications from the EU are already down by 9% for the next academic year. We want the brightest people from around the world to continue coming to study and work alongside us in the UK, but hostility towards immigrants and uncertainty over their future status has already been cited as a deterrent. 3. Erasmus is under threat The promise of a “clean break” from the EU puts increased threat on future students’ chances of a year abroad under the Erasmus scheme – one of the outstanding successes of the European project. The government has already dodged opportunities to commit to the exchange programme, which has helped more than 200,000 UK students since it started in 1987, and a special arrangement is likely to be low on the negotiating agenda. We’re yet to see whether universities minister Jo Johnson, who studied in France and Belgium, will intervene.\\n4. Our universities will take a big financial hit Vice-chancellors have already warned that the kind of hard Brexit proposed yesterday could cause the “biggest disaster” in higher education for many years. May’s speech gave no indication of protecting or replacing the current EU funding that British universities receive. EU research money generated more than £1.86bn for the UK economy in 2014-15 alone. 5. Our futures look ever more precarious The prime minister has said that if she doesn’t get what she wants in a “bold and ambitious” trade agreement with the EU, she will “change the basis of Britain’s economic model”. We have no guarantee that the economy won’t suffer, which leaves the younger generation vulnerable.\\nWe’re in a precarious position as it is, burdened by student debt, poor employment prospects and an impenetrable housing market. Anxiety over whether to go to university in the first place, let alone how we’ll get by once we graduate, will only become a bigger issue. And whatever promises Donald Trump makes about British prospects post-Brexit, students remain at the back of the queue.

He asked why, given that Britain’s jobs, living standards and future prosperity were at stake, her speech was not delivered in parliament. He appealed to May to stop her threat of “a bargain basement Brexit”, which would reduce Britain to a tax haven off the shores of the EU. May retorted by quoting Corbyn saying that, like her, he wanted access to the single market, and concluded: “I have a plan, he doesn’t have a clue.”\\nCorbyn followed up by saying that May had threatened to slash corporation tax if Britain did not get a deal on Brexit, which would cost the country £120bn. How would she fund public services? May replied that she had said during the remain campaign that if Britain left the EU the sky would not fall in, but Labour’s plans, including a maximum wage cap, would result in “no jobs, no wages and no skills”. The Labour leader replied that May was refusing to answer how much the UK would have to pay for access to the single market, and pointed out that thousands of workers from the EU are employed in Britain’s public services – including 55,000 by the NHS. Public services are under pressure from her cuts in the social care budget, not from migration, he said. May responded that workers would still come to Britain from the EU, but that the nation would be making its own decisions over migration. As a parting shot, she said: “When I look at Brexit, I consider the issue, I set out my plan and I stick to it – it’s called leadership, he should try it some time.” Snap verdict Perhaps Corbyn should stick to the NHS. Of course, that wasn’t really an option today, in the light of the huge interest in May’s Brexit speech, but having done well on health and social care in recent PMQs he came slightly unstuck when he tried to dismantle her speech with six questions all focused on Europe. His point about May snubbing parliament was true, but a process point of little interest to people outside Westminster, and his “Irony Lady” line was groan-inducing. (He should just have nicked the line that Labour MP Stephen Doughty used yesterday about May and how “the lady’s not for turning up”.) His point about corporation tax and May’s threat to turn the UK into a offshore tax haven was a good one, but then he got sidelined into slightly obtuse questions about payments to the EU, where May’s reply (there will be payments for single market access, even if she is not saying how much they will be) was unusually direct by PMQs standards. May seemed more confident than at previous PMQs, and her mockery of Corbyn’s response to her speech on Tuesday was effective. She will be satisfied that she saw Corbyn off. Memorable lines “Restoring parliamentary democracy while sidelining parliament? She’s not so much the Iron Lady as the Irony Lady.” – Jeremy Corbyn on Theresa May snubbing parliament and the Brexit committee’s call for a white paper. “I’ve got a plan, he doesn’t have a clue.” – May, after quoting Corbyn saying that Labour wants access to the single market after Brexit.

Click here to read more of Andrew Sparrow’s verdicts on PMQS.', 'It is one of the most basic of political lessons to interpret events so that they support your argument. Theresa May has taken this workaday truth and developed it into an overarching narrative for her Brexit strategy. She is well on her way to pulling off an act of national self-harm, and in the total absence of a counter-strategy she is running away with the ball. It was there again in her Lancaster House speech yesterday, this misconstruction of the leave vote: “The message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear,” she told the ambassadors and hacks gathered in surroundings of gilded imperial glory: “Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe.” That is not true. As many of the Vote Leave campaigners were anxious to argue (and the British Election Study (BES) confirms), the Brexit vote was not about immigration. Immigration was never top of the list of concerns of leave voters, and it has only very rarely been top of the concerns of voters in national elections. The leave vote was about a complex web of issues to do with a sense of powerlessness, nostalgia, and a mistrust of people in general and experts in particular. It is not, however, an accident that immigration has come to stand as shorthand for all of the above. In the years of Labour dominance, the idea that immigration was the source of many of voters’ grievances, and that controlling it would be a magic bullet, was deliberately fostered by a Conservative party that couldn’t think of anything better to say to rival new Labour’s appeal.\\nFrom William Hague’s asylum clampdown pledge in 2001 to Michael Howard’s 2005 cap on asylum to David Cameron’s 2010 catastrophic decision to compromise his moderniser message with a promise to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, immigration controls have become the default escape route of the desperate politician fleeing electoral firestorm. Conservative policy moved from being casual about nurturing positive public attitudes to immigration to deliberately legitimising hostility. From the early decision to cut the migration impact funds that Tony Blair had proposed in 2005 in order to tackle the sense of exclusion that was growing in poorer communities, to the “go home” vans, it is scarcely surprising that the BES analysis of the Brexit vote finds a lethal correlation between hostility to immigration and a sense of disempowerment. Modernising Tories call their traditional policy strengths on crime and immigration the “old ladies”. When it seemed Gordon Brown might call a snap election in 2007, Cameron dusted them down and sent them out, and they’ve been on active duty ever since. Yet May’s conspicuous focus on the net migration target as home secretary clearly has more to it than mere loyalty to the party line. Here was a pledge that could not be achieved while Britain was in the EU, a pledge that if it was achieved would severely constrict economic growth, that would unavoidably sour relations with the fastest growing regions of the world, and cripple higher education along the way.\\nShe turned the pledge that Cameron had resorted to into her own. She fought epic and angry battles with economic ministers in cabinet to protect it. She sent out her junior ministers to fight for it. As a result, the stubbornly rising figure for net migration, now three times higher than the original pledge, is a quarterly rebuke to the government, a knife turned in the open wound of failure. Always in the public eye, never far from the front pages of the tabloids, it has acted like a fuel propellant on popular alienation from Westminster and Brussels. There is something attractively novel in a prime minister with a sense of obligation to the promises made in manifestos, in the strict terms in which they are made. There is a good case to make for the claim that such loyalty to the idea of democracy is a necessary precondition to restoring confidence in Westminster. But there is something dangerously perverse in it too. May’s determination to interpret the leave vote as a vote about immigration is a misframing that will have catastrophic consequences. Out of the single market, out of the EU: like politicians who refused to rearm in the 1930s because they hesitated to warn the country it would have to fight another war, May is squandering all the things that her speeches suggest she went into politics to achieve. Her promises to share prosperity more equally and to protect against the bad times more fairly are likely to be the first casualties of this false interpretation of her duty to democracy.', 'In the debate about the government’s Brexit strategy, a good deal of ink has been spilt on the finer distinctions of the single market and the customs union.\\nTuesday’s speech by the prime minister – which confirmed she plans to take Britain out of the single market and parts of the customs union – will doubtless lead to more. But I’m not sure how much clarity this debate has provided – or will provide. In my Bloomberg speech last December, I attempted to put Labour’s position succinctly by focusing on function not form. I indicated then that Labour would push for a Brexit model that maintains and protects our ability to successfully trade goods with and deliver services to the EU. I spelt out what that meant: a model that ensures continued tariff-free trade for UK businesses with the EU; a model that ensures any new regulatory frameworks do not add bureaucratic burdens or risk harmful divergence from the EU market; a model that protects the competitiveness of our services and manufacturing sectors; and a model that ensures that existing protections at work provided by the EU are maintained. Having travelled across the country in the last three months, it is clear to me that businesses, both large and small, as well as many trade unions and working people, agree with this approach.\\nOn Tuesday, Theresa May accepted the importance of these demands and promised to aim for “tariff-free trade with Europe” and a “comprehensive” free trade agreement that would ensure the “freedom to provide financial services across national borders”. She also stated that she wanted to “protect the rights of workers” set out in European legislation.’ That was the right thing to do. It is also important that the prime minister finally accepted Labour’s demand for there to be a vote on the final Brexit deal. This will ensure there is proper grip in the process and a key role for parliament in holding the government to account. But there were also significant gaps in the prime minister’s speech – in particular over how she plans to deliver on these objectives. That will take a lot of explaining, and she is taking a significant risk by giving up on membership of the single market and parts of the customs union. This will alarm many businesses and trade unions, so it is vital the government now produces robust economic analysis and a plan for delivery to support her decision. The prime minister’s comment that the government does “not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” also leaves serious questions about our future role in a wide range of common EU agencies. Does this mean, for example, that we will soon be outside of the European Aviation Safety Agency, which certifies aircraft before they are allowed to fly? The European Medicines Agency, which ensures all medicines in the EU market are safe and effective? Or Europol and Eurojust – agencies I worked closely with when I was the director of public prosecutions and I know have been vital in tackling cross-border crime and terrorism? If so, this would be profoundly counterproductive. This uncertainty is compounded by the prime minister’s threat to “change the basis of Britain’s economic model” if she fails to get the agreement she wants. We have to assume this is not a hollow threat and that the prime minister is willing to rip up many of the economic policies and principles that have guided successive UK governments for decades. This brings into question her commitment to a whole host of social, economic and workplace rights. There is no mandate for the government to do this and it would – contrary to the prime minister’s belief – be an act of self-harm for Britain, and diminish our place in the world.\\nLabour will of course fight against this throughout the negotiating process. We are also actively considering amendments to any legislation the prime minister may be required to introduce after the Supreme Court makes its imminent ruling on the article 50 case. So while we did not learn everything about the prime minister’s intentions for Brexit, we did learn more. Frankly it is extraordinary it has taken this long, and that the prime minister chose to make this announcement in a speech rather than in parliament. But there is now the basis of a plan. The prime minister owns it, and the decision to take Britain out of the single market is hers alone. What matters now is how she delivers the aspirations she has set out. That is how this prime minister and this government will be judged. Labour will hold her to account every step of the way.', 'European politicians and multinational bosses lined up to warn Theresa May the UK’s exit from the European Union will be fraught with difficulty, as the prime minister flew out to deliver her “global Britain” message to business leaders in Davos. Key Brussels negotiators told the prime minister she was being over-optimistic in her hope to achieve a quick, clean break from the EU – and industrialists said her Brexit speech had left UK jobs at risk.\\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit negotiator, cast doubts on a central tenet of May’s plan when he warned that Britain should not expect continued tariff-free access to EU customers while simultaneously rejecting other key elements of the single market, including free movement. In an article for the Guardian, Verhofstadt said: “It is an illusion to suggest that the UK will be permitted to leave the European Union, but then be free to opt back into the best parts of the European project, for example by asking for zero tariffs from the single market, without accepting the obligations that come with it. “I hope that British people will see from the perspective of an EU taxpayer, how unreasonable this would be.” He concludes that Brexit will be “a sad and exhausting process”.\\nJean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, predicted that negotiating Brexit will be “very, very, very difficult” as he responded to May’s speech on Tuesday, because Britain would be considered a foreign country to the rest of the EU. Speaking to journalists in Strasbourg, the president said he had spoken to the British prime minister and told her the commission was not in a hostile mood: “We want a fair deal with Britain and a fair deal for Britain, but a fair deal means a fair deal for the European Union.”\\nMeanwhile, foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who was closely involved in the preparation of May’s speech, sparked a fresh row with politicians elsewhere on the continent by appearing to compare French president François Hollande’s insistence that Britain must receive a worse deal after Brexit to “punishment beatings” administered by second world war prison camp guards. The chairman of Japanese carmaker Toyota said his company, which employs 3,000 people in the UK, was asking itself “how to maintain competitiveness” in its UK operations, after hearing May’s speech. Takeshi Uchiyamada told the Financial Times: “We have seen the direction of the prime minister of the UK, we are now going to consider, together with the suppliers, how our company can survive.” Financial services firms are among those particularly exercised by the risks of losing unfettered access to the EU single market. HSBC’s chairman Stuart Gulliver confirmed yesterday that the bank is ready to move 1,000 jobs out of London, saying, “we will move in about two years’ time when Brexit becomes effective”.\\nMeanwhile, Swiss investment bank UBS told the BBC in Davos that it is also preparing to move 1,000 staff out of London to the continent as May implements her “Plan for Britain”. It also emerged that the prime minister will learn on Tuesday whether she will have to allow for a vote in parliament before triggering article 50, the formal EU divorce process. The supreme court is expected to uphold last autumn’s high court ruling that the approval of MPs and peers is required, meaning that the government will have to table a tightly-worded bill almost immediately. Earlier, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said he was “very determined’ to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and a new trading relationship within the two-year deadline set by article 50. He acknowledged that Britain may not have fully freed itself from European Union rules until 2021, as changes in areas such as immigration, borders or regulation may be introduced gradually but said it would not be overly complicated to resolve. “We’ve said we accept that there may be an implementation phase thereafter,” he told the BBC. “It won’t be a long time ... a year or two.” Davis insisted there would be no difference in Britons’ right to travel in Europe or vice versa but admitted new customs checks could come into force for lorries carrying goods into or out of the UK. German chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the “clarity” provided by May’s speech but said, after talks with the Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, that the remaining EU member states would begin Brexit talks with a united front. She stressed negotiations can only begin when article 50 is triggered. “I am not worried that we won’t stand together,” she said. “The most important thing is that Europe will not let itself be divided, and we will ensure this with very close contact.” Gentiloni agreed there would be “solidarity” among the EU 27, but “also of course friendship” with Britain.\\nMeanwhile, much of the continent’s press was openly scornful of the prime minister’s approach. “Little Britain – May leads Britain into isolation”, was the frontpage headline in Germany’s Die Welt, while Italy’s La Repubblica opted for: “Brexit: London puts up its wall – out of EU and single market”. Even more outspoken was Der Spiegel, which summarised May’s negotiating stance as “I want, I want, I want”. In an article also published in English, the magazine’s UK correspondent said Britain’s plans amounted to “wilful self-mutilation”. In Davos, business leaders have welcomed the certainty brought by May’s twelve-point Brexit plan, but are now preparing to take concrete actions to ready themselves for a world outside the single market. In her speech there on Thursday, May is expected to sound an optimistic note, reiterating that Britain is open for business, and saying she hopes to use Brexit as an opportunity to strengthen its ties with trading partners outside the EU. But the prime minister will also warn Davos delegates – who personify the globe-trotting “citizens of the world” she derided in her Conservative party conference speech – that globalisation must be reformed if it is not to lose the support of left-behind communities. The government has a strong presence at Davos, where business leaders and politicians meet once a year to discuss the state of the global economy. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, and international trade secretary Liam Fox, are both also attending. As well as delivering her speech, May will host a high-level panel on how to tackle modern slavery, an issue on which she has long campaigned.', 'Theresa May has said that Britain will leave the single market as part of its exit from the European Union but that the country would push for the “greatest possible” access to tariff-free trade with Europe as part of a deal. The comments from the prime minister – who also said there would be a phased implementation of the new agreement between Britain and Europe – bring clarity about the shape of the country’s exit from the European Union but will also spark fresh concerns. This is how the major business representatives have reacted.\\nCBI Britain’s largest business group, which supported the country remaining in the European Union, said Theresa May’s speech had “changed the landscape”. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said: “Ruling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a barrier-free trading relationship between the UK and the EU. But businesses will welcome the greater clarity and the ambition to create a more prosperous, open and global Britain, with the freest possible trade between the UK and the EU. “The pressure is now on to deliver these objectives and achieve a smooth and orderly exit. Businesses want to make a success of Brexit but will be concerned about falling back on damaging WTO rules.” British Chambers of Commerce Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, warned that what “really matters” to businesses is what May secures from the negotiations with the EU, not what she bids for. He said: “While businesses now have a clearer sense of the prime minister’s top-line priorities, they will come away from her speech knowing little more about the likely outcome of the Brexit negotiations than they did yesterday. The simple fact is that businesses all across the UK are carrying on. Directly affected companies are being pragmatic, and are preparing for a range of possible outcomes.” Marshall said it was vital that Brexit “must not become all-consuming” and urged the government to focus on “having the right skills, infrastructure and business environment across the UK”. Chartered Management Institute The prime minister’s speech makes it “inevitable” that the number of foreign workers coming to the UK will fall, according to Ann Francke, the chief executive of the CMI. She said: “With the prime minister signalling today that the UK will make a clean break from the EU, it is inevitable that the number of foreign workers coming to the UK will fall after Brexit, so we need to invest heavily in homegrown talent now to ensure that we have the skilled workers capable of plugging the gaps.”\\nRoyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors The housing shortage in Britain could worsen without access to workers in Europe, RICS warned. Jeremy Blackburn, head of policy at RICS, said: “While this clarity is undoubtedly welcome, one thing is clear, a loss of access to the EU’s skilled workforce has the potential to slowly bring the UK’s property and construction sector to a standstill. That means unless alternative plans are put in place, we won’t be able to deliver the thousands of homes needed to solve our housing crisis or create the infrastructure needed to enable our cities to compete on a global stage. Potentially, an embarrassing situation for a government set to publish both its housing white paper and industrial strategy.” CIPD The professional body which represents human resources and people development welcomed the pledges to protect existing employment legislation, but expressed its disappointment that there was no confirmation that EU nationals already residing in the UK will be allowed to stay. Peter Cheese, the chief executive of the CIPD, said: “The prime minister has made it clear that she wants the UK to be able to control its borders. However, it should still be possible to design a flexible, managed immigration system that allows businesses to access the skilled and unskilled labour they need from both EU and non-EU countries. If we are to use Brexit to deliver a global Britain as the prime minister wishes, then British business must be able to continue to attract and access global talent. “It is particularly welcome that the prime minister confirmed that the protections afforded to workers through current employment legislation will continue. Many EU-derived regulations provide vital workplace protections and workers up and down the country will be reassured by the news that their rights will not be sacrificed as part of any deal. However, it is disappointing that the prime minister is currently unable to confirm that EU nationals already residing in the UK will be allowed to stay. This needs to be an immediate priority in the negotiations to come.” Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders Car manufacturers believe that May’s comments about the importance of single market arrangements for the industry is “critical”. Carmakers have previously warned they could pull operations out of Britain without a free-trade arrangement with the rest of Europe, although Nissan last year pledged to expand its operations in Sunderland. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: “We need government to deliver a deal which includes participation in the customs union to help safeguard EU trade, trade that is tariff-free and avoids the non-tariff and regulatory barriers that would jeopardise investment, growth and consumer choice. Achieving this will not be easy and we must, at all costs, avoid a cliff-edge and reversion to WTO tariffs, which would threaten the viability of the industry.” BBA The banking industry welcomed the “important clarity” and “commitment to free trade” in May’s speech. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the BBA, said: “The prime minister has provided important clarity today on the kind of relationship the UK will seek with the EU and we welcome the government’s commitment to free trade with the EU and the rest of the world. “All existing EU member states have a mutual interest in ensuring that there’s a smooth exit. The government’s support for interim arrangements is essential to ensure there are no cliff-edge effects when the UK leaves the EU. “We will continue to work with government and regulators to support its negotiation strategy to agree a new partnership with the EU.” TheCityUK The trade body for Britain’s financial services industry praised the prime minister for highlighting the need for a “bespoke agreement” between Britain and the EU. In comments that could soothe fears that financial services firms will leave the City of London, Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, said: “There is no existing off-the-shelf solution which can deliver the right deal for the UK, the EU and the global economy. The UK-based financial and related professional services industry has consistently called for an ambitious deal with mutual market access between the UK and the EU on terms similar to those currently in place. The prime minister’s intention to see that the UK gets the highest possible access to EU markets supports this objective. “The prime minister recognised the important role the UK plays as Europe’s financial centre. Her assertion that the industry must be able to provide its services cross-border post-Brexit will benefit firms and customers in the UK and the EU. “The prime minister’s commitment to ensuring the UK will be able to continue to attract the best domestic, EU and global talent is welcome. Global businesses must be able to continue to move their staff or operations into the UK to ensure it maintains its global attractiveness into the future.” NFU Farmers still have “legitimate and important concerns” about Brexit despite May bringing some much-needed clarity about the negotiations with the EU, the NFU has warned. The agriculture industry exports 72% of its products to the EU, with £290m out of the £300m annual lamb exports being sold to Europe. The NFU, which is seeking urgent talks with the government, said it was vital that Britain has the best possible access to trade with Europe and access to a “competent and reliable workforce”. It also wants the government to confirm that it sees agriculture as a key industry and ensure that there is a period of transition if there are changes to the trading relationship. The NFU added: “The prime minister has ruled out the UK’s continuing participation in the European single market or the EU customs union and instead has stated her intention to pursue a free trade agreement with the EU. We hope the prime minister’s ambition can be achieved, but as we know these kind of deals normally take years to conclude and do not cover all products.” Federation of Small Businesses Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB, said small businesses wanted a “bold and ambitious” free trade agreement with the EU and that it was vital the prime minister met her pledge to have a period of transition to the new arrangement, thereby avoiding a “cliff-edge”. He said: “One in five FSB members export. This could be doubled with the right tailored small business support from the Department for International Trade along with new free trade agreements with the fastest growing markets in the world. Global trade will only flourish if the free trade agreements prevent additional barriers, such as cost and paperwork. “Small employers will welcome the pledge to maintain the UK as a true magnet for international talent. We have pressed the government hard to guarantee the right to remain for non-UK EU nationals in existing workforces, and no early cut-off date. Any future system must help small firms to easily recruit the right person, for the right job, at the right time.” Institute of Directors Some business leaders will “regret” the prime minister’s pledge to leave the single market, according to the Institute of Directors, which welcomed the “level of detail” provided in May’s speech. Allie Renison, the head of Europe and trade policy at the IoD, said: “Whatever the shape of the final trade deal, a smooth and orderly departure is in the whole country’s interests, so businesses will support the commitment to a phased process of implementation. While we do not expect a running commentary, firms hope to get periodic updates to maintain confidence as we make our way towards the exit. “We now know that we will be leaving the single market, and while there will be firms who regret this, they will at least be able to plan on that basis. Business leaders will be heartened by the prime minister’s strong argument for the value of free trade, an argument currently being made by all too few global leaders. “We would urge the EU to match the government’s approach in taking a long-term, big-picture view about the need for cooperation and partnership in future.” British Retail Consortium May must ensure that a new deal with the EU does not lead to higher shop prices for consumers, according to leading retailers. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: “The prime minister has an ambitious plan with the right priorities. It is crucial that Britain gets a new deal that works for ordinary British consumers, which doesn’t hit them with the costs of new import tariffs at a time when the pound is already weakened. The government has an opportunity to secure a win-win deal that works for the UK economy, by keeping prices down for consumers while allowing the EU to continue benefiting from its open-trade relationship with the UK.” TUC Trade unions echoed the warning from retailers that consumers must not foot the bill for Britain leaving the single market. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “Working people are worried they will end up paying the price of leaving the single market. There is real concern that it will be bad for jobs, bad for rights at work, and bad for the living standards of British people. “The commitment to protect workers’ existing rights and to build on them is welcome. The best way to do this is for the prime minister to agree that UK workers’ rights will always be as good as, or better, than workers’ rights in the rest of the EU.” Business for Scotland The government’s economic strategy is being driven by “old fashioned, isolationist, British nationalism” and May’s negotiating tactics for Brexit “amount to nothing more than sticking her fingers in her ears and humming Rule Britannia”, according to Business for Scotland. Gordon MacIntyre-Kemp, the chief executive of Business for Scotland, said: “Scotland now has a choice between being dragged under with an isolationist, self destructing, distant, disinterested and dysfunctional UK government or planning a route to greater shared prosperity with a fully empowered, independent Scottish government focused on an international, inclusive, civic national identity and economy policy. A second independence referendum is now inevitable and most likely will take place in May 2018.” JCB Lord Bamford, the chairman of JCB and a supporter of Brexit, said: “I am very encouraged by the vision set out by the prime minister today. The UK voted to leave the EU and she is determined to make this happen in a way that restores our sovereignty but which ensures the UK becomes a global leader in free trade. “British business now needs to get behind the government as it sets out to secure the best deal for our country’s future. As the prime minister said, we are leaving the EU but we are not leaving Europe – it will remain an important market for British business but we need to be able to trade freely with the rest of the world as well.”', 'Theresa May has outlined the government’s 12 priorities for Brexit negotiations with the EU. In a pitch that envisioned a “truly global Britain”, May said that “what I am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market”, as well as confirming that parliament would vote on a Brexit deal. May also said that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.”\\nBelow, we hear from some of our readers on the implications of May’s speech – and their concerns and predictions for what happens next. ‘At least we know the general strategy now’\\n‘Shocking and pathetic’\\n‘May was shadow boxing’\\n‘The cleaner the break the better’\\n‘I feel sorry for expats’\\n‘I’m worried about my German wife’s rights’\\n‘We can no longer have our cake and eat it’\\n‘My life has now been designated “negotiation capital”’\\n‘At best delusional’', 'Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next and prominent leave campaigner, has warned the British economy will be “finished” if the government pursues an isolationist Brexit course. The Conservative peer told the Press Association the referendum vote was about UK independence, not isolation, adding that Britain would set itself up for economic failure if it closed itself off from the rest of the world.\\n“I think the hard, soft Brexit language is unhelpful, and what we should be talking about is whether we have an ‘open’ or ‘closed’ Brexit,” he said on the sidelines of a press conference on Thursday. “Britain voted for independence, it didn’t vote for isolation and so we have a choice: are we going to choose to build an open, global-facing economy, or one that’s closed and isolated? If we choose the latter, then our economy is finished. If we choose the former, we stand a chance of flourishing greatly.” Theresa May’s government has indicated it will embark on a so-called hard Brexit by introducing migration curbs and stopping the free movement of EU citizens into Britain. EU leaders have stressed that free movement is a condition for accessing the single market. Lord Wolfson made the comments shortly after announcing that the £250,000 Wolfson economics prize would be awarded to the best solution for funding and overhauling the UK’s road network. Against a backdrop of deep cuts to transport budgets at national and local levels, the prize seeks ideas to bring more investment “and a better deal for road users”. Wolfson, sponsor of the prize, said he wanted entries to embrace the latest digital technologies, new forms of power for cars and lorries and self-driving vehicles. He said Brexit was an opportunity to break from old ways of thinking that prevented new roads being built and existing ones being upgraded. “One of the things that becomes very clear when you look at the challenges our economy will face as we go into Brexit is that we need new ideas to stimulate growth in the UK,” Wolfson said. “Structural reform of our roads is one such idea that could generate an enormous amount of economic growth, which could compensate for some of the inevitable economic shock as we exit the EU.”\\nRejecting concerns that the emphasis would be just on cars and lorries, he said public transport must also be integrated into any plans along with the needs of cyclists. He said the judges expected universities and policymakers from the UK, US, China and across Europe to come up with ideas that answer the question: “How can we pay for better, safer, more reliable roads in a way that is fair to road users and good for the economy and the environment?” Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal & General and the chair of the judging panel, said the Treasury was under pressure to halt a decline in income from road users while at the same time bolster spending on the roads. He said the Treasury received £33bn from road users in fuel tax and excise duties and “would be very interested in ideas in this area” to stop the decline. Wolfson warned that Britain’s roads were in desperate need of investment, which was not so much about a new motorway or upgrade, but thousands of smaller initiatives to bring the network into the 21st century. Kingman, who was a senior official at the Treasury before joining L&G, said Britain’s record of investment was weak in recent years, partly due to protests from special interest groups. “We have a problem because we are a crowded island, but we shouldn’t be defeatist about this. We have cracked many problems in the past,” he said. “We are particularly interested in how new technologies can address these issues and convince the public that it is possible. This is not a prize just for innovative ideas but ones that are workable and can be sold to the public.” The contest is free to enter and open to anyone. It is sponsored by the Charles Wolfson Charitable Trust and managed by Policy Exchange, the free market thinktank. The deadline for submissions is Thursday 2 March 2017. A shortlist will be announced in April and the prize will be awarded at a ceremony in July. Judges include Alistair Darling, a former chancellor of the exchequer, Isabel Dedring, a former London deputy mayor for transport, and Bridget Rosewell, a former chief economist to the Greater London Authority and founder of the Volterra Partners consultancy.', 'Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, will warn on Wednesday that the Brexit plan outlined in Theresa May’s speech on Tuesday could “rip Britain apart”, striking a markedly different tone to the Labour frontbench. Khan, a former Tooting MP, will tell an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos that “hard Brexit would be a lose-lose situation”. On May’s speech, he says: “A hardline approach to Brexit may hold the Conservative party together, but it could rip Britain apart. “And if we continue on this path – towards a hard Brexit – we risk having to explain to future generations why we knowingly put their economy, their prosperity and their place on the world stage in such peril.” He will say that privileged access to the single market is “critical for London” – that nothing else will do.\\nKhan’s tough approach comes amid growing disquiet among Labour MPs, including some frontbenchers, about whether Jeremy Corbyn, and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, were too generous to the prime minister after her Brexit speech. May’s “plan for Britain”, involves leaving the EU single market, and dropping key aspects of the customs union – but seeking a wide-ranging trade deal with the rest of the EU. Corbyn offered strong resistance to May’s threat to turn Britain into what he characterised as a “bargain basement” on the shores of Europe, but both he and Starmer welcomed her decision to seek “access” to the single market, instead of trying to retain membership. Khan is sometimes touted as a potential future Labour leader, and his party conference speech in September, with its repeated references to “Labour in power”, was widely regarded as a dig at Corbyn and his low poll ratings. Labour is in an awkward position, seeking to square the circle between its pro-remain members and voters, and the profound concerns of some of its traditional supporters in former industrial areas about immigration. Moderate MPs, including former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Progress chair Alison McGovern, have warned that their party must offer what McGovern, in an article for Labour List, called, “real opposition to what May announced yesterday”.', 'Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain edges towards the EU exit door. If you’d like to receive it as a weekly early-morning email, please sign up here. A quick heads-up: the third of our Brexit means … podcasts is now live and you can listen to it here. This time we delve into the vexed question of EU citizens’ rights in the UK after Brexit with the Guardian’s Lisa O’Carroll, Nicolas Hatton of the3million, immigration lawyer Andrew Tingley and Polish journalist Jakub Krupa. Also, producing the Guardian’s independent, in-depth journalism takes a lot of time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters – and it might well be your perspective, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you. The big picture Brexit will be hard rather than soft, and clean rather than messy. In other words, it’s goodbye to the single market and customs union, and hello to (at best) a short, defined “implementation phase”, but certainly not a drawn-out transition. That, at least, was the gist of the briefings coming out of Downing Street and the pro-Brexit camp ahead of Theresa May’s big speech on Tuesday, in which she was due to lay out her Brexit plan before article 50 is triggered before the end of March. Government warnings of a possible market reaction to the speech (sterling slipped to its lowest since October even before it was delivered) were seen as confirming the prime minister’s likely thrust, as were some uncharacteristically hardline comments from the chancellor.\\nPhilip Hammond, generally seen as a “soft” Brexiter, used an interview with Welt am Sonntag to issue what amounted to a veiled threat to the EU 27 that if Britain does not get a fair trade deal it may turn itself into a low-tax rival: You can be sure we will do whatever we have to do. The British people are not going to lie down and say ‘too bad, we’ve been wounded’. We will change our model, and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged. Donald Trump’s subsequent words, in an interview with the Times, could have been designed to reinforce the message. Brexit, the president-elect said, would be “a great thing”, a trade deal between Britain and the US could be agreed “very quickly”, and the EU, like Nato, was pretty much dead in the water anyway. Happy days. The view from Europe In what some will see as heartening news, Michel Barnier, the European commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, said he wanted a “special” post-Brexit relationship with the City because of its importance to the EU as a financial centre, according to unpublished minutes of a meeting with MEPs: Some very specific work has to be done in this area. There will be a special/specific relationship. There will need to be work outside of the negotiation box … in order to avoid financial instability.\\nHe subsequently rowed back from what might have been the first hint of a chink in the EU’s Brexit armour, tweeting that what he had actually said was that the EU would need “special vigilance on financial stability risk”, not a special deal to access the City. Whatever he did or did not say exactly, Barnier’s comments followed remarks in a similar vein by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who told the Treasury select committee that the City was vital to Europe: If you rely on a jurisdiction for three-quarters of your hedging activities, three-quarters of your foreign exchange activity, half your lending and half your securities transactions you should think very carefully about the transition. In an intervention that could prove equally decisive for the final shape of Brexit, the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, confirmed that although it may be “quite obvious” that the City could be in line for a transition deal, EU law would continue to apply in Britain until the UK formally leaves. It is not a transition period where British institutions take over, but it is a transition period where the European court of justice is still in charge of dishing out judgments and points of view. Germany’s centre-left SPD party, meanwhile, said it would be prepared to prioritise “the unity of the EU” over the country’s short-term economic interests, while the Dutch deputy prime minister, Lodewijk Asscher, said the Netherlands would block any EU trade deal with the UK unless it signs up to tough tax avoidance regulations. Meanwhile, back in Westminster A much-touted tweak to Labour’s stance on immigration was due to be the centrepiece of a promised “relaunch” of leader Jeremy Corbyn, featuring the message that the party now accepts the need for more managed entry to the UK. In the event, his words were rather drowned out by some slightly mixed comments he gave about the possible need for a maximum wage cap – and what he did eventually say about immigration was not wholly clear anyway. Labour was “not wedded to freedom of movement for EU citizens [into the UK] as a point of principle”, Corbyn said, before adding helpfully: “I don’t want that to be misinterpreted; nor do we rule it out.” Tristram Hunt, another backbencher, announced his departure, leading to a potentially tricky byelection in his Stoke on Trent seat. But away from internal politics, the cross-party select committee on Brexit, chaired by Labour’s Hilary Benn, said the government must seek a transitional arrangement to avoid a “cliff edge” Brexit, and offer parliament a vote on the final deal: We’re not asking the government to give away its red lines or negotiating fall-back positions, but we do want clarity on its broad aims given the significance and complexity of the negotiating task. You should also know: Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, warned the government of the risks of a “disorderly crash landing” and the limitations of WTO terms. Two more Brexit court cases are being launched in Dublin and London, adding to the government’s legal woes. No 10 distanced itself from a proposal by immigration minister Robert Goodwill for a £1,000-a-year levy on EU skilled workers. The FTSE reached new highs on the back of continued sterling weakness. UK voters back the Conservative party to negotiate the best Brexit terms by three to one. Britain is to begin talks with New Zealand on a post-Brexit trade deal. A Dutch woman resident in UK for 30 years was told she may have to leave. Foreign minister Boris Johnson “punched the air like Maradona” after the Brexit vote, said Dominic Cummings, campaign director of Vote Leave. A bunch of Brexit-inspired novels are set for publication in 2017. Read these In the Guardian, Matthew d’Ancona argues that “Brexit is the easy bit”, pointing out that once Britain is out, the relationship with the EU that follows – not just trade but in areas like patent protection and policing – could take years to define. There’s a model for how May will tackle the task, he suggests: Those who know May well suggest that a precedent is under our very noses. As home secretary she opted out of 130 EU crime and policing measures – before opting back in to 35, including the European arrest warrant. This, broadly, is the model she will try to follow. Dominic Cummings’ blogpost on how Vote Leave won the referendum (see above) is very long but enthralling if you’re into that kind of thing, full of juicy anecdotes but above all an object lesson in successful campaigning: I found 10-15 highly motivated people who knew what they were doing and largely left them to get on with it while stopping people who did not know what they were doing interfering with them. We worked out a psychologically compelling, simple story, and we applied some simple management principles. It is hard to overstate the relative importance in campaigns of message over resources. In the FT (paywall), Janan Ganesh provides the most eloquent exposition yet of the argument that far from being vague, vacillating and indecisive, May knows exactly what she wants and has said so all along – it’s just that a lot of people didn’t want to hear it: It is possible to predict, in rough terms, not just the exit deal she will sign but the Britain she will try to craft afterwards. Her commitment to the slower, more familiar nation of her youth, even at the cost of economic dynamism, is clear enough to anyone with the ears to pick it up and the stomach to accept it … For the first time in my life, Britain has a prime minister who would forgo some economic growth for some social order. Tweet of the week David Allen Green: a man who does not mince his words …', 'Theresa May’s Brexit speech is billed as a moment of clarity and an end to “cake and eat it” platitudes. But the words she chooses cannot hide several potential sticking points: Transition Though preferring the phrase “implementation phase” to “transitional deal”, the government has accepted the need for British business to have some warning of changed trading arrangements in Europe. The rub is that the EU has insisted Britain remains under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice during any such interim arrangement, directly threatening one of May’s other stated objectives. Watch to see whether she talks about a phased withdrawal from the ECJ to see if this point has sunk in, or whether the dream of orderly transition is merely a temporary sop to jittery business leaders. Single market Most expect May to acknowledge that leaving the EU automatically means leaving the single market. But losing preferential access to the single market is another thing entirely. Ideally the government would negotiate replacement trade arrangements, but European leaders wish to limit these to deter others from leaving the EU. Watch to see whether May promises some other form of barrier-free access for UK exporters, or simply states it as an objective. The latter would suggest we may be heading for much more limited World Trade Organisation tariffs instead. Citizens’ rights The government initially favoured an upfront deal to guarantee the rights of existing EU citizens in exchange for similar “grandfathering” of Brits on the continent. But the difficulty of amending European treaties in this way has meant existing immigrants are still very much pawns in the upcoming negotiations. This is a source of much anguish on both sides of the Channel, and May could take the heat out of proceedings if she were to hint at a unilateral guarantee of residency rights. An absence of this in the speech would suggest tensions will only grow as it becomes clear we are effectively holding EU citizens to ransom. Money Tensions have grown in recent days as the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England have warned that a disorderly Brexit will hurt the EU, both by increasing financial instability and encouraging Britain to undercut tax rates. Previously, London had struck a more conciliatory tone over money, hinting that it would continue to make payments into the EU budget in return for market access. There was only limited pushback when Brussels hinted at a huge divorce settlement to pay for outstanding liabilities. If May continues to take the more parsimonious tone of late, it suggests a happy ending is unlikely. Bankers Fresh pessimism over EU trade prospects has swept the City of London this month, as evidenced by sharp falls in the value of the pound. When it comes to their own access arrangements, bankers are particularly gloomy about any continuation of “passporting” arrangements for financial services. Many are now pushing for an improvement on “equivalence” rules instead, through mutual recognition of financial regulation. Whether May encourages this thinking will say much about how worried she is about bankers leaving the City, or whether they are now politically acceptable collateral damage.', 'The advantage of the prime minister’s speech being leaked in advance is obvious: two successive days of adoring front-page headlines for Theresa May. As far as the Daily Mail is concerned, Margaret Thatcher has been reborn: “Steel of the new Iron Lady”. Other headlines on six successive pages reflect its ecstasy at her decision to quit the single market, renegotiate customs union membership and dispense with the European court of justice: “A great nation is reborn”; “Europe split over May’s vision – but even Tusk calls it ‘realistic’; “Thumbs up from bosses”.\\nAn op-ed by Dominic Sandbrook calls the speech daring, decisive and momentous and compared May favourably to Thatcher. As for the editorial, it praises an “impressive” May for presenting a vision of Britain “as a fully independent, global power”. It continues: “Mrs May left our partners in no doubt that if they fail to offer the right terms, she is ready to walk away from the table and out of the EU with no agreement at all … “In a subtle yet undisguised threat, she reminded them gently that a trade war would jeopardise EU firms’ £500bn investments in Britain. It would also put at risk millions of European jobs that are dependent on exports to the UK worth £290bn a year.” No, I agree, not really much of a surprise. The Brexit-campaigning Mail has been May’s greatest supporter from the moment she emerged as the woman most likely to succeed David Cameron. As unsurprising is the joy evident from the coverage in the Sun (with a punning front page headline, “Brexodus”, on a mocked-up tablet of stone), the Daily Express (“Deal or no deal we will leave the EU”) and the Daily Telegraph (“May’s bold terms for Brexit”). In its editorial, the Sun says May’s Brexit vision “is so close to ours we couldn’t have written it any better. It was a magnificent, historic speech – a game-changer for Britain and for Brussels”. It calls her speech “hugely ambitious, optimistic and crafted to appeal to every level-headed person in Britain”. As for EU members “she was commendably steely in urging them to focus on the potential gains for both sides, not on ‘punishing’ Britain”. But the Sun has “two reservations”. It is worried about possible drift during the transitional period between the day Britain leaves and new deals taking effect. And it is troubled by the fact that parliament will get a final vote. Why? Because “it provides a focal point for two more grim years of divisive campaigning by diehard Remainers still hoping to turn back the clock”. The Telegraph, which carries an op-ed by Boris Johnson heaping praise upon his leader, joins in the adulation. It was an “excellent speech” offering a “clear sense of direction; this was real leadership, of the sort we see all too rarely.\\n“It is no exaggeration to describe this speech as a defining moment in British politics, one that will one day be remembered in the same light as Lady Thatcher’s famous Bruges address, which launched the modern Eurosceptic movement.” According to the paper, “we will remain a pro-immigration society but will choose who we want to move here … a masterclass in common sense and is exactly what Britain voted for last June”. It is particularly pleased at the “steel behind her words: Britain can be a good friend to the EU, or a bad enemy. And the EU today needs all the friends it can get”. And it concludes: “The prime minister is doing what Britain wants, and doing it boldly. She deserves to succeed.” The Telegraph columnist Philip Johnston also praises the speech, arguing that it lived up to its advance billing of being “major” and “groundbreaking”. Stephen Pollard, in the Express, sees it in similar terms, “as the most important single speech by any British politician in my lifetime”. In an adjacent leader, the Express reminds readers that “this newspaper began its crusade to get Britain out of the EU more than six years ago”. Now, “at last, we have a prime minister who … understands the importance of delivering a real Brexit”. The caption to the Times’s front-page picture of May striding into Lancaster House informs its readers that she is wearing “a £1,190 Vivienne Westwood suit”. Is that relevant?\\nAs for the speech, its assessment is more measured. Impressed by how she “pulled off the trick of sounding both conciliatory and menacing”, it sees it as clever, nuanced “and arguably a fine one”. It believes that May will have silenced those who said she did not know what she was doing and that her remarks “were meant chiefly to reassure critics at home that after six months with no running commentary she has a plan”. The Times notes how the “shrewd advance briefing” of key sections of her speech “meant that any anxiety in the financial markets had been factored into the price of sterling” before she spoke. It concludes by referring to an unnamed City trader who had welcomed the speech as “less hawkish” than expected: “This is an accolade that would have been hard to imagine last summer. Mrs May has deftly moved the goalposts to give herself the option of the hardest of hard Brexits.” Then there are those titles that backed remain and are now doubtful about the government’s interpretation of its mandate following the referendum vote. The Guardian thinks the speech “doubly depressing” and “riddled with its own streak of global fantasy”. It was, says the paper, “a reminder that Britain’s exit from the EU puts livelihoods, values and alliances at risk”. May’s approach was influenced by her “conviction that the people voted for Brexit to control EU migration” and that “the Conservative party’s anti-European MPs are politically stronger, and thus more of a destabilising threat to her premiership, than the party’s pro-Europeans”. Moreover, it was also “designed in equal parts to pander to the xenophobic press, and to keep backbench Brexiteers firmly on side”. So, says the Guardian, “as a political manoeuvre” it “was a huge success” and will have strengthened her authority both in her party and in the country.\\nAs for her saying that no deal would be better than a bad deal, the paper believes it to be “a bluff” which “may backfire at the negotiating table”. Rafael Behr, writing in the Guardian, contends that May’s speech “was meant to be a beacon illuminating Britain’s future outside the EU. But, coming days before Trump’s inauguration, it should be read also as an unwitting requiem for the global order that is passing away”. The Independent’s leader is unequivocally hostile to May’s speech, seeing her message as “extremely unwelcome” by offering a “damaging and undemocratic” Brexit. It continues: “The terms she is talking about were not promised by the leave campaign in the referendum.” Although May has agreed to obtain the consent of parliament to the eventual terms of exit, “the option to remain within the EU will not be on the table. For parliament and people, that is unacceptable.” “She should, of course, have pledged a referendum for the whole of the British people on such a momentous move … it is more certain than ever that she is leading the country and her party into a certainly disastrous economic future – and will ignore the popular will.” The Daily Mirror, ever aware of its readership being more anti-EU than its own long-held EU enthusiasm, is cautious. It says May “must be held to account closely as she initiates a tricky exit that will determine our country’s prosperity for generations to come”. It wonders whether controlling migration from the EU, “which many people [meaning its readers] demand”, could prove counterproductive. “Everybody wants to approach the future positively,” says the Mirror, “and it is in all our interests that a good deal is reached with other nations.” And finally, let me mention a couple of half-decent headline puns in two free titles: “Don’t call me May be” (Metro) and “It’s May way or the highway” (City AM).', 'Theresa May will lay out her plans for Britain’s exit from the European Union on Tuesday, in a major speech that will be closely scrutinised in financial markets, and by other European leaders. The prime minister has come under intense political pressure to reveal more details of her negotiating priorities before she triggers article 50, the formal divorce process from the EU. May promised senior MPs before Christmas that she would make a speech in the new year, “setting out more about our approach and about the opportunity I think we have as a country to use this process to forge a truly global Britain that embraces and trades with countries across the world”. She has signalled some key principles, including taking control of immigration, and leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which polices the single market. May has also promised MPs she will publish a “plan” but Downing Street would not say whether it would be produced alongside the speech. Some MPs hoped for a formal government white paper; but it is expected to be a slimmer document, setting out a menu of options. The pound fell sharply on the foreign exchanges after she announced those priorities in her party conference speech, which traders interpreted as pointing to a so-called “hard Brexit”. May has since pledged to deliver a “red, white and blue Brexit”, and stressed that she wants the best “trade deal” possible with the EU. But she has offered few other clues about her stance – Ivan Rogers, the government’s most senior representative at the EU, abruptly resigned earlier this month warning against “muddled thinking”, amid a turf war between Whitehall departments about who will run the negotiations. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “The prime minister must take this opportunity to reassure the country that she has a plan for Brexit and that she will fight for a deal that prioritises jobs, the economy and delivers trading arrangements that are free of tariffs and bureaucratic impediments. With just 10 or 11 weeks to go before the triggering of article 50, time is running out.” The speech will come as the government awaits the verdict in the supreme court appeal that will determine whether it must consult parliament before pressing ahead with Brexit. Ministers have prepared more than one draft of a bill that could be tabled urgently if, as they expect, the government loses. MPs have held a series of debates about Brexit, with another, about the impact on the rural economy, due to be held next week. But some, including many on the Conservative benches, are concerned about the lack of clarity on a series of questions, including whether the government hopes to remain within the customs union. Pro-EU Conservatives, including Anna Soubry and Ben Howlett, plan to band together with likeminded MPs from other parties to try to force a backbench debate specifically on the single market, perhaps as soon as next week. Soubry said in the House of Commons on Thursday: “As we all know, our country is about to go into its most important negotiations in decades, with consequences for generations to come, yet the three big issues – these issues divide within parties, not just across the House – of the single market, free movement and the customs union have still not been debated in this place.” Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: “Theresa May must stop trying to duck accountability by repeating empty platitudes. We need clear answers in her speech over the government’s plans, including whether it will stand up for Britain’s membership of the single market.” Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, called on May to use the speech to resolve the status of EU citizens already living in the UK, who fear they may lose their right to stay after Brexit. The government has said it would like the issue settled early in the negotiating process; but believes that must happen alongside reassurances for UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU. Labour is deeply divided over the issue of freedom of movement, with Jeremy Corbyn saying he does not object in principle to limits on immigration – but would be willing to accept the continuation of free movement as the price of continued membership of the single market.\\nHowever, others in the shadow cabinet accept that single market membership will not be possible, and are starting to re-think how an immigration regime might look outside the EU. In the House of Lords on Thursday, the Tory spokesperson, Lady Williams of Trafford, sparked fresh speculation about whether the government could tighten immigration rules within the existing freedom of movement regime – by insisting that EU migrants leave if they cannot find work after three months, for example. Pressed repeatedly on why the UK does not interpret the rules more strictly, as some member states do, she said: “It is not a failure to implement; it is a difference in each country’s implementation of its legislation. This country is more than generous in its implementation of that directive.” Following the debate, Lord (Richard) Rosser, Labour’s home office minister in the House of Lords, told the Guardian: “The government now appears to be saying that it hasn’t applied the rules on free movement as tightly as it could have, which suggests the argument that Brexit is the only way of reducing numbers coming to the UK from the EU is based on a false assertion. “But it also begs the question of what Mr Cameron and his then home secretary, Mrs May were up to before the referendum when seeking concessions from the EU on this issue.”', 'The pound has clocked up its biggest one-day gain against the dollar since 1998 as traders seized on Theresa May’s pledge that parliament would vote on any Brexit deal and welcomed some clarity on the government’s plans for leaving the EU. The FTSE 100 headed in the other direction, recording its biggest daily fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June. The share index has been boosted for several months by the fall in the pound, which helps exporters and those companies with overseas earnings, and some of that effect was unwound on Tuesday as the pound jumped almost 3%. The UK currency had been under pressure in the days before the prime minister’s key speech, as investors fretted over the prospect of the blow to trade and economic prosperity from a hard Brexit deal that leaves the country outside the European single market.\\nBut on the day of the speech the pound was buoyed early on by news of a rise in inflation. Some investors took that as a further sign that the next move in interest rates would be up, which in turn would strengthen the attraction of sterling. Once May took the podium, the pound rallied further against the dollar and the euro as she confirmed the likely deal to leave the EU would mean quitting the single market but that it would be put to a vote in both the upper and lower houses of parliament. “In laying out the government’s 12 guiding principles for the upcoming negotiations, Mrs May did remove some key question marks about the government’s approach and promised that both houses of parliament would get to vote on any Brexit agreement,” said Stephanie Flanders, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “This seems to have reassured investors.” The pound is still down about 17% against the dollar since the referendum and economists warned there was scope for it to fall further, given much uncertainty remained around the UK’s likely Brexit deal and the nature of negotiations with the rest of the EU. But on Tuesday it managed to recover some of its recent losses to reach a 10-day high of $1.2398, a rise of 2.9% on the day. It had dipped below $1.20 on Monday on hard Brexit worries. The FTSE closed down 1.5% at 7,220.38.\\nCommenting on the jump in the pound, Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex said: “As some expected, the pound had worked out most of its negative feelings about Theresa May’s Brexit intentions already, leading the currency to piggy-back on the less terrifying aspects of the prime minister’s announcement for some rather impressive gains. “It shows just how desperate the currency was for clarity that May’s speech, with its firm stance on leaving the single market and vague promises of free trade and some kind of new customs agreement, could inspire such a reaction from sterling despite most of what was said being pound-negative.” Sterling’s gains were also flattered by weakness in the dollar after Donald Trump said the US currency was overvalued. Trump said US companies could not compete with China “because our currency is too strong. And it’s killing us”, the Wall Street Journal reported. Richard Falkenhall, senior currency strategist at the Nordic bank SEB said the rally would prove to be temporary. “Despite the threats in today’s speech, the UK’s position in negotiations will be very weak once exit negotiations under the treaty starts. There is only a two-year period and the UK has the most to lose if negotiations fail. The two-year period will create a lot of uncertainty which is likely to harm the British economy and in particular the important British financial industry. “We view today’s pound rally as temporary and expect sterling to weaken again. We would not be surprised if comments from the EU as well as the UK sound very negative in the initial phases of the negotiations and during the exit process.” Andrew Goodwin, senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, also noted that the negotiations were far from guaranteed to succeed. “The prime minister did make a potentially important commitment to ask both houses of parliament to vote on the final deal, a promise which caused sterling to spike upwards,” he said. “But we do not see this as materially reducing the probability of the UK leaving the EU; it looks unlikely that ‘remaining’ will be one of the two options that parliament will be able to vote for.”', 'Britain risks a “disorderly crash landing” if it assumes it can safely walk away from troublesome Brexit talks, business leaders have said, in a last-ditch plea for a negotiated settlement with Europe. As Theresa May prepares to reveal an uncompromising set of UK objectives on Tuesday, pressure is mounting on the prime minister to take a firm line with other member states and ultimately fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs if no deal can be agreed.\\nBut the CBI is calling on politicians to wake up to the limitations of the WTO and dangers of a disorderly Brexit, despite the long and painful concessions that may be necessary if the UK is to obtain a replacement free-trade agreement when it leaves the single market. “The practicalities of a disorderly crash-landing need to be understood,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, in an interview with the Guardian. “We have had conversations with some of the proponents of just walking away and we will again talk to them about what we see from our members about the consequences of that. “An exit into WTO at the stroke of midnight without the proper planning and preparation in place would be very serious for the UK economy. There are some signs that there is more conversation around that being an outcome. Our job is to demonstrate how difficult that would be because of all of these unanswered questions.” While keen on a “implementation phase” with Europe, the CBI is also positive about prospects for a US trade deal. In the interview, carried out shortly before news of Donald Trump’s promise to do a deal with Britain, Fairbairn pointed out that the UK and US had a large reciprocal relationship with significant enough trade flows in either direction to ensure British interests were well reflected. The risk of a disorderly Brexit has risen in recent days as EU27 leaders have insisted that even a transitional arrangement – to allow a trade deal to be negotiated after the two-year divorce talks have concluded – would still require the UK to adhere to rulings from the European court of justice in the interim. May was widely reported on Sunday to be preparing to call for a “clean and hard” Brexit when she makes her speech at Lancaster House this week, even though the government also still favours a transitional phase to avoid the cliff edge feared by business. “We have been listening to what business is saying about the need for certainty wherever it can be brought,” wrote David Davis, the Brexit secretary, on Sunday. “That’s why, if it proves necessary, we have said we will consider time for implementation of new arrangements.”\\nBut many in the Tory party believe such ambitions must be abandoned if they come at too high a political cost, not least to demonstrate tactically that Britain goes into negotiations with the option of walking away. Michael Gove last week called for a “full Brexit, not fake Brexit” that would be completed “in months not years”. Even the relatively moderate chancellor, Philip Hammond, said this weekend in an interview with German press that the UK could aggressively compete with Europe on tax if it made a trade deal difficult, as ministers try to signal a harder-edged tone as the time for formal exit negotiations draws close. For British business, the hardening of political opinion on both sides of the Channel is alarming, not least as the EU negotiator Michel Barnier and the Bank of England governor Mark Carney have spoken about the dangers of financial instability without a deal. The CBI is calling on May to set open-trade with Europe as a priority when she makes her speech. “The idea of barrier-free access is an incredibly important principle for British business,” said Fairbairn. “Yes there may be a negotiation and yes, there may be trade-offs, but it is far too early for us to be saying in any way that these cease to be important and valid objectives for our economy.” Though the business lobby is trying to seek constructive ways forward on Brexit, it also remains concerned at the continued anti-immigration rhetoric coming from politicians. “We do have to be incredibly careful about the reputation of the UK around the world for openness and being a welcoming trading nation,” said Fairbairn. “There is no doubt that the world is watching. They are watching our every move.” She said things had improved since talk of a register of foreign workers made at Tory party conference and that business welcomed Downing Street distancing itself from new talk of a £1,000-per-worker immigration levy last week. “We are in a significantly better place, but we need to remain hugely alive to the interpretation that is going to be placed on what we might perceive as relatively small announcements,” said Fairbairn. The CBI is also calling for urgent clarity on the government’s objectives before members start making irreversible decisions on relocation. “The longer that we don’t have answers to key questions like ‘what’s the new immigration model going to be?’ and ‘what is the access to our main trading partner going to be like?’ business will be forced to make assumptions and that is why clarity matters so much,” said the director general. “The next three to six months will be vital for that.”', 'For the past six months Theresa May had been trying and failing to conjure some sort of credible Brexit plan and all she’d got for her efforts was a load of flak for being clueless. Eventually, she just got fed up. If she couldn’t come up with a deal she believed in, then she would come up with one she didn’t. She knew it would be economically disastrous for Britain to leave the single market, but if that’s what it took to get everyone who had voted to leave the EU off her back then so be it. Now to share her moment of enlightenment with the rest of the world. And where better than in one of the gilt-lined state rooms of Lancaster House that had doubled up as Buckingham Place for the Crown? As the room began to fill – cabinet ministers and EU ambassadors in the centre rows, hacks and No 10 apparatchiks to the side – a lone TV screen displayed the message “Plan for Britain”. And nothing else. It was a start, I suppose.\\nThe Maybot slid into the room almost unnoticed and took several deep breaths. She glanced down at her notes. There at the top in capitals was “TRY TO SOUND HUMAN. WE’VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE WITH SOME OF THESE PEOPLE LATER”. Easier said than done, but she’d do her best. She’d start by trying to soften everyone up. “It’s not you,” she said, looking directly at the ambassadors. “It’s us”. Britain had simply outgrown the EU and no longer wanted to be constrained by sleeping with only 27 partners. Britain wanted to go and shag the rest of the world. We had asked for an open marriage and the EU had said no, so a divorce was inevitable. But no one should panic. Britain wasn’t leaving Europe. Much as we’d like to if that was geographically possible. Understandably, being dumped live on global TV didn’t go down terribly well with the visiting ambassadors. There was a lot of head-shaking and whispering. The Maybot tried not to catch their eye and moved on to the part of her speech marked “Global Britain”. “The referendum was a vote for a new global Britain,” she insisted, hoping that no one would remember that many people who had voted to leave the EU wanted as little as possible to do with the rest of the world. Too full of foreigners stealing our jobs. “Global Britain, global Britain,” she repeated. If she said it often enough, someone might believe it. Even if she didn’t.\\nHaving got the pleasantries out the way, the Maybot moved on to her 12-point plan. She wasn’t entirely sure why there were so many points in the plan as most of them were just vague promises to clarify things that hadn’t yet happened, but her advisers had told her that cutting the plan down to just three points – 1. Get out the single market. 2. Get out the customs union. 3. To hell with the lot of you – wouldn’t play out that well. “Global Britain, global Britain,” the Maybot droned. If in doubt, return to the leitmotif. Britain wanted to be really, really global – Michael Gove had promised her that Donald Trump was dead keen on coming to a win-lose deal with the UK – but she was keen to extend the hand of friendship to the little old EU. So if the EU was prepared to give us everything we wanted in the negotiations, then we might just continue to trade and talk to it. But it was up to the EU to show willing. “It would not be the act of a friend to treat us punitively in the negotiations,” she said. Several ambassadors had to pinch themselves at this point; it hadn’t been the act of a friend to vote to leave. But the Maybot had one more sting in the tail. “No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain,” she added. Her way or no way. If the worst came to the worst, Britain could always settle for WTO rules and become a tax haven. “The country is coming together,” she concluded. One last white lie wouldn’t hurt. She knew it had never been so divided, and the divisions were only likely to get deeper now she had declared her hand for a hard Brexit that she hadn’t voted for and didn’t want. But people had demanded clarity and she’d given it to them. There was almost no applause at the conclusion of her speech but for once she didn’t care. Somehow she felt a little lighter. A weight was off her shoulders.', 'It was the speech that was supposed to make clear, once and for all, what “Brexit means Brexit” actually means. So what did we learn from Theresa May’s biggest speech yet as prime minister about the kind of deal she is seeking?\\nThe single market The prime minister does not want Britain to stay in the single market. This is no surprise: May has been repeating since the Conservative party conference in October that her top two Brexit priorities are controlling EU immigration and withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. Those two objectives are incompatible with membership of the single market and her comments on Tuesday merely confirm that she acknowledges that. “We will take back control of our laws and put an end to the jurisdiction of the European court in Britain,” May said in her speech. “I want to be clear that what I am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market.” Single market membership, she said, would mean accepting the EU’s four freedoms – free movement of goods, services, capital and people – and “complying with the EU’s rules and regulations that regulate those freedoms”. To all intents and purposes, she said, it would mean “not leaving the EU at all”. Instead of membership of the single market, Britain will seek “the greatest possible access to it through a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement”. That new trade agreement could, May said, include “elements of current single market arrangements in certain areas”, such as the freedom for the City of London to provide financial services across national borders, since it “makes no sense to start again from scratch”. The customs union The customs union is the EU’s common trading area: goods from outside the area are charged a common external tariff to cross its border and enter it; goods already within it can circulate and cross borders freely. A country that is part of the customs union cannot negotiate trade deals on its own – which is why many felt Britain was always destined to leave it, because negotiating independent trade deals is a big part of what pro-Brexit campaigners think Brexit should mean. Here the prime minister was less clear. “Full membership of the customs union prevents us from negotiating our own trade deals” outside the EU, she acknowledged – so she did not want Britain to be bound by the common commercial policy and the common external tariff. But she also said she wanted tariff-free trade with Europe and cross-border trade there to be “as frictionless as possible”, so she did want Britain to have a customs agreement with the EU. That could come in the form of a completely new customs agreement, or Britain could become an associate member of the customs union in some way, or retain some parts of it: “I have an open mind on how we do it,” May said. This seems to confirm the government will be looking for sector-by-sector deals for certain key businesses. Car parts, for example, cross EU borders dozens of times before completion, and customs checks would be disastrous for the automotive industry. Parliamentary involvement and article 50 timing May is apparently still determined to kick off two-year negotiations over Britain’s divorce from the EU by the end of March, although she made no reference to this in her speech on Tuesday. This deadline may be problematic if the supreme court rules, as expected, later this month that parliament must vote on the formal article 50 notification to the EU, and it could also be delayed by elections in Northern Ireland. Assuming the court does rule that parliament must have its say, there is still no clear indication of what exactly it will get to vote on, nor on the extent to which MPs will be able to reframe the terms of the government’s notification if they do not like it. May did, however, confirm for the first time that parliament – both the Commons and the Lords – would have their say on the final deal: “I can confirm today that the government will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force.” Controlling EU immigration May had repeatedly said control over Britain’s borders was a Brexit priority, and reiterated on Tuesday: while wanting to continue to attract “the brightest and best to study and work in Britain”, she said “we will get control over number of people coming to Britain from the EU”. Reminding her audience she was previously home office minister, May added: “You cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement from Europe ... Brexit must mean control of number of people coming to Britain from Europe.” However, the prime minister has yet to give any indication of the kind of immigration system she envisages for EU citizens after Brexit. She has previously rejected the idea of a point-based regime, and ministers have hinted at the possibility of work visas, but no new system has yet been formally announced. A transitional deal British business has insisted some kind of transitional arrangement with the EU will be essential to avoid the potential economic disaster of a “cliff-edge”: the UK leaving the bloc at the end of the two-year article 50 divorce talks, with no future relationship defined. May has spoken in the past of an “implementation period” – a set length of time allowing for the ground-rules of a previously agreed future relationship to be phased in. She repeated the term on Tuesday, saying it was “in no one’s interests to have a cliff-edge” so she wanted a phased process of implementation. But she is opposed to the kind of interim arrangement favoured by some who want a lengthy (or even open-ended) transitional deal in which EU rules would continue to apply while the future UK-EU relationship is hashed out in detail. An indefinite interim deal, May said, would be “permanent political purgatory” and she wanted “nothing that leaves us half-in, half-out”. Instead, she will seek to reach agreement on the future relationship within the two-year timeframe of the article 50 divorce talks. They would be followed by a flexible “phased process of implementation” that could vary in length according to the issue concerned – immigration controls, customs arrangements, financial services – and the complexity of the new arrangements needed. Status of EU citizens in UK and UK citizens on continent This could have been a chance for the prime minister – as campaigners have demanded – to make a unilateral guarantee that the rights of the 3 million EU citizens living the UK would be maintained after Brexit. For the time being, though, they look set to remain what the home secretary recently referred to as “negotiating capital”. May said on Tuesday that the government wants to guarantee their rights – and those of British citizens on the continent – “as early as we can”. She said she had told other EU leaders that “we could give people the certainty they want straight away, and reach such a deal now”, but that while many were in favour, a few were not (the EU-27 has refused any such talks under its rule of no negotiation before notification.) But she said she wanted “everyone to know that it remains an important priority for Britain – and for many other member states – to resolve this challenge as soon as possible”. The EU budget Ministers, including the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and officials have previously said some kind of payment into the EU’s budget might have to be part of whatever future trade deal the government negotiates with the EU. May did not say much on this question, but did make clear that “because we will no longer be members of the single market ... the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end.” There may, though, be “some specific European programmes in which we might want to participate. If so, and this will be for us to decide, it is reasonable that we should make an appropriate contribution.” The EEA option The European Economic Area (EEA) is an extension of the EU’s internal market, made up of the 28 member states and members of the European Free Trade Association (EftaFTA ), which includes Norway. Britain could become a member of the EEA after leaving the EU by joining Efta, giving it – like Norway – single market membership in exchange for a financial contribution and accepting the core principles of the EU’s internal market, including free movement of people. This always looked unlikely because of the importance the government has placed on controlling EU free movement. May confirmed that on Tuesday, saying: “We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries.” Her comment that Britain did not want “partial membership of the European Union, or associate membership of the European Union”, seemed to underline the point. Ireland and the union The prime minister again said she was committed to maintaining the pre-EU common travel area between Britain and Ireland and promised that the government would seek to avoid a “hard border” between Northern Ireland and the Republic. She also pledged to preserve the United Kingdom, describing the union between England, Scotland and Wales as precious. “It is only by coming together as one great union of nations and people that we can make the most of opportunities ahead,” she said. Tone The perceived anti-immigration tone of the Tory party conference shocked many on the continent, as has the insistence by some ministers since that the EU would wind up cutting Britain a special deal in defiance of all its single market principles. May paid lip service to the notion that if they are to be successful, negotiations with the EU will have to be conducted without animosity: “I want us to be ... the best friend and neighbour to our European partners,” she said. Referring repeatedly to “our friends and allies in the EU”, the prime minister added she had no interest in the bloc unravelling: “It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in Britain’s national interest that the EU should succeed.” But she warned that if the EU 27 heeded those “voices calling for a punitive deal that punishes Britain”, it would amount to “an act of calamitous self-harm for the countries of Europe. And it would not be the act of a friend.” She also stressed that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain”, and repeated chancellor Philip Hammond’s veiled threat that if it does not get the deal it wants, Britain could become a low-tax rival, saying the government was “free to change the basis of Britain’s economic model”. Conclusion We have a greater degree of clarity on what May’s Brexit objectives are, but they remain objectives. All is yet to be negotiated, and it is far from clear how much the EU 27 will be prepared to concede. So we know more about what “Brexit means Brexit” will not mean – but little, still, about what it will.', 'Matthew d’Ancona: This address had a Thatcheresque sting in its tail So the lady’s not for turning. Well, we knew that, didn’t we? Brexit means Brexit, no “partial membership”, no “half-in, half-out”. This was the section of Theresa May’s speech most heavily briefed in advance – but still gloriously welcome to the hard Brexiteers when she finally uttered the words like an ideological incantation. Though delivered as an encomium to the comity of nations, this address also had a Thatcheresque sting in its tail. The prime minister would not, she said, accept, a “punitive deal” with the EU. Indeed, the pursuit of such a strategy would be an act of “calamitous self-harm” by the remaining 27 member states. In such circumstances, they would lose access to crucial supply chains, to the City, and to the goodwill of Britain – which might, in retaliation, recast itself as an offshore tax haven. This was the prime minister as Don Corleone, warning the assembled diplomats of the continent that they were about to be made an offer they couldn’t refuse.\\nMay made her statement with poise, a sign of her under-acknowledged growth in the role of prime minister. But her precision-tooled rhetoric could not disguise the difficulty of what lies ahead. She wants both to leave – fully, unambiguously – and then to negotiate selective agreements with specific EU institutions: the “greatest possible access” to the single market, a new relationship with the customs union, cooperation over law and order, defence, intelligence. She ruled out paying “huge sums” to Brussels for the privilege – but not, please note, an “appropriate” contribution. As I wrote yesterday, Brexit is the easy bit. The prime minister must also steer the deal through parliament, which, quite rightly, will be given a vote on its content. In her negotiation with Brussels, she must prevent the “phased process of implementation” getting lost in “political purgatory”. That work alone will dominate her premiership. Today, she maintained the poker face that is her trademark. The other 27 players must now decide how to play their hands.\\nPolly Toynbee: This looks like war Call it clean, call it hard, but May’s red, white and blue Brexit threatens epic self-harm – out of the single market, out of the customs union, no half-in, half-out. Immigration she has put above all else, regardless of livelihoods and despite polls showing that Brexit voters would not want border control to cost them dearly. Enoch Powell from the grave has finally won – Brexiteer leaders are his direct inheritors. Where other Conservative leaders always saw off their little-Englander, closed-border right flank, she is the first to cave in. How she has sugared that hard truth in fantasy visions of her “stronger, fairer, more global Britain”, as if this “great global trading nation” with its gigantic trade deficit still ruled the imperial waves. Cake-and-eat-it delusions infused all she said: Irish border? We’ll sort it, God knows how. Get all the trade we want for every key sector – no problem, and no contributions either. They need us more than we need them, she boasts. If they try punishment, here’s her fist – a cut-throat tax haven race to the bottom, “our freedom to set a competitive tax rate”. How disgraceful too to use our intelligence capability as a deeply damaging added threat. More from the realms of fantasy: time and again she claimed the country was united or coming together, at least, when it has never been more sorely split, emotionally, politically, regionally, generationally. Nor was there any comfort for EU nationals here and thus none for UK nationals over there. Had she meant her words of keeping the partnership with old EU allies, that one small gesture of true friendship would have opened her negotiations in a genuine spirit of amity. Instead, this looks like war.\\nGiles Fraser: The left must not keep moping about the downsides I wonder if the symbolism was deliberate. For it was at Lancaster House that Margaret Thatcher delivered her “Europe open for business” speech in April 1988, extolling the virtues of the single market. Thatcher was one of the principal architects of this idea and her vision of Europe was that of a free trade zone where business could go on uninterrupted by the barriers of the nation state. Here, the free activity of business would not be interfered with by governments, whatever their elected mandate.\\nToday, May appeared at Lancaster House to rightly insist on our tradition of parliamentary sovereignty – which is why parliament will get the final say on the Brexit deal – but also to undo Thatcher’s disastrous single market model. The EU has become little more than a club for big business, which is why it’s over at the CBI and at Davos that they will be mourning Britain’s lack of membership the most. Yes, she made lots of warm and compensatory noises about free trade. But from now on we get to decide our trade rules in the House of Commons. Which is why, despite the obvious comparisons between them, May has become the first prime minister to escape from Thatcher’s dark shadow. The task for the left is not to resist any of this, still less to hope it will fail so that they can bask in an “I told you so” glow, but rather to redouble its efforts to repatriate the best bits of European law, such as workers’ rights and environmental protection, through the power of our own sovereign House of Commons. In other words, not to keep moping on about the downsides of leaving the EU, but to help shape our new relationship and win an election. Because the whole point of Brexit was to insist on our own right to determine our own future.\\nJohn Harris: Immigration is front and centre Twenty-nine years ago, the Berlin Wall was still intact, acid house was in full effect and Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister. In April 1988, she made a speech at Lancaster House that set out the glories of the European single market, seemingly the embodiment of her free-enterprise credo: “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible”, which would give UK businesses “direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people”. Well, goodbye to all that: it is one of the most remarkable turnarounds of recent history that we’re now on our way out, set only on “the greatest possible access”. The most vocal spokespeople for the 48% are understandably howling their pain. But in political terms at least, that move and the speech that announced it seemed straightforward and successful.\\nMay is no longer open to the charge that her government has no plan. By way of playing to the populist politics of the moment, immigration is front and centre. Even if MPs will be faced with a choice between a deal and no deal at all and thus vote in large numbers for what the government has negotiated, parliament will get the final say on Brexit’s terms. That faint sound you can hear is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, struggling to find a response that will have any traction at all. And yet, and yet. Within May’s speech was an attempt to tie together a huge array of political and economic items that may spectacularly fail. The idea that what 23 June represented was a vote for a Britain “even more global and internationalist, in action and spirit” is clearly laughable. It is no good banging on about a country open to overseas talent – and the glories of scientific and academic co-operation – when you are already moving towards cutting the numbers of EU students by over 30,000. Bromides about Scotland and Wales do not smooth over the fact that single market membership represents a huge red line for Nicola Sturgeon, and that the Union is once again creaking. One other thing. This was effectively May’s last big moment of political control before article 50 is triggered, negotiations begin, and all that stuff about the best deal in the best of all possible worlds collides with what the EU wants. When that story takes flight, today – and its temporary political dividends – will feel like something from another age.', 'Theresa May outlines her Brexit objectives in a speech at Lancaster House on Tuesday, in which she is expected to confirm that Britain will be leaving the EU’s single market.\\nThe previewed speech has been met with approval from pro-Brexit figures and newspapers, warnings from business leaders, and concern from leading Remain campaigners. We asked our readers to deliver an alternative to May’s anticipated speech. We heard, largely, from Remain voters, who felt that the government’s likely adoption of a “hard Brexit” is a betrayal of the 48% who voted to stay in the EU - not to mention the Conservative party’s own manifesto, which called for Britain to remain in the single market. Below, we outline eight increasingly unlikely alternative objectives, as suggested by our readers. 1) Keep Britain’s options open - and consult parliament\\nWe will explore all options including continuing membership of EEA/EFTA to seek a balance between immigration control and access to single market. The referendum result did not give detailed policy direction and this needs to be the subject of detailed parliamentary scrutiny and debate. Rob Jewitt, Northumberland 2) Stay in the single market\\nIn the referendum we did not vote to leave the single market, indeed Vote Leave promised we would not do so, as did the Tory manifesto in the 2015 election. We did not vote to leave the customs union. We did not vote to trade under WTO rules, or for a decade of compromised trade. We did not vote to reduce the value of our currency, to lose sterling’s reserve status, to lose our Triple A rating. We did not vote to be poorer. Anonymous, Wokingham 3) Secure the rights of EU citizens\\nBritain’s first priority should be about how this decision affects the lives of Eu citizens. British and other EU state citizens are all EU citizens with equal rights today. People from all over have moved to live in another EU state to live, work, marry and live their lives with wider horizons. Britain chooses to leave and therefore should immediately guarantee the rights of those from the EU who contribute to the UK economy Bob Eastham, Madrid 4) Announce a second referendum\\nWe need another referendum once the terms of our Brexit are decided, before article 50 is activated. If Brexit is the right path then a second referendum can only reinforce our resolve. If it is a mistake, then we need the opportunity to turn back having evaluated the facts and exposed the lies. Andy, Surrey 5) Acknowledge migration’s importance to the UK\\nWe now admit that we failed to address issues within our control - ensuring that all UK residents were accounted for, providing resources to address the needs of areas of high migration, and policing the minimum wage. But our analysis shows that nearly all migration is essential to the economy and also to ensuring adequate social care provision. John Hodgson, Nottingham 6) End the uncertainty\\nShe should give precise details of all the major changes which will occur when we leave the EU, as she should have done within a month of her appointment last year. Her indecision and secrecy has already caused much needless uncertainty for the country, and worry for EU citizens who work here. Richard Ekers, York 7) Delay the triggering of Article 50\\nOnly a narrow margin voted to leave, we must proceed cautiously and take the time to research exactly what people thought they were voting for and how their wishes can best be delivered. We must also acknowledge the concerns of those who voted to remain as well as legal residents who were not entitled to a vote but who will be profoundly affected by the change. The initial target date for invoking Article 50 does not, on further reflection, give us enough time to consider how we will restructure our economy and political system once we have left the EU. Amanda Wintcher, Gateshead 8) Call the whole thing off\\nThe least likely - and most popular - suggestion. It’s all been a horrible mistake and we are staying. Richard Delacour, Hove', 'What a happy day for the national newspaper Brexiteers. They reflect their joy in front page headlines and triumphant leading articles about Theresa May’s pledge to leave the single European market. “We will get clean break from EU” trumpets the Daily Express. “Theresa’s new FREE Britain”, is the Daily Mail’s front page headline. Now, says the Sun, for “Great Brexpectations”. And Metro weighs in with “May: we’ll go it alone with CLEAN Brexit.” The Daily Telegraph is more sober, “May: my 12-point plan for Brexit”, as is the Times “May sets out hard Brexit vision in bid to calm markets.” The non-Brexit press cannot avoid reporting the unwelcome news. “May rules out UK staying in the single market”, says the Guardian, “Britain’s clean break from EU”, says the i. And the Daily Mirror, which does not think the speech worthy of page 1 show, runs a spread headlined “May’s 12 Brexit battlegrounds”. The ode to joy sung by the Brexit-supporting papers is even more evident in the editorial columns. The Mail is delighted at the prime minister’s coming “clear and unequivocal” speech. “There will be no partial membership, no associate membership, or anything that leaves us ‘half in, half out’”. The Mail continues: “May’s bold, positive stance is a welcome relief from the relentless pessimism and scaremongering of her opponents... “She offers an inspiring vision of the sort of country we can become when unshackled from the sclerotic Brussels machine that has held us back for so long: a Britain that is freer, more outward-looking, more prosperous and stronger than ever before.” The Sun is pleased too: “The omens are all good. She knows we must leave the single market to take back control of our immigration policy and our laws.” The Express is particuarly pleased about the likelihood of “removing ourselves from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice to prevent foreign judges from overruling our own supreme court.” Now, its says, with May “having set out her stall, it is up to the leaders of the rest of the EU to decide if they are willing to work towards a mutually beneficial free trade deal”. The Telegraph thinks May’s speech today “may turn out to be every bit as momentous as that of her predecessor four years ago.” And it spends some time pouring scorn on David Cameron before praising the current prime minister’s stance. “The British position is a strong one,” sasy the paper, “and if the EU is unwilling to recognise how its interests can be served with a mutually beneficial deal on trade in goods and services, then the UK can go it alone and succeed. The economic backdrop to the Prime Minister’s speech remains auspicious”. The Times’s Rachel Sylvester is altogether more sceptical about May’s grasp of the situation: “Her problem remains that she thinks of Brexit as a still photograph when it is really a moving picture. “With her meaningless slogans and her insistence on prioritising immigration controls, the prime minister is behaving as if the world around her is static. In fact it is an action drama, with a fast-moving plot”. She argues that “ministers seem to assume that nobody else has a role to play in the negotiations. Yet, as the slump in the value of sterling shows, this may be an island but Britain cannot act alone”. As for immigration, Sylvester believes May The “is striking a pose” in order “to demonstrate her commitment to Brexit, and sometimes overcompensates”. Boris Johnson, she suggests, would have acted differently and, by implication, more sympathetically. In the Guardian, Lord Mandelson argues that in Britain loses free access to its main export market in Europe, “our economy will become smaller and poorer”. Although May will claim that this can be mitigated by special new trade arrangements between Britain and the EU, he writes: “I can testify that so-called free trade agreements never come for free, they never cover all trade, and they are a devil’s own job to agree”. He believes “the prime minister’s reading of the referendum is that the only thing the public cares about is immigration, and that immigration should now run economic policy even if it means the country becoming poorer as a result”. The Mirror contends that May “remains clueless about where she wants to take Britain and how we’ll get to the destination. “Broad strokes are fine but this country’s prosperity, our jobs and our living standards, depend on trade deals and, yes, migration agreements, with 27 nations who are unhappy that we’re bailing out of the European Union”. But it does think her approach to negotiations “with a velvet glove draped on the iron fist... is sensible, adding: “The PM is wise to ignore ideological headbangers who believe abusing neighbours is the key to living in harmony”.', 'Amid death threats and intensifying political disagreement, three of the most senior judges in England and Wales will hear claims that the government cannot trigger Brexit without parliamentary approval.\\nScores of QCs and lawyers will cram into court four on Thursday, the largest in London’s Royal Courts of Justice, to hear two and a half days of argument that could decide how – or conceivably even whether – the UK leaves the EU. The legal dispute is over who has authority to notify Brussels formally that Britain is withdrawing under article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU) – parliament or ministers. Article 50 states that any member state may leave “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements”, an undefined term that has allowed both sides to pursue rival interpretations. The case could open deep rifts in the consensus over the UK’s unwritten constitution. If the judges concluded that MPs should decide, the majority might not be in favour of leaving. The government maintains that the decision to depart has been taken by the referendum on 23 June and that its executive powers, under the royal prerogative, are sufficient for David Davis, the Brexit secretary, to give notice on behalf of the cabinet. The attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, who will lead the government team, also asserts that initiating withdrawal does not change any UK laws and that the consequences will be subject to future negotiation and parliamentary scrutiny. The government’s lawyers also argue that the courts are “ill-suited” to decide on the matter.\\nBut the teams of lawyers deployed by the claimants, interested parties and interveners, some of whom are crowd-funded, counter that the referendum was merely consultative and that a decision to leave has not yet been taken. Parliament alone, they argue, has the power to decide. Davis, one skeleton argument explains, “may only notify such a decision to the European council under article 50 (2) TEU once he has been properly authorised to do so by an act of parliament”. The submission also quotes approvingly from the Bill of Rights 1689, a piece of legislation revered by Eurosceptics, that it “expressly prohibits the use of the prerogative in circumstances where its exercise would ‘suspend’ or ‘dispense’ statutory law”. Subsequent legislation has further restricted the extent of the royal prerogative. The two main claimants leading the judicial review challenge are Gina Miller, a businesswoman and philanthropist, and Deir dos Santos, a hairdresser. Both are British nationals. Miller said the challenge was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We are all leavers now.” The case, she said, was intended to “answer a fundamental legal question about the powers that can be used by the prime minister and whether they can side-step parliament”. The People’s Challenge, one of the interested parties representing individuals who live in England, France, Gibraltar, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, has to date raised more than £150,000 from more than 4,000 supporters to finance the case. There have been demonstrations outside the London office of the Mishcon de Reya law firm by opponents holding placards declaring: “Invoke article 50 now” and “Uphold the Brexit vote”.\\nAnneli Howard, a barrister at Monckton Chambers working with Mishcon de Reya, said this week that “a number of death threats” and a large amount of online abuse had been directed against those leading the legal challenge. At a preliminary hearing, Sir Brian Leveson ordered that the identities of some of the claimants should be withheld to protect them. “Apart from the commission of a criminal offence, there’s a real risk that behaviour of this type is a contempt of court,” he said. The high court hearing in London is before the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the newly appointed master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales.\\nThe claimants will make their case on Thursday. The government is due to respond next Monday and further argument may go on into Tuesday. Judgment is expected to be reserved. A similar claim has been heard in Northern Ireland, stressing additionally the complexities of devolution legislation, which, it is alleged, would prevent withdrawal from the EU without further consultation. That judgment has also been reserved. Whoever loses each case is expected to appeal directly to the UK’s supreme court in London in December. Because of the short period available before March, when Theresa May says she will trigger Brexit, provision has been made for the claims to leapfrog the court of appeal and go directly to the supreme court. The most tangled outcome would be for the judges to refer the matter to the European Union’s court of justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg seeking clarification on what is meant by “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements”. None of the parties is urging that outcome, which would in effect hand over to European judges fundamental questions about British sovereignty.\\nIn a parliamentary debate on Wednesday over MPs’ scrutiny of Brexit, Dominic Grieve QC, the Conservative former attorney general, pointed out there was a convention that major treaty changes had to be put to the House of Commons for an affirmative vote. Although that was only a convention, he said, conventions must be followed. The notion that governments resign after losing a vote of confidence may only be a convention, he added, but MPs would be very surprised if that were ignored. Before the hearing, Wright, said: “The country voted to leave the European Union in a referendum approved by act of parliament. There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door, and no second referendum. We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.” Dominic Raab, the Conservative MP and prominent leave campaigner, called the challenge “a rather naked attempt to steal the referendum by the back door”. “I don’t think that it’s right that a fund manager with deep pockets and friends in high legal places gets to go to court and try to frustrate that decision,” he told the BBC. “The vast majority of people in this country, leave or remain, would think it was outrageous that a small group of people could go to court to overturn a decision made by 33 million people.” The main claimants, interested parties and interveners are: Gina Miller, a UK investment manager. She is represented by the law firm Mischcon de Reya, Lord Pannick QC and Rhodri Thompson QC. Deir Dos Santos, a hairdresser who holds UK and European citizenship, is represented by the law firm Edwin Coe, Dominic Chambers QC and Jessica Simor QC. The People’s Challenge, a crowdfunded initiative, represented by the law firm Bindmans, Helen Mountfield QC and Gerry Facenna QC. AB and a child represented by the law firm Bhatia Best and Manjit Gill QC. Fair Deal for Expats, a group formed of British expatriates living abroad in 10 EU states, represented by the law firm Crofts Solicitors and Patrick Green QC. The defendant resisting the actions is the secretary of state for exiting the EU, David Davis, who is represented by the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, James Eadie QC and Jason Coppel QC. • This article was amended on 13 October 2016 to remove part of an indirect quote as the information in it was found to be incorrect.', 'The government has been accused of trying to avoid scrutiny of its Brexit strategy by creating a parliamentary committee that is too big to do its job properly. Under a plan to be unveiled on Wednesday, 21 MPs from every party in the House of Commons except Ukip and the Greens, will sit on the new Brexit select committee. The committee will be almost double the size of almost every other Commons select committee after a deal struck between Conservative and Labour whips. But some senior MPs have claimed that the committee has been made deliberately large so that it is less effective at scrutinising the government’s strategy and less able to reach a consensus. Their view has been echoed by the Whitehall thinktank the Institute for Government (IFG) that warned it could be a “recipe for the lowest common denominator”. “The more MPs you have on a committee the harder it is to get a persistent and effective form of question and the harder it is to reach a consensus in your conclusions,” said Hannah White, the IFG’s director of research. “On such a contentious issue as Brexit there is a real risk that such a committee just become a recipe for the lowest common denominator.” A senior Conservative MP added: “It’s ridiculously large. It won’t be able to agree anything and you can’t help but feel it’s a bit of a conspiracy by our whips to make sure the government get on with it all without scrutiny or criticism.” Elections among MPs for membership of the new committee are due to take place next week. It will be chaired by a Labour MP with the pro-remain former shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, seen as the front runner.\\nHowever he is expected to be challenged by the leave supporter Kate Hoey. If she secures enough nominations she could defeat Benn if the government and Brexit-supporting Tories decide to throw their weight behind her candidacy. Other MPs thought likely to seek positions on the committee include the former Brexit-supporting ministers Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith. From the remain side, the former business minister Anna Soubry and former shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds are also thought to be intending to put their names forward. Soubry said the committee did seem “very big” but added: “If Hilary Benn chairs it he will no doubt make sure it works effectively.” Most Commons select committees that scrutinise the work of government departments have no more than 11 members. The exceptions are the public accounts committee, which has 15, and the liaison committee – which is made up of the chairs of all 31 of the select committees and regularly questions the prime minister. That committee has faced accusations from MPs that it is “toothless” due to its size and “skims over” subjects to fit in more questions. Under its current chair, Andrew Tyrie, efforts have been made to limit the range of questions at each session to make it more effective. The Brexit committee will have a wide remit to scrutinise the government’s strategy for exiting the European Union and the work of David Davis’s new department. Ten members will be Conservative, five Labour, two SNP and one seat each for the Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party and Plaid Cymru. Elections for the committee chair and membership are due to take place next week. There will also be a new select committee shadowing the work of the new department for international trade. It will be chaired by the SNP MP Angus McNeil.', 'Theresa May was confused. She didn’t appear to have heard her home secretary telling the Conservative party conference that foreign workers would be named and shamed. “That never happened,” she insisted at prime minister’s questions, “which is why I went out of my way earlier in the week to say that when Amber Rudd had said this she actually meant the complete opposite.” Doublethink used to be a prerogative of the left.\\nThe prime minister was also confused about whether parliament should be allowed to debate the terms on which Britain would negotiate its exit from the EU. “When I said the government wasn’t prepared to debate Brexit,” she again insisted, “what I really meant was that it hadn’t occurred to me parliament would be interested in why the value of the pound was falling further and further by the day.” Most of all, though, Theresa was confused by the Labour party. For months now she had been used to it being a bit of a rabble and squabbling among itself. Now it was showing signs of getting its act together. Jeremy Corbyn was asking trickier and more focused questions and the backbenchers were more interested in getting under Tory skins than their leader’s. No one had ever warned her that the opposition might actually oppose and she couldn’t handle it. She felt brittle and unsure; even she wasn’t convinced by her answers. Grumpy David Davis was also confused. And even grumpier than usual. He’d been told the government wouldn’t be giving a running commentary on its Brexit negotiations and here he was being dragged back to the Commons for the second time in three days to explain why he didn’t really have a clue about what he was supposed to be doing and was making it up as he went along. He hadn’t voted for Britain to leave the EU only for parliament to hold him to account. That’s not what he called “taking back control”. Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, tried to make things easy for Grumpy. Scrutinising the government’s Brexit negotiations was not about trying to renege on the result of the referendum; it was about trying to negotiate the best possible outcome for leaving the EU. Hadn’t Grumpy tabled a 10 minute rule bill back in 1999 which questioned the right of the executive to ratify treaty changes without a vote in parliament? “La la la,” grumped Grumpy. “I’m not listening.” “Allow me to put it this way, then,” Starmer continued, helpfully. If Grumpy was going to act like an idiot, he would treat him like one. “The referendum was a mandate to leave the EU. It wasn’t a mandate on the terms on which we would leave. You can’t build a consensus around a position that you’ve refused to disclose.” “Another day, another outing,” said Grumpy when he finally got to have his say. “My mandate is my mandate. It is the biggest mandate ever. Take back control. I am not a robot. Clunk. Clunk. Whirr.” Grumpy didn’t bother to check his notes. He was still on auto-pilot from last Monday. “There’s no need for the government to do anything it doesn’t want to. We’ve done quite enough voting. My mandate is my mandate. Control back take. Clunk. Whirr. Plop.” “Actually,” Labour’s Jack Dromey interrupted. “A junior minister, George Eustice, has just gone on the radio to say that the government will be putting forward a green paper for parliament to debate. So that rather suggests we will get a vote.” “Mandate. Back control take. There will be no vote. Ever. Over my rapidly dying body. Clunk. Clunk. Whirr.” Grumpy’s system was suffering severe overload from a government making up policy on the hoof behind his back. Grumpy made his excuses and made a quick dash for the exit. The reason for Grumpy’s systems failure soon became even clearer. It wasn’t just the opposition that was learning how to oppose. It was also the Tory backbenchers who were beginning to find their voice. “My duty to represent my constituents transcends that of my duty to the party,” said Dominic Grieve. The sentiment was echoed by Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Claire Perry, Chris Philp, Ken Clarke, Maria Miller and Alastair Burt. Back at No 10, Theresa May could see her majority slipping away in front of her eyes. There must be no vote prior to article 50 being triggered after all. She picked up the phone and told Eustice that when he had talked about putting a Brexit green paper before parliament he’d really been talking about a completely different green paper. Eustice scratched his head. The prime minister’s confusion was contagious.', 'After his meetings with Theresa May, I gather, Barack Obama has expressed true astonishment to his aides over Brexit. “They’ve got no plan,” he has said. “They’ve just got no plan.” In the prime minister’s first six months, this private assessment has hardened into something close to a general orthodoxy: namely that May and her colleagues have established no clear strategy for Britain’s departure from the European Union. But what if the soon-to-be-ex-president is wrong? To adapt Sherlock Holmes: we see but we do not observe. This prime minister is not a great exponent of euphemism, metaphor and rhetorical trope. Instinctively, she says what she means. The natural response of a political and media class raised on spin, dog-whistles and devious code is to look for hidden meaning or the absence of any meaning\\xa0at all. When May says that “Brexit means Brexit”, it feels like a dereliction of cryptographic duty to take her at face value. Yet her method is, and has always been, to disclose her intentions straightforwardly but according to her own timetable. As she reportedly says to allies: “I don’t care if people think I’m stupid for\\xa0a bit.” On Tuesday at Lancaster House she will deliver her long-awaited statement on the government’s plans – potentially the most significant speech on the EU by a prime minister since David Cameron unveiled his referendum blueprint in January 2013. In so doing, she will relax her own rule that there shall be “no running commentary” on Britain’s negotiating strategy. But this statement was the price exacted by the Commons in December for MPs’ commitment to “respect the wishes of the people” and trigger article 50 before the end of March – a price worth paying for such an\\xa0undertaking. Every word, every phrase, every inflexion will be analysed within an inch of its life. How could it be otherwise? The burden of expectation borne by this speech is crushing. It reflects months of work by the PM, her closest aides and cabinet colleagues, advised by senior officials such as Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, and Oliver Robbins, the permanent secretary for the Department for Exiting the European Union.\\nYet, whatever the prime minister says, it is intrinsic to the exercise that she will disappoint as well as please. In too many minds, “Brexit” has ceased to be an institutional process and become a telos: a destination, even a utopian outcome, in which a newly emancipated Britain will hurtle towards unspecified\\xa0glories. The hardcore of the speech will be a readiness for straight withdrawal from the EU: from the single market, the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, the common security and defence policy, the common agricultural policy, the works. No half measures. Out means out. Is this “hard Brexit”? Only if you see the choice between hard and soft varieties as a one-off decision, a fork in the road, a light switch. In practice, they are better understood as sequential phases rather than adversarial options. First we leave; then we rebuild a multilayered relationship with the EU based on, but not confined to, the deal reached by March 2019. That, at least, is the theory. Though muscular Brexiteers will be delighted by May’s commitment to a clean break with the EU, they will be less pleased by her remarks on the need to give and take as we negotiate a completely new pact with the remaining 27 member states. As May herself said last April: “The reality is that we do not know on what terms we would win access to the single market. We do know that in a negotiation we would need to make concessions in order to access it.” That we are leaving is not in dispute. That our new alliance with the EU will bear a cost is the next big argument. Those who know May well suggest that a precedent is under our very noses. As home secretary she opted out of 130 EU crime and policing measures – before opting back in to 35, including the European arrest warrant. This, broadly, is the model she will try to follow. Indeed, the work has already begun. In Whitehall, detailed analysis of more than 50 industrial sectors is under way to inform future commercial and migration strategy. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has already floated the idea of continued contributions to Brussels in return for targeted access to particular\\xa0markets.\\nThe government is quietly committed to Britain’s post-Brexit participation in EU patent protection. Having laboured so hard to ensure we signed up to the arrest warrant, it is difficult to imagine May not seeking a successor deal. The question is whether the 27 will buy any of this. As the Guardian disclosed at the weekend, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is seeking a “special” relationship with the City of London after Britain’s departure – one that will protect the access of the remaining member states to Britain’s financial services. Since Europe is our largest market for such services, this is no small breakthrough.\\nThat said, there remains a deeply ingrained resistance on the continent to any deal that encourages the notion of an EU a la carte. Last month Angela Merkel told her party congress that “we will not allow any cherry-picking”. As one senior British ex-minister puts it: “Nobody in Europe sees this as an opportunity. It is something they have to manage and handle. But it’s a big mistake to imagine that they see this as an exciting chance for everyone to benefit.” We shall soon discover whether Britain’s position as the EU’s largest export partner – accounting for 16% of its traded goods – is sufficient leverage to secure an advantageous deal. Remember that the Canada-EU trade negotiations almost failed because Wallonia’s regional parliament took against them. All this lies ahead of the prime minster. Her immediate challenge is to calm the political seas around her, and to introduce a measure of realism to a national debate still shrill with anticipation and dread. She will make demands of ardent leavers as well as disappointed\\xa0remainers. Amid the cacophony, she will seek to assert her authority. For authority is what she will need most of all as she undertakes the toughest international negotiations to face a prime minister in recent memory. Unlikely as it sounds, Brexit is the easy bit.', '“I’m still hoping. I can’t really believe it’s going to happen, but in the back of my mind it’s always there. I love this country; I want to live here. I always dreamed of coming, because it was such an open-minded, lovely place where foreigners were greeted. I think that’s part of why I was so shellshocked on 24 June: because this country I thought I knew suddenly turned up a very ugly face.” Chris Hoffman is a 44-year-old freelance translator who lives in south Birmingham. She is originally from Stuttgart and first came to the UK thanks to the European Union’s Erasmus student exchange programme. Later on, her husband started academic research in Birmingham, which then turned into a full-time job – and a little more than a decade ago, they settled in the city. They have an eight-year-old son. “He might not have a British passport,” she tells me, “but he was born here, and he feels British.” Now, the prospect of Britain leaving the EU seems to have infected her life with anxiety. Does she think she might have to go back to Germany? “We’ll have to, if they chuck us out,” she says. “We haven’t got EU residency cards; we haven’t gone for naturalisation.” Why not do that? “If the government starts throwing out EU citizens, I don’t want to live in this country any more,” she says. On the first working day after the Christmas break, Hoffman has arranged to meet me in a cafe in the Kings Heath area of the city, along with two people who are campaigning alongside her against Brexit: 55-year-old Margaret Murray, who came to Birmingham 30 years ago from Ireland; and George Turvey, a native of south Wales who was, until recently, employed at Birmingham City University, but is now devoting his working time – on an unpaid basis – to trying to keep Britain in the EU. The three of them are among the 15 people behind EU in Brum, an amazingly active set-up that was founded in the days after last year’s referendum. None of them did any formal campaigning prior to the vote; they fully expected the leave campaign to amount to nothing more threatening than a sizeable protest vote, and for remain to convincingly win. Late last year, EU in Brum was also the host for a “national grassroots remain strategy meeting”, organised by the new national pressure group Britain for Europe, and intended to coordinate the work of a whole host of campaigns.\\n“There were about 40 organisations there,” says Turvey. “More dialled in on Skype. We had somebody from Gibraltar. There are a lot of expat organisations – people who travel from France and Germany to the meetings. It’s about collaboration, how we can work together, and grow the movement. We’re all linked now, and there’s work going on all the time.” And what is their main objective? “Remaining in the EU,” he says. “Of course.” Some former remain campaigners, I remind him, are now seemingly resigned to Britain leaving the EU, and set on pushing for what political cliche calls a soft Brexit. How does he feel about that? “We’re unequivocal; 100%,” he says. “We’re not going to compromise.” The Conservatives are combining a rush towards the European exit door with the sense that they have no real negotiation plan. As of Tuesday, when great howls of dismay went up from left-leaning remainers, Labour’s position combines Jeremy Corbyn’s claim that “the UK can be better off out of the EU” with a possible watering-down of the leadership’s support for the principle of free movement, suffused with the increasingly familiar sense of a party that is all at sea. So, while the SNP remains staunchly pro-European, it’s not surprising that, in England and Wales, people who passionately want Britain to stay in the EU feel they are not represented (apart from by the Lib Dems and Greens, perhaps – but with 10 MPs between them, that might amount to rather cold comfort). In response to this growing political gap, initiatives aimed at fighting Brexit and somehow overturning the referendum result have been springing up in huge numbers. Besides EU In Brum, there are plenty of groups rooted in specific places: Aberdeen for Europe, Hants4EU, The Berkshire 48%, Glostays, Wessex for Europe, and many more. Online, you can choose from such national networks as Britain for Europe, Sixteen Million Rising, Vote for Europe and Want2Stay.\\nA somewhat secretive set-up called EU Flag Mafia – whose people do not answer my enquiries on Twitter – has been founded with the aim of making sure the EU stars are seen as often as possible: back in September, they distributed around 2,500 EU flags at the Last Night of the Proms. March for Europe organised two anti-Brexit demonstrations in London last year, and another one, overseen by a network called I’m Still In, is planned for 25 March. On 20 February, people will be involved in One Day Without Us, an attempt to highlight the contribution immigrants make to Britain via special events – or by simply not turning up for work – that will have a big anti-Brexit dimension. As much as anything, this burgeoning resistance highlights what an insanely divided country the UK has become. Post-referendum conversations with convinced leave voters usually include unshakable views that have now hardened into cliche – chiefly, the idea that even now, we are only a few establishment manoeuvrings away from some great stitch-up that will overturn the result. And guess what? In the eyes of people who want out of Europe as soon as possible, that might be exactly what the anti-Brexit activists are aiming at. The latter, of course, say that a minority of the overall electorate voted to leave and that there is hardly the thumping mandate for leaving Europe some politicians talk about – and that, besides all that, Brexit will be such an economic and social disaster that it has to be avoided. Whatever, were you to put both camps together, there would be precious little common ground – which is perhaps why a lot of people talk about what George Turvey says is now very common – “the breaking-up of friendships, even rifts within families.”\\nFor the people involved in the anti-Brexit movement, it is currently pretty much impossible keeping up with who is doing what, but what is happening is a prime example of how 21st-century politics increasingly works. The lumbering structures of parties and traditional top-down pressure groups are ill-suited to such a spontaneous upsurge. In any case, the fact that mainstream politics is barely representing anti-Brexit views has encouraged people to simply do something themselves, only to find that thousands of others feel the same way. The day before my trip to Birmingham, I take a train to Manchester to find out more about one of the most vocal national anti-Brexit organisations – 48 And Beyond, which is a hyperactive force on Facebook, and is set on encouraging the formation of yet more local anti-Brexit groups. Its founder is 32-year-old Eoin Ward, originally from Omagh in Northern Ireland, who is studying for a masters while also teaching English as a foreign language to, among other people, students from EU countries whom he says are now facing a very uncertain future. We meet in a city-centre Pret a Manger, where he explains both his own staunch belief in the EU (partly down to where he’s from: “People in Northern Ireland see the EU in action every day,” he says), and the six-month story of what he started the day after the referendum. At that point, he says, he had done “a bit of leafleting” with the official remain campaign, and was expecting a narrow win for his side – but when the unthinkable happened, he very quickly resolved to take action. On 24 June, he recalls, a group of English friends of Irish descent paid him a visit: “They had just been to the Irish Centre in Manchester to get their Irish passport forms; they were getting in there early. We sat and sympathised for a while, and then we said: ‘We really need to do something.’ So I started a Facebook group called The 48%. I invited about 30 Facebook friends to join. That was on the Friday afternoon. By Sunday evening, we had 20,000 people.” The group is now closed (in the sense that permission has to be given for people to join), and has more than 50,000 members; its Facebook community page has 30,000. There’s a steering committee of four people which does a video conference every Tuesday and meets up “every now and again” – but Ward says the group’s priority now is to manifest itself in the offline world. “We’re trying to get people off Facebook and out into their local area,” he says. “That’s a big push. Reading for Europe was the first; he says that Manchester for Europe is now close to hitting 200 members. So how many local offshoots does he think 48 And Beyond have spawned? “At least 50,” he says.\\nCampaigning, of course, comes with risks. In August, Ward was involved in organising a pro-EU demonstration in central Manchester. “At least 20 quite scary-looking people turned up with bandanas over their faces, holding up St George’s flags and filming everything. I don’t know what group they were from but, to me, they looked a bit kind of neo-Nazi, white supremacist – that sort of ilk. They were giving us a lot of grief, telling us we didn’t respect democracy.” What about online? “We sometimes get leave voters infiltrating the group, writing quite provocative things. But it’s water off a duck’s back. It’s much scarier in real life.” What is his basic aim? “What we want, first of all, is for Theresa May to acknowledge that there are 16 million people who voted remain, and represent those people to some degree. So far, she has ignored almost half the country. At the moment, we don’t feel represented, and I think that’s why there are so many groups.” Is he trying to overturn Brexit? “Initially, I did say: ‘We will try to stop Brexit.’ I personally think we’ve gone too far down the line now. I’m not saying that’s the view of all the people in my group, but it seems like we’re on that path, with the deadline for article 50. And I’ve always been for the best possible deal for the people who voted remain. That means no change to employment protection, environmental protection, or free movement – all of those things we like about the EU. We don’t want those to change. Being a member of the single market? No question.” And can he and the group make a difference? “Definitely. What’s the alternative? Just sitting back and accepting everything? We’ve got to at least try.” EU in Brum had its first meeting about two weeks after the referendum, in the upstairs room of a cafe, where around 40 people showed up. At first, their conversation was more a kind of collective therapy than political action. “People were traumatised,” says Margaret Murray. “I think they wanted that space to meet other people who felt damaged, whereas within their own families or at work or wherever, they couldn’t express those things. Some of them felt like, ‘I don’t know the people around me any more.’” Now, though, EU in Brum is all about being visible, and loudly making the case for Europe. It holds fortnightly public meetings, does regular street stalls, and makes a point of showing up at any number of local events, from last summer’s Labour leadership hustings, to gatherings of local businesspeople. In September, it held its first march in the city centre, which attracted around 500 people, who were guided around a route taking in buildings that would have been inconceivable without EU funding. Not long after that, the group arranged another rally outside last year’s Conservative party conference, at the city’s Symphony Hall – ironically enough, the centrepiece of a development that was assisted by £50m funding from Brussels. Three months on, the group still think that Brexit can somehow be overturned. “I think we still have every chance of achieving that,” says Hoffman. “It’s probably not going to be easy, but I don’t think it’s set in stone that we have to leave.” “Theresa May could just turn it around,” says Turvey, who emphasises the constitutional fact – perhaps offset by the politics of Brexit – that the vote was advisory. “There’s no reason why she has to pursue this headlong crusade to ruin the UK.” “There are many ways it could happen,” says Hoffman. “If you have a second referendum, or a general election … More and more, remainers are in the news, and people realise that this is still an ongoing topic. People are saying: ‘Maybe I voted leave, but I’ve had a rethink.’ I have met several leavers who now regret voting that way.”\\nWhat about the idea that a lot of people and places that voted leave did so after years of feeling completely marginalised – and that, if they were ignored again, their resentment would turn nuclear? “That is one of the major issues: this sense of alienation and isolation in society,” says Turvey. “If people wanted to take advice from this advisory referendum, there’s a key piece of information. But the government is doing nothing to address it. That’s what they should be doing.” There is one last devil’s advocate point. When leavers talk about the EU’s democratic shortcomings, or its embrace of the economics of austerity, they have a point, don’t they? Is it really an institution worth defending with this much passion? “We pay less than 0.5% of our GDP to the EU,” says Turvey. “Think of all the incredible benefits: some research came out saying that we maybe get 5 or 6% of our GDP back, from the fact that we’re a member. If you weigh that against the fact that there needs to be reform, and we could make it better … the UK was a leader in the EU, and it should still be at the heart of it, making sure it is strong and fit for purpose and the best it can be. And the other thing is, what’s the alternative? It’s just a no-brainer.” Which brings us to perhaps the most interesting question of all. Can the resistance movement not merely sustain itself, but actually grow? “It’s getting bigger all the time,” says Hoffman. “It is,” agrees Turvey. “And, really, it’s only a matter of time. There’s never been a good-news story for Brexit, has there? It’s all negative. If you look at the prospects for the UK, it’s disastrous.” He has been remarkably upbeat for the past hour and a half, but suddenly he almost seems to light up. “Surely, soon enough, people will have to realise that.”', 'The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has suggested Britain could transform its economic model into that of a corporate tax haven if the EU fails to provide it with an agreement on market access after Brexit. In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, Hammond said that if Britain were closed off from European markets after leaving the EU, it would consider abandoning a European-style social model with European-style taxation and regulation systems, and “become something different”.\\nThe chancellor made his remarks in response to the suggestion that “the impression on the European continent is that your government sees the future business model of the UK as being the tax haven of Europe”. Hammond responded that “most of us who had voted remain would like the UK to remain a recognisably European-style economy with European-style taxation systems, European-style regulation systems etc. I personally hope we will be able to remain in the mainstream of European economic and social thinking. But if we are forced to be something different, then we will have to become something different”. Asked to clarify his remarks, Hammond said: “We could be forced to change our economic model, and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness. And you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do. “The British people are not going to lie down and say ‘too bad, we’ve been wounded’. We will change our model and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged.” Hammond’s rhetoric seemed to be at odds with the message he tried to convey to his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schäuble, during a trip to Berlin last week, namely that the UK had no desire to disrupt the EU during its divorce from the bloc. In his interview with Welt am Sonntag, Hammond also emphasised that restricting immigration would be the British government’s priority during negotiations. “We are aware that the message from the referendum is that we must control our immigration policy,” he said. Unlike in previous interviews, the chancellor would not be drawn on a guarantee that highly skilled workers from the EU would still be allowed to settle and work in the UK. “Assuming you hold a German passport, you can travel to the UK to do business and to travel, of course,” he said. “The question is about the freedom to travel for work, the freedom to settle and the freedom to establish a business.” Reports suggest the prime minister, Theresa May, is looking into restricting access for EU workers for “every sector and every skill level”. The chancellor, however, rejected his interviewers’ suggestion that the UK and the US, traditionally the leading champions of capitalism and free trade, were “turning their back to the world”.\\n“I would reject that emphatically,” Hammond said. “I can’t speak for what is going on in the US, that is a different political movement. But in my judgment, it would be a mistake to read the Brexit vote as being part of the same strand of thinking that has formed in the US. “If you look at the media and the reporting during the Brexit referendum campaign, there was no anti-trade rhetoric. It was the exact opposite.” Hammond said he was hopeful that the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU and its new status could be discussed in parallel once the government had triggered article 50 by 31 March. “The treaty is clear that the negotiation of an exit agreement has to take account of the future relationship between the parties. To do that we have to talk about the future relationship. So we would expect that we would discuss the topics in parallel,” he said. At the same time, he conceded that it could be necessary to create an interim deal to cover the “period between Britain leaving the EU and the full introduction of a long-term future arrangement between the UK and the EU”. “In such a case, we would have to decide what happens in the period between leaving the EU and the commencement of such an agreement in the interim period,” he said.', 'What do you do if you’re worried about how the EU referendum vote will affect your ability to travel freely across Europe or to live in a European country? The response of many of those who have dual heritage, or who have lived abroad for some time, has been to apply for a second passport. The number of British people applying for a second passport in the months since the EU referendum vote has rocketed. Figures show that in June 2016 the number of people applying for Irish passports had risen by 9% compared with June 2015. By November the increase was up 106% on the year before. We asked our readers if they’d applied for dual citizenship, and if so, why. Stephen Byrne, 63, from Scotland: I applied for my Irish passport to remain part of the European family\\nWhen my UK passport expired I decided not to renew it, but to apply for an Irish passport instead. I will never hold a UK passport again, partly as a protest against Brexit, but also because I want to feel that I still belong to the European family. The process of getting an Irish passport was quick and easy, though I had to talk the local postmaster into witnessing my documents. I might have considered relocating if I were younger, but my income is in sterling. If its value relative to the euro continues to fall (as I expect it will) I might find life abroad unaffordable. I feel saddened by the Brexit vote and still feel a real sense of grief. I fear that Britain may suffer the consequences for decades to come. The only cause for optimism for me is that Brexit may result in the breakup of the UK. If that happens, each country in the UK might negotiate European Union membership separately. At long last we might come to terms with the loss of empire and be less concerned about strutting on the world stage. Instead, we might become more peaceful and constructive members of the European family. Chris Dabrowski, 43, from London: I registered as a Polish citizen – until Brexit this was an unusual step to take\\nI was born, raised and educated in the UK, but both my parents were first generation Polish immigrants following the second world war. I did not want either me or my family to be limited in our future opportunities, and having experienced a blend of UK, Polish and Spanish cultures I know the benefits of global collaboration. That’s why I applied for a Polish passport. Getting the passport was complicated. Poland is an ex-communist country so labyrinthine bureaucracy is something it does well. First I had to register myself as a Polish citizen – until Brexit this was an unusual step to take, as there’s not much demand for immigration to Poland. The forms were long, complex and linguistically challenging. With my mother’s help, we went through the process and I now have an official piece of paper confirming my Polish citizenship. I still have to go through the second stage of converting the document into a Polish (and ongoing EU) passport, but this should be a formality. Ashley Beck, 58, from London: I was able to get a copy of my dad’s birth certificate and received my Irish passport fast\\nMy British passport is due to expire next year, but after the referendum vote I wanted to apply for an Irish passport. I was born in England but my late father was born in Northern Ireland in 1924 and I am an Irish citizen. I was able to get a copy of his birth certificate fast and received my passport in good time. I feel the leave campaign was in many respects motivated by a negative view of refugees, migrants and foreigners in general. I am a priest and a theologian and this is at odds with Christian teaching. Much of the hatred unleashed since the vote is a direct result of the nasty character of the leave campaign. This is a major worry for many of us in ministry in the Christian churches, and for many others. We must challenge everything about the vote. Laurence Diver, 31, from Edinburgh: After the Brexit vote, I discovered I am a German national\\nMy late mother was German, and I had a German passport when I was young, but had never renewed it because there was no need. After the Brexit vote I investigated my legal status. I discovered that I’m technically a German national (rather than just the son of one) and entitled to a German passport. The process was straightforward. I had to prove my mother’s nationality, but as I was her executor when she died I had all the relevant documentation. Germany issues a document to its nationals called the familienbuch (family book), and I used hers as proof. This, along with my birth certificate, proved that I am her son. I made an appointment with the consul general here in Edinburgh and they copied my documents. I paid a fee (£60), and the passport arrived about six weeks later. I am Scottish and am in favour of independence. If that doesn’t happen, and the UK continues down a xenophobic path, I would consider relocating to Germany, although I am aware that it has its own problems. I’d like to go to a vibrant place like Berlin, or one of its many university towns. Judith Bavarois, 66, living in Germany: I’m British but identify with Europe\\nI am in the process of applying for a German passport because that way I remain a European. I have always found England too small and take great joy in living in the middle of a continent with many different cultures to explore. I identify with Europe, but at the same time I cannot deny my English roots and my love of the language, the landscape and of many people back home. Having two passports is the ideal solution. Staying British gives me the right to be part of the conversation too. Getting a German passport is no big hassle: it’s not that expensive and not too much paperwork. All you have to do is a test on the German constitution etc and a basic language test. You also have to show that you can support yourself in old age, which is reasonable enough.', 'Theresa May must ask the European Union for a transitional arrangement to avoid a “cliff edge” when Britain leaves the European Union, and offer parliament a vote on the final deal, a powerful committee of MPs from both sides of the Brexit debate has demanded. As the prime minister prepares to set out her approach in a keynote speech on Tuesday, the first report from the cross-party select committee on Brexit, chaired by Labour’s Hilary Benn, says a transitional deal is essential to prevent economic disruption as Britain leaves. Its other recommendations include: The government should publish its Brexit plan by the middle of February, in the form of a white paper rather than the more limited briefing document Conservative MPs are expecting; Theresa May should give clear answers to whether she hopes Britain will remain in the customs union, and the single market, before negotiations begin; Any deal should strive to avoid tariffs and other “regulatory and bureaucratic impediments” to free trade; The government should seek to maintain “continuous, close cooperation” with the EU on security, foreign affairs and defence. The MPs also say they will be calling for evidence on the issues raised in the resignation email sent by Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s most senior diplomat in Brussels, when he quit earlier this month citing “muddled thinking”. Benn said: “We’re not asking the government to give away its red lines or negotiating fall-back positions, but we do want clarity on its broad aims given the significance and complexity of the negotiating task. This white paper must be published by mid-February to give parliament and the devolved governments time to scrutinise it.” The committee, which took evidence in Sunderland and Aberdeen as well as Westminster, includes prominent figures from the leave campaign, including former ministers Michael Gove and Dominic Raab. Gove, who was the co-chair of Vote Leave, asked at one of the committee’s early hearings about the possibility of a “quickie divorce” from the EU. Some pro-Brexit MPs are sceptical about the need for a transitional deal, which they fear could unnecessarily prolong the process of leaving and make it harder for the UK to strike new trade deals with countries outside the EU.\\nBut after hearing evidence from a series of business groups, senior Whitehall figures and policy experts, MPs from all sides of the debate signed up to the demand for a short-term arrangement to smooth Britain’s exit. The report warns: “A ‘cliff edge’ change in circumstances could be extremely disruptive in some sectors to businesses both in the UK and in the EU 27.” Benn said: “The government should seek appropriate transitional arrangements in the interests of business in the UK and the EU 27.” The report stresses the complexity of the challenge the government faces, with two separate negotiations, potentially to be carried out in parallel – the divorce deal from the EU, including Britain’s share in financial commitments such as pensions, and the details of a new trading relationship. It suggests the government should discuss carefully with the EU’s negotiating team how to phase the various aspects of the task. Emma Reynolds, a Labour MP on the committee, said: “I think it is significant that we’ve reached agreement on this report.”', 'Theresa May has said the media were responsible for a slump in the value of the pound by wrongly claiming her views about Britain leaving the EU equated to a hard Brexit. The prime minister was responding to a question about the negative market reaction to her comments on Sunday when she hinted that the UK would not be able to remain a full member of the European single market, but would instead have to negotiate a new trade deal. After a speech in London, May was asked if the markets were getting her vision of Brexit wrong, or if she was getting it wrong. She said: “I am tempted to say that the people who are getting it wrong are those who print things saying I’m talking about a hard Brexit, it is absolutely inevitable it is a hard Brexit. I don’t accept the terms soft and hard Brexit.\\n“What we are doing is going to get an ambitious, good and best possible deal for the United Kingdom, in terms of trading with and operating within the European single market.” The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, repeated her position that failure to accept the EU’s “four freedoms” would lead to restricted access to the single market. Speaking at the annual meeting of the German Civil Service Federation, she said: “Access to the single market can only take place under the condition that you keep the four freedoms [movement of goods, capital, services and people]. “If that’s not the case, you have to negotiate curtailments.” Merkel, who is running for a fourth term in the German election this year, said: “One can’t carry out these negotiations as an exercise in cherry-picking. That would have fatal consequences for the other 27 member states, and we can’t allow such consequences.” May also stressed that it would have to be a “new relationship”, because Britain would no longer be a member of the EU. “We will be outside the European Union and therefore we will be negotiating a new relationship across not just trading, but other areas with the European Union,” she said. Asked about Merkel’s comments, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: “We are about to enter a negotiation with 27 other countries. The British people made clear it’s important we take control of immigration, but this shouldn’t be a zero-sum game and we should be approaching this on how we can get the maximum freedom for UK businesses to operate in and trade with the single market. “There are many countries around the world that have free trade arrangements with the EU.” The prime minister also used her first speech of the year to flesh out her vision for a “shared society”, first outlined on the steps of Downing Street. May said the time had come for a “new philosophy” of fairness and solidarity, saying Brexit was a once-in-a-generation chance to step back and decide what type of country Britain wanted to be. Many of her comments will be seen as being aimed in part at her Conservative predecessor, David Cameron, and other politicians such as Tony Blair. In particular, May attacked the failure of “mainstream, centre-ground politics” to respond to public concerns in recent years, which had resulted in people turning to “the politics of division and despair”. “We see those fringe voices gaining prominence in some countries across Europe today – voices from the hard left and the far right stepping forward and sensing that this is their time. “But they stand on the shoulders of mainstream politicians who have allowed unfairness and division to grow, by ignoring the legitimate concerns of ordinary people for too long.” She said centrist politicians had embraced the “great forces” of liberalism and globalisation, but failed to understand that too many people on modest and low incomes saw those as things to be “concerned, not thrilled about”. The prime minister said she was talking about politicians who had supported an economic system that worked well for a privileged few but failed to ensure the prosperity was shared across the country. “[These are] politicians who made the deals and signed the agreements that changed the nature of their country, but failed to listen to the public’s concerns – dismissing them as somehow parochial or illegitimate instead,” she said.\\nShe said people were questioning whether globalisation was working for them when they were losing their jobs and watching their wages stagnate. “They come to a simple conclusion: that there is one rule for the rich and powerful, and another for everyone else,” she said. May said her government’s challenge was to show that centre-ground politics could deliver change, respond to concerns and set things right. The prime minister outlined the key social injustices on which she wanted to focus: racial discrimination, poor life chances for white working-class boys, gender inequality and difficulties for young people. She then focused her speech on new mental health policies, which had been trailed over the weekend. “An estimated one in four of us has a common mental disorder at any one time. The economic and social cost of mental illness is £105bn – roughly the same as we spend on the NHS in its entirety,” she said, promising to focus in particular on children. May gave her speech exactly a year after Cameron delivered a major speech on the same subject, in which he pledged £1bn of extra funding for mental health. May did not provide additional funding on top of that, but offered a strengthened package on mental health, including piloting approaches within schools to identify and support children in need. The prime minister has also commissioned two reviews, one of services for young people and the other on wellbeing in the workplace. May was asked whether she would ringfence government funding for mental health, given concerns that general pressures on the health service could squeeze this. She would not offer such a commitment, but insisted there would be accountability. The prime minister said there was a need to recalibrate policy so it was not only about the poorest. “Government and politicians have for years talked the language of social justice, where we help the very poorest, and social mobility, where we help the brightest among the poor,” she said. “But to deliver the change we need and build that shared society, we must move beyond this agenda and deliver real social reform across every layer of society, so that those who feel that the system is stacked against them – those just above the threshold that attracts the government’s focus today, yet who are by no means rich or well off – are also given the help they need.” Despite insisting that the government would continue to focus on the most disadvantaged as well, some campaigners fear that May’s positioning will reduce the focus on the least well-off in society.', 'Boris Johnson arrived at the Vote Leave headquarters the morning after the EU referendum hugging staff and “punching the air like Maradona after a great goal”, according to the man who led the winning campaign. Dominic Cummings, a former adviser to Michael Gove who was appointed campaign director for the leave side, said it was nonsense that Johnson and Gove did not expect to triumph and were consequently regretful. The pair seemed subdued at a press conference the day after the referendum as they liked David Cameron and “did not want to be seen as dancing on his grave”, Cummings wrote in a long post about the campaign on his personal blog. “Some of the media created the psychologically compelling story that they were regretful/frightened about victory, but this was not at all their mood in HQ on the morning of 24 June,” he wrote. “Boris came in punching the air like Maradona after a great goal, hugging staff and clearly euphoric. It is completely wrong to portray him as regretful.” The piece by Cummings, which runs to just under 20,000 words, credits the involvement of Gove and particularly Johnson for the leave victory, saying the vote would likely have gone the other way without the support of both. Cummings said Gove was vital in honing Vote Leave’s message, and without Johnson, Nigel Farage “would have been a much more prominent face on TV during the crucial final weeks” – potentially scaring off middle-class support. Cummings also said the hugely controversial pledge that leaving the EU would free up £350m a week to spend on the NHS was vital to swinging the referendum, as was the message on reducing immigration. “Would we have won without immigration? No. Would we have won without £350m/NHS? All our research and the close result strongly suggests no,” he wrote.\\nCummings also claimed that the NHS pledge, which he says was specifically to spend £100m more a week on health, was serious and would have been kept by Johnson or Gove, had either become prime minister. However, the main thrust of Cummings’ wide-ranging and occasionally rambling thoughts – at one point he spends several paragraphs comparing Robert Peston and other pundits to a character from Anna Karenina – is to emphasise the complex reasons for the leave victory. The post dismisses the idea that the Brexit vote was caused by an unstoppable tide of populist feeling, saying if only one of a series of very variable circumstances had gone differently, the result would have changed. Cummings wrote: Leave won because 1) three big forces [the immigration crisis, the financial crisis and the euro crisis] created conditions in which the contest was competitive 2) Vote Leave exploited the situation imperfectly but effectively 3) Cameron/Osborne made big mistakes. If just one of these had been different, it is very likely in [remain] would have won. Overall, the now-mocked conventional wisdom that ‘the status quo almost always wins in referendums like this’ obviously has a lot of truth to it and it only proved false this time because of a combination of events that was improbable. One advantage handed to Vote Leave, Cummings said, was a media “obsessed with process and the snakes and ladders of careers”, which thus heavily covered the involvement of Johnson and Gove.\\n“We could not match No 10 in the golden currency of ‘names’,” he wrote. “But we could give the media an even more valuable currency – a leadership story. “The media were understandably obsessed with this story, so we served it up to them in such a way that they also had to cover our message. For 10 days, we dominated the news with a set of stories on the Australian points system, VAT on fuel, Turkey, the NHS and so on, all based on ‘it’s safer to take back control’.” As is perhaps expected for a man known for his rudeness while working for Gove, Cummings is blunt about his opponents and allies, and admits he is “not motivated by people in SW1 [Westminster] liking me”. Addressing the charge that he dislikes David Cameron, with whom he had previously fallen out, Cummings wrote: Wrong. I do not hate Cameron. I do not respect him, which is different. I thought that he was in politics for bad reasons – essentially because he was someone who wanted ‘to be’, not someone who wanted ‘to do’ ... and his priority was himself and a small gang, not the public. I also thought Cameron was mostly (not all) bad at the job, despite having some of the necessary temperamental characteristics, and was flattered by having Brown then Miliband as opponents. Cummings described the most important part of his role in the campaign as “trying to suppress/divert/overcome internal coalition warfare to a level where about 10 crucial people were protected enough to do their jobs”. He reserved some of his heaviest fire for the media, saying most political correspondents and commentators should be fired, and for Ukip, who were involved in the unofficial Leave.EU campaign. Cummings wrote: Farage’s motley crew claim that I did this campaign in order to lose it deliberately, then get a job in No 10 with Cameron. It is pointless to discuss this theory, though the fact that they understood so little about the political environment, and struggled to use Google, was an important fact.', 'When a local councillor knocked on the door of Amanda Craig’s Devon bolthole, the novelist learned something that helped her realise, 10 years later, that the vote for Brexit would be a certainty and not a vain hope among Little Englanders. “He came round begging for us to give work to someone he knew,” she recalled. When asked why he was so desperate, the councillor replied: “People don’t realise, but in this part of the country we are poorer than Romania.” The writer, who is now based in north London, was astounded: “A lot of things have shocked me since about rural life, but that shocked me the most.” The experience inspired Craig to write her forthcoming novel, The Lie of the Land. A satirical take on the disparity between town and country, which highlights the emotional levers that led to the Brexit vote, The Lie of the Land is focused on a metropolitan couple forced to downsize to Devon because they cannot afford to divorce. The book moves between privileged middle classes and migrant workers on zero-hours contracts in a pie factory. Set to be published on the one-year anniversary of the EU referendum in June, Craig’s book is in a vanguard of 2017 novels set to tackle the state of the nation in the run-up to and after Brexit. June will also see Douglas Board’s political thriller Time of Lies. Set against the 2020 general election, a monstrous rightwing demagogue with a hardcore following of violent young thugs stages an anti-elite coup to win. Likened to Jonathan Franzen and Dave Eggers, Board tackles the response of liberals and the establishment to a populist power grab. Publishers predict that this trickle of fictional responses to Brexit will turn into a flood by the end of 2017. “I suspect we will see a lot more Brexit or Trump-America books once we have all lived through whatever changes these may bring [this year],” said Kirsty Dunseath, fiction publisher at Wiedenfeld and Nicolson. Though not written specifically about Brexit, Heinz Helle’s novel Euphoria, published by Serpent’s Tale in February, takes as its starting point a post-apocalyptic future in which Europe has crumbled and a handful of men are trying to survive in the Austrian Alps. Helle’s publisher described it as “Lord of the Flies meets The Road”, grappling as it does the anxieties of post-millennial European men. Crime writers have been fast to pick the referendum as a background for their next works. June sees the publication of Mark Billingham’s next Tom Thorne novel Love Like Blood, which uses the post-Brexit vote rise in hate crime as its theme. Billingham said: “It’s not the issue at the very heart of the book, but it’s bubbling under throughout the story.” Fellow crime writer Martyn Waites is working on novel The Old Religion – due in 2018 – that has the aftermath of the vote in a small Cornish community as its setting. Waites said crime writers were usually first to tackle social change because, among readers, crime fiction had replaced the social novel once produced by the likes of Alan Sillitoe or Stan Barstow. “As a crime writer you’re dealing with life and death – usually murder, because tax fraud is boring – so you’re looking into the society that created the circumstances for that to happen,” he said. Craig it was important for her that The Lie of the Land tackled the assumption that all leave voters were “stupid, racist and jingoistic … They are not. I don’t agree with how they voted, but I respect them and I think it is really important.” She thinks it is imperative for contemporary novelists to tackle the disparities in society that led to June’s result. “Since my previous book A Vicious Circle, I have been writing more and more about the gulf between the haves and have-nots, which anyone with half a brain should be worried about now,” she said.\\nThat two of the books published this year about post-Brexit Britain will be dystopian fantasies did not surprise Jasper Sutcliffe, head of buying at Foyles. He said: “We expect to see lots of new-world politics titles in 2017 to help people try to understand the new political reality, as well as more utopian fiction for those who wish to escape from it.” Not all contemporary novelists are rushing to tackle Brexit. Lionel Shriver said her next novel will be set in the US because “the UK-EU situation is in flux, and the outcome is likely to remain unclear for some time”. “Because a novel takes most of us a couple of years [to write] and another year to arrive in print, it’s dangerous for novelists to point a plot at a moving target. We can easily get overtaken by events,” she said. “To successfully address Brexit in a fruitful and lasting manner would require a novelist to parse: what is this conflict really about? Deep down? I think that’s anything but obvious.”', 'John Lewis has warned that its annual bonus for staff will be significantly lower than last year as it prepares to take a hit from the post-Brexit slump in sterling. Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the staff-owned group, which includes Waitrose, said he anticipated a “challenging” year ahead as retailers would have to absorb a big chunk of the rising cost of importing goods just as they are coping with shoppers’ shift to buying online. “Sterling, I think, is the dog that hasn’t really barked,” said Mayfield. He said a near-20% drop in the value of the pound had yet to affect most businesses because they had bought currency six months to a year in advance.\\nBut he warned that would now begin to unwind: “My view is quite a lot of [the increased costs] will be absorbed by retailers as we are in an increasingly competitive market place with excess of retail space. Even if it is passed on to customers it is not necessarily a good thing as it will dampen demand especially if we see a swing in inflation versus wage growth.” Mayfield said the devaluation of sterling was “one of the most significant factors overhanging the outlook for the year ahead.” This will be the fourth consecutive year that the group, which is collectively owned by its staff, has reduced the payout, but it is highly unusual for it to cut the bonus when profits rise. Last year its 91,500 employees, known as partners, were awarded bonuses of 10% of salary, the lowest for 13 years, averaging just over £1,500 each. The bonus payout started in 1920. It was suspended during the second world war and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. The highest payout in recent years was 18% in 2011.\\nIts decision to cut the payout comes despite a strong Christmas and expectations of higher profits for the year to the end of January, thanks to lower pension costs. Sales for the John Lewis department store business, including online, rose by 2.7% in the six weeks to 31 December as the group enjoyed strong trading in fashion and homewares. Online sales soared nearly 12% while store sales rose 0.8%, helped by the opening of two new outlets. The Waitrose chain also had a strong Christmas with sales at established stores up by 2.8% over the period, partly thanks to strong trading at the group’s growing network of in-store cafes and restaurants. Sales of its premium Waitrose 1 range, which includes specialities such as Sicilian lemon meringue eclairs, rose more than 21%. Mayfield said: “Although we expect to report profits up on last year, trading profit is under pressure. This reflects the greater changes taking place across the retail sector.” The shift towards online sales hits profits because of the cost of home deliveries and returns. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said John Lewis’s never knowingly undersold price-matching scheme was also likely to have cost the company profit margin as discounting across the market increased ahead of Christmas. Mayfield said the group would have to lift investment in product innovations, such as its premium Waitrose 1 food line or Modern Rarity fashion label, as well as developing infrastructure to cope with rising demand for online shopping. He said the group would also be investing more in its existing stores to ensure they could continue to attract shoppers. About 40% of John Lewis’s sales were online over Christmas, up from 36% last year, and Mayfield said there was no sign of a slowdown in the pace of growth. He predicted that the department store, whose new boss Paula Nickolds takes the helm this month, was likely to book half its sales via the internet ahead of the 2020 deadline previously expected. Mayfield said that John Lewis’s board had a responsibility to look at the long term rather than maintain the bonus for staff. “We have to strike a balance and we believe it is right to retain a bit more profit in order to invest in the future of the business,” he said.', 'Nicola Sturgeon has again insisted she is not bluffing about her threat to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence in the event of a hard Brexit. The UK government “would be making a very big mistake if they think I’m in any way bluffing” about holding a second independence vote just as the UK quit the EU, the Scottish first minister told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show. “I’m not going to sit back while Scotland is driven off a hard Brexit cliff edge with all the implications for jobs and the type of country we are that that would have,” she added. Sturgeon’s language echoed the language she and other leaders of Britain’s devolved governments used after a meeting with Theresa May at Downing Street in October. Then she said: “There is nothing I’m doing just now which is bluffing or game-playing; it’s not a game of chicken, it’s not a game at all. [I] don’t want to see Scotland driven off a hard Brexit cliff edge.” Since then, Sturgeon has published a detailed paper asserting that Scotland would be able to maintain membership of the single market and see freedom of movement even if the rest of the UK were to leave the EU. The first minister told BBC Radio Scotland on Friday that if the prime minister struck a soft Brexit deal with the EU, which kept the UK or Scotland within the single market, then she would put a second independence referendum “to one side” for the foreseeable future. Sturgeon said she was genuinely seeking a compromise deal. She insisted on the Marr show on Sunday that this proposition would allow May to honour her promise to English voters to quit the EU while allowing Scotland to keep the far closer ties to the bloc it voted for in the June referendum. It would mirror the deal being discussed to ensure open borders between the UK and Ireland post-Brexit, she added. Sturgeon hinted she envisaged staging that snap independence vote within the two year deadline set by the EU once the UK triggers article 50 in March, but refused to set out a clear timetable or deadline on a decision to stage a new vote. Constitutional experts and some within her own party, the SNP, believe Sturgeon’s options for a snap vote could be very limited because a final Brexit deal may not be clear until well into 2018 or even 2019. With Scotland’s economy now far weaker than before the 2014 independence referendum, Sturgeon’s opponents believe she is using the threat of a second vote to press for far greater powers for the Scottish parliament as well as to placate her supporters. All the opinion polls since October show Scottish voters are increasingly reluctant about a second poll being held before the UK leaves the EU, while overall support for independence has fallen back from a high of 53% immediately after the EU referendum to 45%. With about a third of SNP voters opposed to EU membership, Sturgeon’s opponents say she faces a significant challenge to win a second independence vote. But her strategists argue that level of support puts them in a strong position since they have not yet started a referendum campaign. The public consultation on a new draft bill empowering Holyrood to stage a fresh vote ends this week. They doubt many anti-EU SNP voters would reject independence even if it meant EU membership. With 45% still in favour of independence, it suggests they only need to persuade another 210,000 Scots among the 4.1 million-strong electorate to vote yes to win. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party leader, told the Sunday Times his party would press Sturgeon to stage that second vote if there was a hard Brexit. His party now has six MSPs, giving Sturgeon the necessary Holyrood majority to pass a referendum bill. SNP strategists believe their opponents are in a far weaker position than in 2014, since the catastrophic collapse in Labour party support and the still substantial dislike for the Tories in Scotland makes it far harder to find a natural leader for the no campaign. Sturgeon indicated on the Andrew Marr show that the SNP’s core message during a referendum would be the divisive prospect of Scotland’s fate being determined by rightwing Tories ruling from London for the next 20 years. “If we’re in a position where we’ve a UK prime minister saying no compromise Scotland just has to shut up and like it or lump it, then the question for Scotland – and it’s a much more fundamental question than just the EU or Brexit – is are we happy with that?” she said. “Are we happy to have no voice in the UK we simply have to accept the direction of travel that an increasingly rightwing UK government wants to impose upon us?” Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said the binary choice being offered by Sturgeon was far too rigid. Winning support from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, she said Labour’s counter-offer to reorganise the UK on a far more federal structure and give Holyrood far more autonomy would preserve the UK. “With power returning from Brussels, it is now clear that we need a people’s constitutional convention and a new act of union to reform where power lies across the whole of our country,” Dugdale said.', 'A hard Brexit could be the “biggest disaster” for British universities, costing decades of progress and leaving the UK’s international status diminished, vice-chancellors and senior academics have told MPs. An education select committee hearing on the impact of the vote to leave the EU on British universities was told that German and Irish institutions were “snapping at the heels” in poaching UK-based staff, while Oxford University’s head of Brexit strategy said the benefits of centuries of cooperation were being put at risk. Asked about the likely impact of a hard Brexit, Prof Alistair Fitt, the vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, said: “It would probably be the biggest disaster for the university sector for many years.”\\nProf Alastair Buchan, Oxford University’s incoming head of Brexit strategy, said: “We’re giving up 500 to 950 years of exchange – I think we need to be very cautious [about what type of Brexit is pursued].” Buchan, the dean of Oxford’s medical school, takes up his Brexit role on 20 January. His seniority and the status of the post is a clear sign of the gravity with which Oxford and other universities are treating the potential impact of Brexit. Buchan drew parallels between British universities and Premier League football clubs. “Our problem is the Manchester United problem, isn’t it?” he told the committee. “Every student and every staff member that comes to Oxford is a benefit for this country, because we recruit quality, people that play in the top league. “We need to be leading, and we have been leading as universities in the past 10, 20 years. Thirty or 40 years ago we weren’t, when we joined the EU. To lose that would be absolutely shooting ourselves in the foot – we must not do that.” Buchan complained that the Brexit department and the Department for Education had no way of communicating with universities about the problems they faced. Instead, academics were spending their time helping ministers and civil servants. “In the Department for Exiting the European Union, there is no structure of who we can talk to, there’s no base camp, there’s no one responsible for research or education in universities,” he said. “Likewise, in the Department for Education, there’s nobody really responsible for leaving the EU. So there’s a real need to see who is the channel or the portal for information. “They are very hungry for information, I’ve spent a lot of time explaining to them how it works.” Asked if the government had sought universities’ views, Fitt said: “I would say, largely, no.” However, he added that the universities minister, Jo Johnson, had been “welcoming”. Catharine Barnard, a professor of EU law at Cambridge University, said the threat of Brexit had “turned upside down” the lives of EU staff and students in the UK. She cited a survey by the university of potential students who did not take up a place, with a number of respondents mentioning “anti-immigrant sentiment” as one reason. Overall undergraduate applications to Cambridge from the EU are down by 14% so far. Other European universities were looking to take advantage of Britain’s difficulties, she told the committee hearing (pdf), held at Pembroke College, Oxford. “Germany is working very hard to see if they can attract British academics or academics from British universities to Germany, offering positions that have no teaching connected, research-based posts, and in Germany, much of the academic work is now done in English, so Germany is snapping at our heels,” Barnard said. “Particularly in the field of maths, the German universities are really looking to tap into the pool of talent that we are getting from Hungary and Poland. “Universities in other member states see Brexit as an opportunity to undercut. It’s a tall poppy – we are the tall poppy, we get more ERC [European Research Council] funding than any other member state, we are seen as the best. Germany is number two, significantly behind in terms of funding, and they want some of that action.” Barnard said the status of an elite institution such as Trinity College, Cambridge, was “largely due to Trinity’s brilliance in maths, which has much to do with the input of our Hungarian, Polish and Romanian students”. Buchan warned that Britain’s higher education sector could follow the US in becoming more insular and liable to being overtaken by China. “What we see in America, heading into Trump’s administration, over the past five or 10 years, has been in a reduction in funding, their collaborative publications have fallen off, their impact is beginning to drop. “Our worry is that China and India are in the ascendancy. We have been second only to the US – we need to be very sure that we negotiate the kind of openness that academia is all about,” he said.', 'A prominent Conservative supporter is backing a legal challenge to Theresa May’s plan to trigger the two-year process of negotiating the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union without a vote in parliament. Charlie Mullins, the head of the company Pimlico Plumbers, said he is one of the businesspeople funding a high court case that will question the government’s legal advice that article 50 can be invoked under the royal prerogative, which does not require parliamentary approval. It follows May’s speech to the Conservative party conference in which she accused those seeking a judicial review into the government’s authority of being anti-democratic. May told delegates in Birmingham: “Those people who argue that article 50 can only be triggered after agreement in both houses of parliament are not standing up for democracy; they’re trying to subvert it. They’re not trying to get Brexit right, they’re trying to kill it by delaying it. They are insulting the intelligence of the British people.” Mullins, whose firm has given more than £36,000 to the Tories, told the Guardian he is helping to fund challenge because he wants the clause that triggers the start of the negotiation to only be invoked after a vote in parliament. He has spoken to his lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, about the challenge and has met Gina Miller, the founder of the investment management group SCM Private, to discuss the challenge, he said. Miller is one of the claimants leading the high court challenge. “We are putting our dossier together to say that the people who should have the vote is parliament,” he said. “I believe that if it goes to parliament, people are going to see common sense on it. We are the ones who are putting our heads above the parapet. There are a lot of other people involved but they would rather not be known at this stage.”\\nThe article 50 litigation began in July following the UK’s vote to leave the EU. The action is being led by claimants Miller and hairdresser Deir Dos Santos, represented by Mishcon de Reya and Edwin Coe respectively, and is set to be heard in the high court on October 13 and 17. Mullins, who campaigned against Brexit during the referendum, said he expected to see a downturn in the economy if UK leaves the EU. The businessman, whose firm controls 200 plumbing vans across the capital, was a business adviser to David Cameron and George Osborne and has often been photographed with government ministers including Priti Patel at the Conservative party’s annual Black and White Ball. He received an OBE in 2014 for services to business. “We are faced with a big situation where we know what is going to happen in March. I think we are going to see a rocky road out there, I think it’s going to affect the economy and we are going to see job losses. If they put controls on migrants coming in and out then it’s certainly going to affect the building industry and construction industry.” In her speech, the prime minister also confirmed that the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, would be resisting the legal challenge in the high court, alongside James Eadie QC, Jason Coppel QC, Tom Cross, and Christopher Knight, who have all been named as counsel for the government. After the speech, Mark Elliott, professor of public law at the University of Cambridge, tweeted that May appeared to have “weaponised” the attorney general “in the service of democracy”.', 'Cabinet ministers have privately conceded that they are very likely to lose a landmark legal case on Brexit in the supreme court and have drawn up at least two versions of a bill that could be tabled after the ruling. Sources have told the Guardian that senior government figures are convinced seven of the 11 judges will uphold the high court’s demand that Theresa May secure the consent of MPs and peers before triggering article 50. It is understood that more than one possible bill has been prepared so that the ministers are ready to respond to any detailed guidance from the judges into what the legislation should look like.\\nIt is not yet clear when the decision is likely, but the Guardian has been told that the government has asked the supreme court for early sight of the judgment, to allow “contingency planning”. However, a spokesperson for the supreme court made clear on Wednesday that would not happen, saying: “It’s just too sensitive”. Ministers hope the court will allow May to put together a short, three-line bill, or even just a motion, which is narrowly focused on article 50 itself and difficult for parliamentarians to amend. However, Lady Hale – deputy president of the court – gave a lecture in November suggesting it was possible for the judges to go much further and demand a “comprehensive replacement” of the 1972 European Communities Act. Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP and former minister who campaigned for Brexit, told the Guardian he and colleagues were not too worried about the case. “I hope we get some common sense from the supreme court, but I don’t expect the ruling to hold up triggering article 50, and the vast majority of people whichever way they voted now want us to get on and deliver Brexit,” he said. However, some remain-supporting MPs and peers are hoping there will be an opportunity to amend legislation, for example to demand that the prime minister pursue the closest possible economic relationship with the EU. The Liberal Democrats plan to lay down amendments demanding a Brexit deal be put to the public in a second referendum and that 16- and 17-year-olds get a vote. Some pro-Brexit MPs have been urging the prime minister to adopt a “keep it simple strategy” – a phrase borrowed from management theory – ensuring any bill is as brief as possible, to minimise the risk it could be derailed. Mark Harper, the former Tory chief whip who backed remain in the referendum, said he believed the supreme court would only be able to demand that the government either produce a motion or a bill, but not demand any level of detail beyond that. He suggested May’s government would probably try to publish “something very tight that gives authority to ministers to trigger article 50 before the end of March”. Harper said that while it was not possible to avoid any amendments at all, a short and focused bill would make it difficult for MPs to cause trouble for May by constraining her room for manoeuvre during Brexit negotiations. He said that if he was still chief whip he would not be complacent about the process, but was “cautiously optimistic” that the legislation would be passed. Any attempt by the government or the claimants to obtain advance notice of the supreme court decision has been stymied. In most cases it is normal practice for the lawyers involved to be sent the judgment on an embargoed basis beforehand. In cases as sensitive as the article 50 appeal, the judgment is kept secret until the last moment to ensure that it does not leak out. A supreme court spokesperson said: “In view of the potential sensitivity of the case, there will be no copies of drafts available to anybody before the day of hand-down”. Ministers are planning to move quickly after a judgment to avoid the days of speculation and anger that followed the high court ruling, which took the government by surprise. The first step is likely to be a statement to the House of Commons by the Brexit secretary, David Davis. He is proving popular among MPs since taking up his role, with friends in the Conservative party planning a drinks reception this month to belatedly welcome him back to the frontbench. His ally Andrew Mitchell has joked that it is time for a celebration now it is clear that Davis, who stepped down as an MP in 2008, is not going to resign from this role.\\nOne rumour circulating in Westminster is that the government plans to publish a press release claiming a win of sorts if four judges rule in favour of the government, while seven are against. That is the outcome that ministers believe is most likely. And while they think they are likely to lose the case being brought by Gina Miller, which would require them to publish an act of parliament, they are more confident about other aspects. In particular, they do not think it is likely that the judges will order May to seek agreement from the Scottish and Welsh devolved administrations before starting the Brexit process. The prime minister will give a speech setting out her approach later this month, and she will later publish a plan for Brexit after signing up to a motion put forward by the Labour party. Moderate Conservative MPs had urged the government to table a formal white paper, setting out its priorities as it negotiates Brexit, including the answer to key questions such as whether May hopes to keep Britain in the single market or the customs union. But they now expect May to publish a less definitive “menu of options” amid fears that a detailed white paper could constrain her room for manoeuvre in the coming months. “The government is still very concerned that if it puts forward a white paper, it will be subject to amendment,” said one backbencher. Separately, the Scottish National party (SNP) is seeking to use the political crisis in Northern Ireland to ramp up the pressure on the government over its decision to table article 50 by the end of March. Northern Ireland, like Scotland, voted to remain in the EU, and the government has promised to take formal account of opinion in other parts of the UK through regular meetings of a joint ministerial committee as it enters talks. Deirdre Brock, the SNP’s spokeswoman on Northern Ireland, challenged James Brokenshire on Monday. She asked the secretary of state for Northern Ireland: “Now that there is no effective administration at Stormont who can speak up for Northern Ireland in the joint ministerial committee, and remembering that Northern Ireland voted to remain, can he tell us what he is doing to ensure that the interests of the people of Northern Ireland are being looked after when Brexit negotiations are considered?”', 'An industry known for being open and liberal, the technology sector certainly didn’t want to wake up to a smug and delighted Nigel Farage on the morning of 23 June. But like many others, the vote to leave the EU left some startups questioning where their future lies, particularly if they’re confronted with issues around employing foreign staff. While there’s clearly been no mass exodus, more than six months later some startups have made the tough decision to leave, while others are still pondering whether or not to start afresh in Europe. With so many tech hubs springing up across Europe, we take a look at the cities attracting British startups: Berlin There’s no question over which European city has been most vocal in wooing British tech startups. Weeks after the vote, Germany’s Free Democratic party kicked off a charm offensive by running an ad on the side of a white truck travelling around east London reading, “Dear startups, keep calm and move to Berlin”. This was followed in November by Berlin Partner, the capital’s marketing agency, running a pop-up lab in Soho highlighting what the city offers startups. But even hours after the referendum, Berlin Partner was inundated with inquiries from disillusioned startups. “The messages came mostly from startups telling of their plans to relocate to Berlin,” says Dr. Stefan Franzke, CEO Berlin Partner. “I guess that this was the result of the initial shock.” But for many it wasn’t just a fleeting thought. Berlin Partner says five startups have already swapped the UK for Berlin while it’s liaising with 40 startups interested in moving to the German capital. The chief executive of digital vehicle management firm Konetik, Balazs Szabo, says he was swayed to move their head office from Shoreditch, London to Berlin following the vote to leave. “The uncertainty of the future business environment in UK made us ready to move forward by strengthening our position in Germany.” In Berlin you’re part of a global and cosmopolitan crowd. “Berlin is international, with people from 190 nations,” says Franzke, adding that 50% of employees working at startups in Berlin are from other countries. Lisbon Lisbon was thrown in the tech spotlight when the city hosted the Web Summit in November, marking the start of a three-year partnership between the city and the global tech conference. Choosing Lisbon over Dublin, its backdrop for the past three years, and other European cities has helped carve Lisbon out as a burgeoning tech hub. “The fact Web Summit elected Lisbon as the city to run the show from is a sign of something,” says Rui Coelho, executive director of Invest Lisboa, the city’s promotional agency. “Portugal is known for its sun, beach, food and wine and now tech is about to take off.” At a time when many countries are talking of closing borders, Lisbon’s door is firmly open, with Invest Lisboa on a mission to attract foreign companies, including UK startups. Coelho beats the drum for the city. “We offer a good quality of life, good infrastructure, it’s affordable and it’s a great city to work in. We are opening our doors.” Coelho doesn’t have too difficult a job. Startups are already turning to Lisbon. On the second floor of Startup Lisboa’s office are the founders of EatAbout, an app that lets diners experience eating a meal in a chef’s home. Philip Källberg and Felix Bråberg moved their company from London to Lisbon in October. “Brexit didn’t make us feel good about staying in London,” admits Källberg. “We want to be a global company and if the UK has a hard Brexit it’s not the place we want to have our headquarters. That was the core reason we left, but we’ve also found Lisbon to have a relaxed climate and less stressful.” There’s another upshot: the move has slashed their workspace costs by around 60%. Dublin Just weeks following the vote in favour of Brexit and applications for Irish passports hit the roof as Brits turned to their Irish roots in a hope of hanging on to EU citizenship. In a city already home to tech giants such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, it’s no surprise that Dublin is an appealing alternative for startups wishing to remain in the EU. “Assuming a UK exit, Ireland will be the only English-speaking country in the EU and with advantages of talent, a well-developed ecosystem, the presence of large tech companies and leading-edge research centres,” says Marina Donohoe, UK and northern Europe director at Enterprise Ireland. “It’s is a great location for startups.” Donohoe says the government agency has received a number of inquiries from UK startups. “Some of the inquiries were triggered by concerns around access to non-UK talent and constraints on this going forward. It’s unclear how this will unfold but with 3.6 million EU citizens living in the UK the concern is quite a real one.” The uncertainty around Brexit certainly presents an opportunity for Ireland. Donohoe says her team will host formal workshops and organise one-to-one discussions. “Initially we aim to target the Irish diaspora, especially young professionals who may wish to come back to Ireland to start their own business,” she says. “We will also ensure that some of the key influencers such as those in professional services companies in London are made aware of what Ireland has to offer startups so they can advise accordingly and appropriately.” Amsterdam Home to the Next Web, the European commission awarded it the European Capital of Innovation 2016/2017, and it’s the fourth biggest tech hub in Europe by number of startups, according to research published by Balderton Capital (pdf). Amsterdam is a viable choice for disillusioned British startups, with StartupAmsterdam, an agency designed to connect startups and investors, reporting increased interest from British firms following the Brexit vote. So what does the city synonymous with cycling and canals, offer startups? “Amsterdam is Europe’s most connected tech city,” explains Bas Beekman, director of StartupAmsterdam. “The accessibility of the city, the journey between Schiphol airport and the city centre takes about 15 minutes, and its strategic location means Amsterdam is very suitable for startups wishing to expand into mainland Europe.” He points out that a number of renowned startups and scale-ups including Uber, Netflix and Tesla have offices in Amsterdam. He says the wide use of English in the Netherlands sets them apart, too. “This makes doing business so much easier.” And then, of course there’s the liveability factor. “Amsterdam’s vibrant cultural life, being able to bike to work and the low cost of living make it a magnet for the international talent that startups need.” While the UK tech sector remains strong and London still leads the way as the tech capital of Europe, the above cities, and more, are vying for those startups that need a home where there’s freedom of movement in order to attract talent. Whether it’s the beaches of Lisbon that sway you or you’re hankering after the urban grit and cool of Berlin, there’s plenty of destinations that will welcome startups with open arms.

Where once the choice was between hard and soft Brexit, the new worry in diplomatic and business circles is that the UK is heading for “train crash” Brexit, a scenario in which incompatible negotiating demands from Downing Street and the other 27 member states result in Britain walking away without a deal on either the terms of separation or future trading relations with the EU.\\nThat was the concern of Barrow’s predecessor, Sir Ivan Rogers, who wrote to the 120 staff at the UK’s imposing office block at 10 Avenue d’Auderghem to warn them of “muddled thinking” back in London. “Contrary to the beliefs of some, free trade does not just happen,” concluded one of the most stinging resignation letters in Foreign Office history. Aside from a groaning intray, Barrow inherits a demoralised and depleted team. He has just lost his deputy, Shan Morgan, who is due to start a new job in Wales, and gained a new turf war in Whitehall, where the top civil servant at the department for exiting the EU opposed his appointment and demanded to be in charge of talks instead. “The structure of the UK’s negotiating team, and the allocation of roles and responsibilities to support that team, needs rapid resolution,” warned Rogers in his farewell letter. Officials at the other No 10, in Downing Street, rushed to counter their outgoing ambassador’s claim that the government did not have a proper plan. A speech by Theresa May at the end of January will make clear, they briefed, that the top priority was ending the free movement of people and that, if Britain could not remain a member of the single market as a result, then so be it. After receiving instructions and rebuilding his team, Barrow’s next priority is convincing the other 27 governments that Britain is still serious about negotiation. Previous intransigence over wanting both free market access and an end to free movement have left many in Brussels thinking London misunderstood its basic membership principles. But even though the UK appears ready to concede the need for reduced market access and possibly ongoing budget payments, the new ambassador also needs to convince his counterparts of the need to negotiate any new trade deal at the same time as the talks on the terms of separation – or, at the very least, agree a transition phase. With EU demands for a divorce settlement of tens of billions of euros looming large, the Brits risk having to agree to pay this budget contribution before they are even allowed to move to the next step. Only then could Barrow get to the crunch issue for his political bosses, which is the negotiation of new trade terms. Rogers had warned that talks on a replacement free trade agreement could drag on for up to a decade. The swift appointment of Barrow, an FCO veteran and former ambassador to Moscow, was intended to reassure civil service mandarins worried that the government no longer wanted to hear bad news – a signal, it was claimed, that it was at least trying to strike a deal in Brussels. But the reaction from those in favour of a more hardline approach has only underlined the suspicion in Whitehall that many politicians secretly relish the possibility of walking away with no agreement. “It’s very simple,” claimed the Brexit-backing former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith on Wednesday when asked what the government’s objective was. “We are leaving the European Union.” “The only significant issue outstanding about our future relationship is trade,” added fellow Tory John Redwood on Friday. “I suspect, after all the huffing and puffing, they will want tariff-free as it is more in their interests than ours.” Despite Rogers’s withering remark that trade does not just happen, there is some support for falling back on World Trade Organisation rules if a new trade deal cannot be agreed. The view of Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is that even without a deal Britain can always temporarily rely on international tariffs agreed by the EU and strike bilateral deals in future. Though some WTO tariffs, such as those for cars, are punitively high, most would be tolerable. “It’s really not an abyss,” said Brendan McGivern, a WTO expert at White & Case in Geneva. “This is the basis that the USA and Japan trade with the EU. It’s a robust system.” The problem is that even moving to WTO tariffs would require agreement. Other signatories around the world would need to accept that Britain had a right to inherit the same rates negotiated with the EU. In the case of agriculture, where there are shared quotas in place to limit cheap imports, Britain would have to negotiate its share with French farmers or risk losing entire export markets. “People like Fox suggest it will be an easy and painless process [to inherit WTO rules] but I am not really convinced of that,” said McGivern. “It will be relatively easy for industrial goods but not for agriculture. Because the pie has to be split, it becomes a zero-sum game.”\\nSome even argue that this would still not prevent the UK selling the same products elsewhere. One reason forecasts by groups such as Economists for Brexit are more rosy is that they assume all trade eventually finds a global price regardless of tariffs, much like commodity markets for crude oil. The reaction of more complicated export industries, such as the British car industry, is one of horror. Exporters are not the only ones worried about the chaos that might follow a disorderly Brexit. There is also the question of where it might leave the dozens of regulatory agencies that provide vital services for the economy, or the millions of EU citizens stuck on either side of an increasingly bitter immigration row. Already there are concerns that so-called shared regulatory competences will unravel chaotically unless a comprehensive transition deal is agreed with the other EU member states. This is bad enough for those based in the UK, such as the European Medicines Agency, which has reported an exodus of skilled staff. But finding replacements for other vital bodies, such as the European Atomic Energy Community, presents a whole other level of challenges. Many of the Tory sceptics pressuring Downing Street fear all this talk of transition arrangements is a trap to prevent the Brexit referendum result from being implemented. “They are looking for ways they will be betrayed,” said Mark Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “They don’t want to get bogged down. They would rather just take the economic hit.” Timeline - Brexit spring January May gives speech outlining negotiating objectives. Supreme court rules on parliament’s right to be consulted.

Article 50 invoked allowing two-year period of negotiations to begin.', 'Dairy farms in Northern Ireland will “go out of business” after Brexit if barriers to trade with the Republic of Ireland are erected, the government has been warned. The risk centres not just on the potential loss of exports to the supermarkets in the republic but the loss of a highly successful global business in cross-border production of milk and cheese products, a House of Commons select committee was told on Wednesday. About a third of milk from cows in Northern Ireland is transported across the border for production into butter, cheese and infant formula, Mike Johnston, the Northern Ireland director for Dairy UK, told the Northern Ireland affairs committee.\\n“Dairy farmers would have to go out of business as a consequence of their milk not being able to be processed,” he said. He told the committee more than 25% of the region’s raw milk went south of the border to be processed but a hard Brexit would close down that flow, not just because of tariffs and customs checks, but because of the burden of paperwork relating to issues including traceability, animal welfare and food standards. He said 25% of pasteurised milk went south of the border for use in products such as infant formula. That business could ultimately be picked up in Northern Ireland after Brexit, but there was not enough time in two years to build facilities to replace those in the republic, he said. The Brexit evidence-gathering session threw fresh light on the specific challenges facing farmers on both sides of the border in Ireland. Politicians and business leaders on the island have warned of the “incalculable damage” Brexit threatens but the detail on cross-border agricultural business has until now not been discussed so publicly. Individual farmers and food manufacturers have been reluctant to speak on the record with the media. Johnston told MPs there had been “significant rationalisation” across the island of Ireland in diary production, driven by the need to compete with farmers in the southern hemisphere. This had led to “site specialisation” with infant formula plants in the republic, for instance, and the creation of the largest cheese processing facility in Europe in Dunmanbridge in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, said Johnston.\\n“This goes beyond hard or soft border,” said Johnston. “If we cannot overcome issues around labelling, traceability, common standards, then that business north and south would grind to a halt,” he said unless there was a transition period during which EU regulations “copied and pasted” into UK law would apply. “In terms of the border, it’s a major, major issue for the dairy industry. We are very, very dependent on what we call an all-island value chain. If we have any interruption in the current practices it is going to affect the longer-term viability of the industry,” he told the committee. The committee heard that Northern Ireland exported to up to 100 countries, including more than 50 countries which had a trade deal with the EU. Johnston told MPs that the current 15-16% tariff imposed on their products in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia would “at least double” once the UK withdrew from Europe. “That would kill that business,” he said. The committee also heard that 40% of lambs went south of the border with much of the meat from sheep going on from the republic to France, a supply route that could also be adversely affected by a hard or soft border. Barclay Bell, the president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, highlighted the challenges facing those trying to drum up business outside the EU and called on the government to put more effort into getting access to China. “We’ve been trying to get pig meat into China for years, it just seems to be a very prolonged process. We feel resources at Westminster need to be expanded in some way … there needs to be a speeding up of the process. Other countries seem to be getting access,” he said.\\nIf future UK exports to Europe were subject to World Trade Organisation tariffs, “quite chunky charges” would be added to agricultural products from the UK. Current tariffs on bovine products are around the 13% mark, while butter from outside Europe was subject to a tariff ranging from €1.90 to €2.30 a kilo, Bell told the MPs. The Northern Irish farming industry was also questioned about the heavy reliance on migrant workers, with 65% of the workforce in the food-processing business coming from elsewhere in the EU. Bell told MPs the industry would be crippled without these workers. “People from the red meat processing centre, they will tell you, local people don’t want to work in the food processing. They have basically said to us if we don’t have access to that migrant labour we’re gone,” he said.', 'First they were anomalies: the reports of European citizens legally living in the UK, but caught in some dystopian drama with the Home Office after the Brexit vote. Perhaps they were just administrative mix-ups, we might have reasoned: straightforward cases that ran into misinformed, computer-says-no immigration officials. Now the stories are becoming regular. We hear tales of Europeans – some of whom were even born in the UK and have lived here all their lives, or are married to British citizens and have children born in Britain – being forced to regularise their status, appealing to the Home Office for some stability and reassurance via naturalisation.\\nWhat they face is not a machinery that seeks to understand their plight or has regard to the sensitivities. Instead, they are confronted by a dysfunctional instrument made blunt and crude by historically inconsistent government policy on immigration – and that, since the EU referendum, has been rendered even more incomprehensible and inhumane by the lack of any coherent government plan for Brexit. Not only is the Home Office understaffed and under-resourced as the result of public sector cuts, it is also under pressure to deliver whatever results the government needs to stand any chance of meeting its immigration targets. The result is that, for up to 3 million EU nationals worried by the political hiatus, seeking reassurance from the Home Office is like running towards a cliff to flee a predator. Hitherto, the focus has been on non-EU citizens: on efforts to keep their numbers down both in terms of the right to remain and naturalisation. That has been behind the spasmodic witch-hunts of certain groups regardless of how much they contribute to the British economy. NHS doctors one day, overseas students the next – anyone who is above the radar and good for a headline. The guiding Home Office principle seems to be reject first, ask questions later, and in the meantime hope the applicant does not have the connections or resources to appeal. Immigration lawyers have told me that officials were at one point being incentivised, on the basis of how many applications they rejected, with Marks & Spencer vouchers. But immigration targets and Brexit are a toxic mix that changes everything: how else to explain yesterday’s baldly expressed admission from the Home Office that it now sees EU citizens in Britain, previously exempt from having to prove residency rights, as “negotiating capital”? The stories of how officials have already started to behave towards EU nationals speaks to a particular mindset, a bureaucracy infected perhaps by the same ill will, nastiness and recklessness that defined the referendum campaign. But the Home Office in particular, and the immigration system in general, has long made decisions not on the basis of merit or reason, but as a way of filtering out as many applicants as possible – either via exhaustion of resources or impossibly high barriers. This is why EU citizens who have lived here for decades, and are now applying for UK citizenship but neglect to include their passports (not actually a requirement, but a handy excuse familiar to anyone who has dealt with the Home Office), are not only having their applications rejected, they’re being told to prepare to leave the UK, despite already being entitled to permanent residency. One such applicant likened her treatment to a Monty Python sketch. That is true in terms of farce, but not levity. If the waiting or the rejections or the appeals don’t exhaust the anxious applicant, the costs involved in protecting themselves from the relentless machine surely will.\\nNothing demonstrates this absurdity more than the case of Dom Wolf, born to German parents in London, who applied for a British passport after the Brexit vote and now has to take the UK citizenship test because officials say he cannot prove his mother was legally in the UK when she gave birth. His incredulity echoes that of many shunted into a newly perilous position. “Holding a British birth certificate and having had my parents live, work and raise four boys in the UK for over 42 years, I made the devastating assumption that this would be an easy process,” he said in a letter to the prime minister. “Oh boy was I wrong.” At this point it is really tempting, for those born outside Europe, to say: welcome to our lives. If your worst-case scenario is a strongly worded letter that is later apologised for, or the inconvenience of having to take a test, don’t expect too much surprise from those of us who have long battled with this mighty bureaucracy. But Brexit lays bare the brutal way in which decisions about peoples’ lives and families are taken, and how facts they thought immutable – like nationality or the holding of a passport – can be withdrawn by a sudden change in public mood and a reckless government cowering in whatever direction the winds of xenophobia are blowing. Already there are reports of EU citizens being questioned about their right to use the NHS, and concerns about poor and elderly people who may struggle to fortify themselves against whatever ultimate decision will be made about their status. Brexit has revealed the unpreparedness of politicians, and these deficiencies yield great consequences for ordinary people who suffer when a bureaucracy turns brutal. It has also revealed the extent to which immigration law is damaged by populist thinking and underfunding. The hysterical view that Britain is a soft touch for migrants helped deliver the leave vote. The new plight of EU citizens is exposing the disjuncture between the immigration system we have, and the one we think we have. • You can comment on this article via our Your Opinions thread, which opens at 10am on Wednesday', 'A strong performance by the UK’s services sector in September has allayed concerns that a rebound after the Brexit vote panic would prove temporary. The sector, which accounts for about three-quarters of the economy, beat City expectations with buoyant new order books and a rise in employment, continuing a post referendum recovery that followed a dramatic contraction in July.\\nThe pound steadied on the news after falling earlier in the week to a fresh 31-year low of $1.27, while the FTSE 100 index of top companies retained most of its recent gains, losing 41 points to finish at 7033. Markit, which compiled the services industry data, said the strength of the recovery meant the chances of a recession in the second half of 2016 had “all but evaporated”. Combined with strong results in September for the manufacturing and construction sectors, the services data also dispelled any lingering fears that the Bank of England might cut interest rates before the end of the year. The financial data provider said the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the sector expanded at a slightly weaker rate than August’s 52.9, but stayed above 50, the boundary between growth and contraction, at 52.6, and the slump to 47.4 seen in July. Much of the boost came from a rise in new business, which rose at the fastest pace since February, helped by the fall in sterling. But Markit warned that the measure of company expectations remained very low by historical standards and businesses remained wary that the rebound could fizzle out. Britain’s car industry enjoyed a record September for new vehicle sales, but said Brexit uncertainty could weigh on future demand. The 66 plate helped to lift new car sales by a modest 1.6% last month compared with a year earlier to a total of 469,696, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Fleet sales increased 7.3%, offsetting a 1.7% decline in private buyer sales. It was the highest number on record for September, typically a strong month for sales because of the plate change. The top three best sellers were the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen Golf. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the service sector survey, said: “The survey results suggest the economy has regained modest growth momentum since the EU referendum, with further service sector expansion accompanied by a return to growth in construction and an especially strong revival of manufacturing. “Across the three sectors, the pace of economic growth signalled was the strongest since January, fuelling greater job creation as companies shrugged off short-term Brexit worries and enjoyed the benefits of a weaker currency.” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy was still growing at levels well below those seen between 2013 and 2015. “On past form, the index in September is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in services output of just 0.2%, still a long way below its 0.6% average between 2013 and 2015. “But fears that the slump in business and consumer confidence after the vote would translate immediately into lower spending appear to have been unfounded,” he said.', 'Brexit poses a risk to the global financial system and could spark more than 230,000 job losses, senior City figures have told MPs as they called for clarity on the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said Brexit could have an impact on “unimaginably large” contracts which are cleared through the City and which might need to be transferred to the 27 remaining EU member states or other financial centres. As Rolet called for a five-year transition period for the UK to exit the EU, MPs on the Treasury select committee were told the triggering of article 50 – the formal process initiating departure from the EU – in March could prompt banks to implement contingency plans to shift business out of London. “The ecosystem in London is a bit like a Jenga tower: you don’t know if you pull one small piece out whether nothing happens or whether it has a more dramatic impact,” said Douglas Flint, chairman of Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC. Ahead of the 23 June referendum HSBC said it could move 1,000 roles to Paris and Flint told MPs the bank was ready to take “pre-emptive action” before Brexit was completed. He pointed out that HSBC also had operations in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The outcome of the referendum has prompted European centres to make a pitch for the daily £440bn of business that is cleared through the City, largely through the London Clearing House, which is operated by the LSE. Rolet said the business was more likely to shift to New York than other European centres and called for a “grand bargain” with the incoming Donald Trump administration to resolve the matter. If the City did lose its ability to clear transactions denominated in euros – which was a contentious issue even before the Brexit vote – Rolet said 232,000 roles could be lost, citing research by consultants Ernst & Young for the LSE. That report has also been referred to by peers who said last month that thousands of jobs could be lost unless a transition deal could be secured for the UK. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, said last year that banks were “quivering over the relocate button”. When asked about this, Flint said: “Nobody wants to push the button. The best outcome for everybody is the preservation of the status quo insofar as possible.” He said it depended on the bank’s business model. Banks like HSBC which had operations in Europe “can take even longer to push the button,” Flint said, Citibank, he said, had a licence in Ireland but other banks operated in the EU through their London licence and might need to act sooner. Flint said that some US banks in London were able to transact with big European companies because they used a “passport” from their operations in the UK and were devising contingency plans. Those which did not have access to Europe would start to implement those “pretty much immediately on the triggering of article 50,” said Flint. Rolet said he was concerned about the “systemic impact” of moving contracts that are guaranteed by the London Clearing House if it was handled too quickly. The City has been calling for a longer period of transition to prepare for exit from the EU. Asked about this, Rolet said: “Two years is just too short.”A further three years after the two years of negotiation is needed, he added. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: “The unanimity among these leading City figures – about the need for a three-year ‘standstill’ at the end of the article 50 process – is significant. They argued that without such an arrangement, major banks and other financial services firms will take pre-emptive action at a cost, perhaps large, to the sector and the wider economy.” The vote for Brexit has sparked a debate about special deals for certain parts of the economy after carmaker Nissan announced it would develop its Sunderland plant. But Flint disagreed with the assertion by Labour MP Wes Streeting that this would be a bankers’ Brexit. Along with Rolet, and Allianz vice-chair Elizabeth Corley, he called for clarity on the UK’s hopes for Brexit in the eight to 12 weeks remaining before article 50 is set to be triggered.', 'I have fond, if somewhat fuzzy, memories of my first InterRailing trip around Europe. It was the summer of 1991, the iron curtain had fallen, war had broken out in Yugoslavia, and I had just graduated from Leeds University. I set off from London Victoria station with two pals, a money-belt stuffed full of travellers’ cheques (though, as it turned out, not nearly enough) and a copy of the Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable. My recall of our itinerary is sketchy, but what I remember vividly is the giddy sense of freedom we felt as the train pulled out of the station. Before gap years in Australia and Thailand became fashionable, the month-long rail tour of Europe was the preferred rite of passage for thousands of students. Launched in 1972 (a year before Britain joined the EEC, the precursor to the EU), the InterRail pass, which gave access to most of the continental rail network at a discounted rate, peaked in popularity in the mid-1980s, when some 300,000 young travellers a year would undertake the modern, budget equivalent of the European “grand tour”. Over the following weeks we rattled through eight countries, somehow managing to miss the major sights of every city we passed through. To keep costs down, we lived on bread and cheese and slept in grotty youth hostels, on trains, on the decks of Greek ferries and, on one memorable occasion, in a convent in Venice. Pockets were picked, hearts broken, bottoms groped, new friendships made, old ones stretched: it was gruelling and glorious in equal measure.\\nSo when I read this week that MEPs have been debating a proposal to hand out free InterRail passes to EU citizens on their 18th birthday, my first thought was: what a brilliant idea. My second was: oh. For if the scheme ever does get the green light – and there are numerous obstacles and objections to be overcome first – it will come too late for the teenagers of Britain, who’ve just been sold a one-way ticket out of Europe. The thinking behind the proposal – to rekindle enthusiasm for the “European project” among the young – is laudable enough. “People all around Europe must get to know and learn to cherish each other,” said Manfred Weber, a German MEP and supporter of the scheme. And what better way to get to know our European neighbours than to spend a long, sleepless night wedged into a tiny sleeping compartment with them, sharing crisps and life stories. The power of travel to expand the mind and foster empathy is well documented. But what if free European rail passes had been available to British 18-year-olds five years ago? Might the result of the EU referendum have been different? It’s one thing to know that we share this continent with dozens of very different nations, but for me it was another thing entirely to experience the reality and the wonder of that. To be able to board a train in Paris and to wake up the next morning in Venice, emerging from the Santa Lucia station onto the glittering Grand Canal. To sit down with a rail timetable and a map and reroute your journey, station by station, when the entire Balkan region suddenly becomes a no-go area. And to see first-hand, travelling through the former eastern bloc countries, the difference between life on the “inside” and the “outside” of this cosy European club.\\nAny initiative that brings such a life-affirming experience within reach of young people who might not otherwise be able to afford it is surely to be applauded for its optimism. But the reality for many young Europeans today is that a month bumming around Europe is simply not a viable option, even if someone does pay for the train ticket. And enriching though such adventures undoubtedly are, 18-year-olds would surely feel a lot more positive about being European if they had any prospect of say, getting a job, or buying their own house, or paying off their debts, when they leave education. Perhaps the real problem with these well-meaning proposals is that they are missing the target somewhat. Voting patterns in the referendum showed us that it was the over-60s who put us on the Brexit Express, with no prospect of getting off at the next station. The generation that was the first to benefit from cheap foreign travel and open borders, that need to be reminded why those things matter. There’s no longer any upper age limit on InterRail tickets and senior citizens are entitled to a 10% discount. Just saying.', 'Theresa May faces further criticism of her domestic policy in the face of Brexit pressures after it emerged that almost half of the staff in the newly created Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy admitted they did not know what the Whitehall office stands for. The prime minister surprised many in Westminster when she combined business, energy and climate change to form BEIS. The move, one of several changes to the makeup of Whitehall, was aimed at bolstering the traditionally weak business department, and checking the dominance of the Treasury. But as the business secretary, Greg Clark, prepares to launch the government’s industrial strategy later this month, it has emerged that almost half of his staff say they have no clear idea what BEIS stands for. In a recent survey, carried out in the autumn, many of the staff based at two headquarters buildings in London showed little enthusiasm for the reorganisation. About half (48%) of said they did not “have a clear understanding of BEIS’s purpose”; while 19% agreed that the organisational changes have been for the better. The shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, said: “This is not only a resounding thumbs down for the business secretary from his own staff but also an indictment on the prime minister’s flagship reorganisation of government, which seems to have left her civil servants as concerned as the rest of us. “She sent a dangerous signal by abolishing the Department for [Energy and] Climate Change and six months on there is no sign of the industrial strategy that was in the new department’s name, business is still waiting for answers on Brexit and the only jobs that they have created were changing the signs over their door on Whitehall.” BEIS’s headquarters is close to Victoria station but the department is also still occupying DECC’s former base off Whitehall, nearby. Insiders said being split between two sites had not helped the departments to pull together and that plans to bring all the staff into one building had taken longer than expected. Civil servants in several different departments are feeling the strain of a rapid reorganisation of Whitehall to equip the government for the task of managing Brexit negotiations, which are expected to begin formally by the end of March. BEIS’s role has also been complicated by the fact that some of its former trade responsibilities have been hived off to the new Department for International Trade led by Liam Fox, while the responsibility of liaising with businesses about Brexit has gone to the David Davis-led Department for Exiting the European Union. The department formerly known as the Department of Trade and Industry has been repeatedly renamed over the years, as successive governments sought to stress different aspects of its role – including an ill-fated, and brief rebrand in 2005, as the Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry, quickly dubbed “dippy”, and even “penis”. May’s inclusion of “industrial strategy” as part of the new department’s title signalled a more interventionist government approach; and an abrupt change of style from that of Clark’s predecessor Sajid Javid, who had said the two words did not belong together. Clark is expected to publish later this month a green paper that sets out the sectors and regions the government is keen to support, and how it hopes to increase growth and productivity outside the capital. Environmental groups reacted with alarm to the announcement that DECC was to be abolished, arguing that climate change would inevitably be downgraded as a priority, and suggested the low morale reflected the new department’s lack of clear purpose. Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: “Until recently, civil servants in the former Department for Energy and Climate Change had a clear, vital remit: to face up to the most important issue facing humanity. “Now, they are scrabbling around trying to patch up the damage that leaving the EU is likely to cause to our economy with little time for anything else. They have gone from being rightly recognised as international leaders in addressing the challenge of climate change, to a department that is now running to a standstill.” A spokesperson for BEIS said: “This year’s People Survey took place less than three months after the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy was created by the new government from two existing departments, resulting in a significant transition for staff. “The new department is at the forefront of much of the new government’s ambitious agenda.”', 'Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain edges towards the EU exit.

If you value our Brexit coverage, become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you. The big picture Maybe we should all start taking this “full Brexit” – or, as my colleague Dan Roberts called it – “train crash Brexit” idea seriously. Or, of course, maybe not. Theresa May gave what many said was her clearest hint yet that Britain will leave the single market when it exits the EU, telling Sophy Ridge on Sky News that immigration control (incompatible with single market membership) would be her top priority and that she was not interested in keeping “bits of membership of the EU”. The prime minister said she wanted “UK companies to be able to trade in and within the EU and European companies to operate and trade in the UK”, but stressed that Brexit was about “getting the right relationship” with the EU from outside the bloc: Often people talk as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are coming out. We will ... have control of our borders, control of our laws. A report from the thinktank Civitas gave the “full Brexit” idea legs, saying that while without a trade deal UK firms might face £5bn on their exports, Britain could levy £13bn on EU imports – leaving £8.8bn for an industrial policy including research credits and cash for disadvantaged regions. But May being May, no sooner had everyone responded to what they thought she’d said – including sterling, which dipped to its lowest level since October – than she denied it, insisting on Monday it was wrong to predict a “hard Brexit”: I’m tempted to say the people who are getting it wrong are those who print things saying I’m talking about a hard Brexit, that a hard Brexit is inevitable ... I don’t accept the terms hard or soft Brexit. All this followed an already turbulent week in which Britain’s highly regarded (in the EU and the Foreign Office, at any rate) man in Brussels, Sir Ivan Rogers, resigned, accusing the government of “muddled thinking” and “ill-founded arguments”. Rogers, who reportedly criticised May to her predecessor, David Cameron, before resigning and warned of the danger of a “disorderly Brexit” (in which the UK walks away from the EU without any kind of deal), was promptly replaced by another career diplomat, Sir Tim Barrow. The view from Europe At the start of the year in which Britain will, if all goes according to May’s plan, trigger article 50 and begin the process of leaving the EU, Joseph Muscat, prime minister of Malta – which holds the EU’s rotating presidency – said the bloc had never been more unified than in its policy towards Brexit. I spoke and visited basically all other 26 member states and there’s a ... convergence on the attitude towards Brexit. I have never seen such a convergence within the European family. The European commission paid tribute to Rogers, saying it regretted “the loss of a very professional, very knowledgeable, while not always easy interlocutor and diplomat” as EU observers predicted his departure would be a major loss for the UK. Marine Le Pen, the anti-EU Front National leader who is widely expected to make it to the second round of France’s presidential elections this year, said that if she won she would demand control of France’s borders, laws and economic and monetary policy from Brussels, and then call an in/out referendum. In news that will have little impact on the UK’s exit talks unless he actually wins (in which case he will resign as the European parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator), the veteran federalist and former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt said he would run for the presidency of the 751-seat assembly. He is though unlikely to get very far. Meanwhile, back in Westminster With May’s government visibly struggling over its approach to Brexit, surely this would be the time for the main opposition party to take full advantage? Not when that party is Labour, seemingly. Interviewed on Sky News on Sunday immediately before May, Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson made the slightly eye-opening claim that it was unfair to be asked what his party’s position was on immigration after leaving the EU. Watson did argue this was mainly because Labour – along with the rest of the country – still has no idea what sort of post-Brexit future May is seeking to chart. But his comments underline the fact that Labour is divided on what it is seeking from the Brexit process, especially over the free movement of EU nationals. While Watson indicated he would support some new if undefined controls over immigration – a stance also espoused by Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer – that position is by no means unanimous, with the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, still refusing to endorse any limitations on free movement. At least the Liberal Democrats have a united front on this, though. Well, not quite any more. Party grandee Vince Cable has said he now believes a “more rational” post-Brexit immigration policy will involve controls on movements from the EU. “There is no great argument of liberal principle for free EU movement; the economics is debatable and the politics is conclusively hostile,” Cable wrote in the New Statesman. (A Lib Dem spokesman was brutal: “Vince’s views are his own; he is not a member of parliament and does not speak for the party.”) You should also know: Scotland’s PM, Nicola Sturgeon, reiterated that she would hold a second referendum on Scottish independence in the event of a hard Brexit. Norway’s PM predicted a “a very hard Brexit” because the UK’s 40-year membership of the EU has left it lacking negotiating experience. Senior civil servants disillusioned over Brexit preparations are considering stepping down amid growing tensions with Downing Street. A top Canadian trade negotiater said the UK risks a “catastrophic” Brexit because the government is so dismissive of trade experts. The UK services sector grew at its fastest pace in more than 18 months in December as the economy continued to shrug off Brexit worries. The Bank of England’s chief economist said his profession is in crisis after failing to foresee the 2008 crash and misjudging the impact of the Brexit vote. The environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, promised a bonfire of regulations for farmers after Brexit. Lord Wolfson, pro-leave chief executive of clothes retailer Next, urged the government to lay out some of the core principles of its Brexit strategy. Britain risks losing €40bn of direct EU funding once it leaves the bloc, according to UK parliament figures. Some 42% more people applied for Irish passports in 2016 than in the year before the Brexit vote, Irish government figures showed. A 32-year-old man born to German parents in Britain who has lived here all his life was told to take a citizenship test. Read these: Leading Brexiter Michael Gove argues at BrexitCentral that Britain must get on and leave the EU as cleanly and quickly as possible because “the sooner we leave, the more we can do to deliver the change people voted for”. Anything less would be a “fake Brexit”, he says: Those supporters of the EU who still haven’t come to terms with the referendum result ... want to complicate and obfuscate the process in the hope that the public appetite for change will dissipate so they can secure a relationship with the EU which is as close as possible to the status quo. That’s why we mustn’t miss the wood for the trees. That’s why we need to deliver a Full Brexit, not settle for Fake Brexit. In the New Statesman, George Easton says 2017 will be the year the other EU states take back control of Brexit, showing up the sovereignty conferred by the referendum for the illusion he believes it is: It was Britain that voted to leave, but it is Europe that will decide how it does ... For this reason, Westminster, rather than obsessing over what the UK wants, should devote greater attention to what Europe wants. The irony of Brexit is that the internal affairs of EU member states have never mattered more: in 2017 it is not Britain that will take back control – it is Europe. And for Brexit aficionados, Alex Barker’s anatomy of a Brexit transition deal – why it is necessary, what it must contain, when it must be agreed, how it could become the crunch issue, and why Rogers quit over it – in the Financial Times (paywall) is essential reading. And if you’re in need of a little light relief after all that, my Guardian colleague Phil Daoust devised a splendidly tragicomic A-Z of Brexit that you can read right here. A brief sample to whet the appetite: Ja Obsolete German expression. Overwhelming majority Previously known as a “slim majority”.

Tweet of the week: Peter pretty much nailing it here ...', 'British companies are grappling with higher costs and bracing for further pressure in the months ahead as the start of Brexit talks threatens to drag the pound down further and ramp up the price of imports to the UK. Reports from the manufacturing and construction sectors on Monday point to a sharp rise in the prices paid for materials by firms in Britain and worries that their profit margins will be squeezed as they decide how much of those higher costs they can pass on to customers. Manufacturers’ organisation EEF flagged up higher costs in its latest survey of 281 senior executives although it found companies were generally upbeat about their own prospects in 2017, with hopes for improved sales. In the report, the EEF said: “Companies have experienced a surge in input costs, which soared to multiyear highs. As the weak pound is expected to prevail, cost pressures will be gradually feeding through into higher consumer prices in the year ahead.” Separate research by the Federation of Master Builders found 70% of the 232 UK construction companies it polled had recorded an increase in material prices owing to the pound’s fall since the Brexit vote. Sarah McMonagle, director of external affairs at the group, said: “Thousands of smaller building firms are grappling with the rising cost of materials caused by the depreciation of sterling since the EU referendum. “Anecdotally, construction SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] are already reporting an increase of 22% in Spanish slate and a 20% increase in timber. A quarter of all materials used by the UK construction industry are imported – this is significant and underlines the vulnerability of the industry to sudden fluctuations in the strength of our currency.” Economists have warned that the pound faces further swings on foreign exchanges with the triggering of article 50, expected by the end of March, to kick off formal talks to leave the EU. Some predict the effects of the pound’s weakness will lift headline inflation in the UK from 1.2% on the latest reading to as high as 3% by year end. The EEF’s poll noted pressures from other sources in 2017. With voters going to the polls in France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as Donald Trump’s presidency marking a change of direction in US politics, a large proportion of manufacturers said their companies faced more risks than opportunities in 2017. Almost half, or 46%, said risks outstripped opportunities while 23% said there were more opportunities than risks. EEF’s chief economist, Lee Hopley, said: “There is a real sense that there are way more risks than opportunities out there, obviously that is exacerbated by Brexit but we are not going to leave the EU in 2017.” Hopley said that despite their worries and with big questions over what kind of trade deal the UK would end up securing, manufacturers were generally hopeful of better sales this year and were still investing in productivity improvements. “The message we are getting from manufacturers is you can’t afford to sit on your hands for 18 months,” she said. The survey also showed a rise in the proportion of firms that think the UK was a competitive place to base a manufacturing business in the next 12 months. “For the next 12 months at least, respondents are positive, on balance, about the UK as a place to manufacture. Whilst this is encouraging, it could reflect perceptions about the current attractiveness of other locations, with unpredictability not just a UK phenomenon,” the report said. Companies were less upbeat about their profitability as they get to grips with higher costs, Hopley said. The pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has made imports such as fuel and metals more expensive. On the other hand, some firms have reported a boost to exports as the weak pound makes products and services cheaper in overseas markets. The Construction Products Association (CPA) suggested its members had experienced higher prices and were expecting further increases. Among those companies that made “heavy side” materials such as steel and bricks 78% reported an increase in annual costs. Among those making “light side” products such as insulation and lighting, 71% had seen an increase. Rebecca Larkin, a CPA senior economist, said: “Rising costs of imported raw materials continue to be a primary driver of cost inflation, but there is now an indication that currency weakness is filtering through to higher energy and fuel costs too. “The impact of Brexit on the construction industry is, as yet, unclear, but it is unlikely this year will be as buoyant as last unless government is able to provide greater certainty and the industry is able to manage cost pressures.”', 'Until about nine months ago, leaving the European Union was not something that sensible British politicians talked about. They hadn’t, really, since the country entered the bloc in 1973, the year that Theresa May sat her O-levels. In the intervening 43 years, as the EEC became the EU; and Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair came and went; and the Channel Tunnel was dug; and the borders spread to the east; and the euro was launched, and then foundered; our relationship with Brussels seemed, more or less, to embody a settled ambivalence towards the European continent that most British people instinctively recognised as their own. Close, but separate. In, but not integrated. Related, but not the same. We did not learn French. And then 17 million people voted to leave. Everyone has their own explanation for why. Not all of them make sense. I found out the other day that my wife’s uncle voted for Brexit because his son is training to be a doctor, and doesn’t like Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned for remain. Victory, as they say, has many fathers. Since 23 June, a great many things have been blamed – or thanked, depending on your view – for convincing the population that staying within the European Union was hurting us. Their names are more than familiar now. Nigel Farage. Globalisation. The rightwing press. The left behind. Professional politicians. Absent politicians. The financial crisis. Boris. Migrants. Project Fear. Sunderland. In their own way, and over time, these things helped create the feeling that we were trapped in something so defective, so inimical to our interests, that our best hope was to climb through a high window, and out. But you don’t get to Brexit without someone dreaming up the window – the remedy of leaving – in the first place. And during those long years inside the European project, that was the work of the right wing of the Conservative party. To be specific, a small, somewhat esoteric part of that wing: a flash of feathers, almost, a sect of true Eurosceptic believers who dreamed and schemed for this moment for the last 25 years. Most worked for little else, with no reward, and with no sign that they would ever prevail. “Like the monks on Iona,” as one of their former parliamentary researchers told me, “illuminating their manuscripts and waiting for the Dark Ages to come to an end.” And no one in that group worked with more devotion than Daniel Hannan, a Conservative member of the European parliament for south-east England. Hannan, who is 45, is by no ordinary measure a front-rank British politician. He has never been an MP, or a minister, or a mayor. Instead, since the age of 19, he has fought for what he calls British independence – fomenting, protesting, strategising, undermining, writing books, writing speeches and then delivering them without notes. For the last 17 years, Hannan, a spry, fastidious figure, who likes to read Shakespeare once a week, has done this mainly from the other side of the English Channel. He knows what it is to toil for a lost cause. “Here I am, Ishmael,” he told me recently, in his office at the European parliament in Strasbourg, invoking the Old Testament as he gestured around him. “Every man’s hand is against me.” Hannan may have contributed more to the ideas, arguments and tactics of Euroscepticism than any other individual. It was Hannan, in 2012, who asked Matthew Elliott, the founder of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, to set up the embryonic campaign group that later became Vote Leave. Elliott, who is 38, describes Hannan as the pamphleteer who made Brexit seem like a reasonable proposition for millions of people. “I can’t think of anybody who has done more on this,” he told me. Others laboured too, of course, and Elliott cited veteran Tory MPs Bill Cash and John Redwood, who spent decades attacking the constitutional and economic aspects of the EU – “but Dan is the only person who has successfully created a whole worldview,” he said. “And also then done better than anyone else to be the propagandist for it.”\\nHannan’s signature case against EU membership is an upbeat argument of direct democracy and free-market capitalism. He sidesteps questions about the inevitable trade-offs of leaving by insisting there will be none. Elliott was an intern when he first heard Hannan speak in Westminster almost 20 years ago. Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP, was convinced by Hannan that Britain should pull out, in the autumn of 1993. “When I heard Boris Johnson and all those others making those brilliant points they made,” Carswell told me recently, “I thought, ‘Compare it to making a film: these guys on the silver screen are brilliant. But the script is written by Hannan, and this is largely a Hannan production.’” Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, who helped persuade David Cameron to allow his cabinet to campaign freely during the vote, was “radicalised”, in her phrase, by Hannan during her time as an MEP. “On the morning of 24 June, I texted Dan congratulating him on changing the course of European history.” And yet, Hannan is not a household name. He didn’t break out during the campaign. Fellow Brexiteers told me there were prosaic reasons for this. “The broadcasters had their own hierarchy for their own reasons,” said Michael Gove. “They took the view that some people were box-office and some people weren’t.” Besides, to allies and enemies alike, Hannan’s role has never been on centre stage. Trying to characterise his contribution to Brexit, many people I spoke to likened him to dogmatic intellectuals from the past who came first and prepared the way. Admirers mentioned Patrick Henry and Tom Paine, whose writings catalysed the American Revolution. Opponents compared Hannan to Trotsky. “You have got to have hard arses,” the Marquess of Salisbury, a long-term Eurosceptic and Hannan supporter, told me, “who are morally courageous, who consistently make the arguments, who don’t mind being unfashionable.”\\nThe other explanation, however, is that in the climactic moment – when Brexit was put to the people – it wasn’t Hannan and his debating points that carried Britain out of the European Union, but a smaller, darker, set of instincts altogether. The final weeks of the Vote Leave campaign, with its focus on immigration and posters about Turkey joining the EU, were like nothing out of a sonorous Hannan speech. (His own 217-page book, Why Vote Leave, contains a single sentence on immigration, and Hannan supports Turkish membership of the bloc, in principle.) In the eyes of Ukip, the narrow, Hannanite case for Brexit – mostly about deregulation and sovereignty – was a sideshow next to the real event: a chorus of economic and cultural discontent. “In his own way, he is an idiot savant,” said Gawain Towler, Nigel Farage’s spokesman. “So locked up in his world that he can’t see what is on the end of his well-formed aquiline nose.” Hannan himself is almost impossible to pin down on these questions. He is agile and skilful when he talks – like a star witness with absolutely nothing to hide – and during several conversations this summer, he showed no anxiety at all about the manner of Britain’s decision to leave the EU, or the scale of the diplomatic and economic challenges facing the country. Whenever he could, Hannan would muse on the fair-mindedness and natural intelligence of the British people, and spar with the ideas of his many opponents. “If you’re told that ‘Brexit was all about immigration,’ you can be almost certain that you’re talking to a Remain voter,” ran a sample, recent tweet. For the rest of us, the patience and ruthlessness of the long-term leavers – a tiny band, fiddling at the political margins for a quarter of a century – will always be a breathtaking thing. “It’s revenge of the nerd,” one current cabinet minister, who voted remain, told me. “I was in awe of it.” But he observed that in all the years of plotting, there had been scant planning for the part that comes next, and no guarantee the agitation will now stop. “None of these people are builders, they are destroyers,” the minister said. “They are frightening people. They are like arsonists.” If Hannan has ever felt a moment of fear, or doubt, about his life’s work, you suspect that he will never admit it, even to himself. His term as an MEP runs out in 2019, and he plans to leave politics after that – the work of a singular, premeditated career complete. “Mission accomplie,” Hannan quipped to me, on two separate occasions. “As we like to say in Brussels.”\\n* * * Once Britain became part of the European Economic Community, the idea of leaving it went away. A few old-stagers from the 1975 referendum on membership fought on – isolated high Tories and leftwingers, like soldiers left behind in the woods – but the cause was dead. The European project meant cheaper prices in the shops, and its force was unarguable. That began to change in the twilight of the cold war. In 1988, from the great medieval Belfry of Bruges, Margaret Thatcher decried a European superstate on the horizon, with a character and goals that were different from her own. “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level,” she said. The “Bruges speech” established a new form of Euroscepticism. It saw a parallel between the disintegrating, clapped-out USSR and the folly of a new federal entity, designed in Brussels. It loved America, and Nato. It wanted a world of liberal nation states. Thatcher was in office to see the Berlin Wall come down. But then, like a confusing, bad dream for her most loyal supporters, she fell, and the Maastricht treaty materialised, with its portents of the euro, political integration and everything that she had warned against. Hannan was part of a particular generation of young Conservatives deeply marked by these events. He was in his first term at Oxford, studying history at Oriel, when Thatcher resigned on 23 November 1990. Twenty-three days later, John Major approved an early draft of Maastricht. The sense of a mighty mistake being made has never left Hannan. By the end of term, he had founded a university society, the Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain, at the Queen’s Lane cafe on Oxford High Street. “I remember swearing what the old adventure stories would call a terrible oath to do something,” he told me. Hannan had spent the summer travelling through the fragmenting societies of communist eastern Europe. He had seen crowds demanding the return of national borders, languages and flags. His CIB co-founders were another history student, called James Ross, who is now a composer, and Mark Reckless, the former Conservative and then Ukip MP. Hannan and Reckless had been to Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, together. They bumped into each other that summer in Budapest. The CIB came to dominate conservative student politics at Oxford at a time of acute ideological anxiety. Nicky Griffiths, later Morgan, the former education secretary, was a member. “There were all these countries and societies and economies up for grabs,” she said. Most students were all over the place, figuring out what they believed in, but not Hannan. “He was clearly the leader,” said Mark Littlewood, the current director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market thinktank. Littlewood was pro-Maastricht and frequently found himself up against the dapper star of the CIB in debates at the Oxford Union. “Nightmare,” he told me. Handkerchief in his top pocket, Hannan wiped the floor with all comers, despite having a slightly odd, otherworldly quality. “I mean this in the fondest possible way,” said Littlewood, “you could almost think, this is someone from a slightly previous age.”\\nHe was, in a way. The only child of ageing parents, Hannan was born in Lima, Peru in 1971. He was raised on a poultry farm outside Chaclacayo, not far from the capital. The Hannans, who had come from Lancashire to Latin America after the first world war, were part of a once-prosperous British expat community in the country. But the nation of Hannan’s childhood was destabilised by coups and anticolonial feeling. One of his early memories is of his father, Hugh, frail with illness, facing down a mob who had come to seize the estate. Hannan boarded in the Cotswolds from the age of eight. Britain in 1979 was a revelation. “I couldn’t understand these adults saying England is finished, going to the dogs,” he said. “No one in Peru spoke like that.” Ever since, friends and foes have remarked on the power of Hannan’s learnt patriotism. Roger Scruton, the conservative writer and philosopher, first met Hannan when he gave a seminar to sixth-formers at Marlborough. “The expat mentality is belonging to the old country,” Scruton told me, “and the inability to accept that it is changed beyond repair.” At Oxford, Hannan’s screeds on Maastricht quoted Aristotle, Shakespeare and William Pitt the Younger. But he also had an eye for a stunt. Conservative ministers visiting the CIB were ambushed and photographed with anti-EU T-shirts, while Hannan’s speeches – as his writings are now – were littered with arch, aphoristic observations. Lord Salisbury was able to run the British empire with 52 civil servants. King’s College, Cambridge, has produced more Nobel prize winners than France. The world’s oldest parliaments all hail from small islands. Goldman Sachs wants you to vote remain. “A Hannan soundbite does stick with you,” said Littlewood. “He does make you think.” The Eurosceptic heroes of the time were the 22 Conservative MPs who rebelled against the Maastricht bill in May 1992, almost bringing down the government. The following spring, as he was about to graduate, Hannan wrote to them and offered himself as their researcher. Around a dozen agreed to form the European Research Group (ERG), with Hannan as its secretary. In Westminster, the ERG was part of a lattice of energetic, new anti-EU organisations, such as Patrick Robertson’s Bruges Group, and Bill Cash’s European Foundation. Hannan joined the young activists who staffed the offices and wrote the pamphlets. He and Reckless, who was then working as an economist at SG Warburg investment bank, shared a flat above the John Snow pub in Soho. They hung a huge Union Jack over the fire escape, threw parties and believed they were on to something much bigger and more alive than keeping a fading government in power. “Don’t ever make the mistake of thinking Dan was a young fogey,” said Douglas Carswell, who met Hannan while he was on work experience in the Commons that year. “This was a radicalised streak of thinking.” The job of the ERG was to keep the European debate alive, and to make contact with like-minded campaigners across the continent. But Hannan and his group also consciously sought to bend the Conservative party to their thinking. “For us the EU was the litmus test for the generation above us,” Reckless told me. After the defeat to Labour in 1997, they attached themselves to Michael Howard as the most Eurosceptic candidate to lead the Conservatives. Gove, who was writing for the Times, remembers meeting Hannan, who was supplying lines and jokes for Howard to use in the House of Commons, that summer. “He was very, very clear-minded and clear-sighted,” Gove told me. “Some people find certainty attractive. Other people find it unsettling.” Hannan was 24 years old. For all its fervour, though, Euroscepticism in the late 1990s could not have been more unfashionable. New Labour was ascendant, and openly intent on deeper integration with the EU. In the summer of 1998, Tony Blair praised the incoming single currency and the prospect of Britain adopting the euro became the next line of battle in the European debate. The ERG published a paper, The Euro: bad for business, written by Reckless, and Hannan organised two conferences on the subject before helping to establish Business for Sterling, a single-issue pressure group to fight what was, at the time, a widely expected referendum. Largely forgotten now, Business for Sterling set the template, and included some of the key personnel, for the 2016 leave campaign. (Vote Leave’s initial vehicle, Business for Britain, was named in homage.) Although the group was chaired by Tory rebels and right-leaning grandees – led by Rodney Leach, a merchant banker, who later became a lord; Rupert Hambro, of Hambros Bank, and the Marquess of Salisbury – it was outwardly cross-party and apolitical. “Business for Sterling were the first campaign to sort of bring those concerns out of the political margins and into the real mainstream,” Theresa Villiers told me.\\nNick Herbert, who had run the Countryside Alliance, was in charge. (This year, Herbert, who is now an MP, led the Conservative campaign for remain.) He hired a brilliant young campaign director, a former investment analyst, whose last job had been in Russia, called Dominic Cummings. Hannan was by now flitting back and forth between the ERG and his job writing leaders for the Daily Telegraph. He thought about how to frame the European question for a national audience. “This was when I started realising how much the mechanics of a campaign matter,” he told me. “Simply by talking about keeping the pound rather than opposing the euro, we added 15 points.” Business for Sterling recruited Bob Geldof, Vic Reeves and thousands of students to its cause. It helped keep opinion polls set against joining the Euro and deterred the new Labour government, and its pro-European allies in the City, at their moment of peak of popular influence. Hannan and Cummings and the rest of the new crowd – all in their 20s – came away with their first victory scars against the establishment. “We did feel that bonding that comes from a ridiculed minority,” said Hannan. Eighteen years later, many of Business for Sterling’s funders and supporters gathered to the flag again. Villiers was one of many long-term Eurosceptic campaigners who realised that, although they were underdogs, they had fought a version of this battle before. “It is funny,” she told me. “Almost at every point I assumed remain would win. But it certainly did occur to me the disadvantage they had was they had been thinking about this referendum for possibly a year. Whereas people like Dan, it has been their life’s work. The whole of their adult working life had been building to this moment.” * * * Business for Sterling succeeded because it found language and symbols – the Queen’s head on a fiver – that touched the nerves of millions of people. Pulling out of the EU was a different ball game. There was no word for Brexit in the 1990s. Even Eurosceptic MPs didn’t mention it as an option. The language of choice for Tory rebels was of “reform”; “fundamental reform” if they were feeling brave. “Whatever weasel words,” Reckless told me. “Dan and I were always clear that our objective was leaving the EU, and that was what we were working towards.” Hannan was one of the first elected British politicians to suggest the idea publicly. In the spring of 1998, believing a referendum on the euro was imminent, he began to look for a seat in the European parliament. Tory MEPs were among the most ardent pro-Europeans in the party, and it seemed like a logical, if audacious, place to take the fight. Hannan’s age – he was now 26 – and his polished, bracing stump speech marked him out from the other candidates. “I was saying we should take powers back and we shouldn’t be afraid to come out if we can’t,” he told me. Conservative party activists loved it, but Hannan’s bold language alarmed party headquarters. “I was told that he was a fanatic,” said Edward McMillan-Scott, the leader of the Tory bloc of MEPs at the time. McMillan-Scott tried to sabotage Hannan’s campaign, and the young candidate was questioned furiously at an open primary at the London Arena in May. But the ploy backfired. Hannan delighted the crowd again, and the following summer, he was elected to the European parliament as a Conservative candidate for the south-east.\\nOnce inside the heart of the EU, Hannan set about discrediting it. A former researcher in his office told me that duties were divided between responding to constituents and “the more naughty stuff” of seeking out waste and hypocrisy in Brussels for Hannan’s column in the Sunday Telegraph. Hannan fell out with most of his Conservative party colleagues when he wrote about the expenses they were able to claim, but he did not relent. “I was building a campaign to delegitimise the institution,” he said. In the plenary chamber, Hannan used his allotted speaking time to rail against the statist, Bonapartist European project. Fellow MEPs, particularly from abroad, listened to Hannan’s ornate rhetoric in bewilderment and dismay. “The Spanish, we don’t have these imperial dreams to go back to. We are realistic,” Antonio López-Istúriz White, an MEP from Spain’s conservative Partido Popular, told me. “There is something in his life that probably affected him.” From day one in Brussels, Hannan also sought to bring the Tories out of their moderate grouping, the European People’s party, or EPP, and to ally them with more critical, anti-EU voices in the European parliament. Since 1979, the party had sat alongside fellow centre-right parties from countries such as Germany and Spain. But hardline Eurosceptics believed that this meant that Tory MEPs absorbed the meeker, pro-European tendencies of their continental colleagues. At first Hannan simply sat alone. But after six years of hectoring and arguing, and as new, Eurosceptic Conservative candidates were elected, he moved the entire bloc to his position. In 2005, Hannan extracted a promise from David Cameron – then a leadership contender – that the Tories would leave the EPP. In 2009, they did. (McMillan-Scott was driven out of the party.) Concentrating on arcane goals such as breaking up the EPP was a telltale move of the hardcore Eurosceptics. Another inch gained. Another bolt loosened. “Our goal in politics should not be to get the right people in,” Hannan told me once, paraphrasing Milton Friedman, the American free-market economist. “It should be to set the incentives so that even the wrong people will do the right things.” But behaving like this, and working to another order of events, separated Hannan and the other Maastricht diehards – even from fellow Tories who might otherwise agree with them. “The view at the centre was these were the people who had kept the Conservative party out of power for years,” said Gove. “Whatever they are most passionately in favour of must perforce be at best eccentric, at worst electoral disaster.” One new MP in 2005 remembered being lobbied to support the move out of the EPP and asking an older colleague for advice. “He said, ‘You just cannot. It looks good. But you cannot give an inch to these guys because they will never, ever accept it. They will take and take and take until they have won.’” Several Conservative MPs I spoke to for this article compared Hannan and his set to “entryists” and “Trots” for their ideological purity, their quest to reassert what they regard as Britain’s lost place in the world. “They are grammar-school imperialists,” one MP told me. “A hundred years ago Hannan and his ilk would have been able to vent their rather bizarre beliefs bullying people in a nether-province of India.” Hannan says such insults have never bothered him. “It passes by as the idle wind that I respect not,” he said. He simply regards himself as a different kind of a politician. “I think public life for me has a slightly didactic role, OK,” he said. “You should be trying to shift the centre ground of public opinion.” Since becoming an MEP, Hannan has written six books, from polemics, such as The New Road to Serfdom, a critique of America’s “European” drift under President Obama; to historical homilies such as How We Invented Freedom & Why It Matters, a 400-page exploration of the genius of English liberty, tracing its origins back to Anglo-Saxon witans and the Magna Carta. Operating apart, however, means that Hannan can sound alarmingly unlike most other British politicians. How We Invented Freedom includes a long extract from a speech made by Enoch Powell on St George’s Day, 1961. Another devout Eurosceptic, Powell eulogised the English language that day as “tuned already to songs that haunt the hearer like the sadness of spring”. The one-time health minister is now remembered for his “rivers of blood” speech of 1968, but Hannan frequently cites Powell as the model of the opinion-forming politician he would like to be, describing him, when we spoke, as the “supreme exemplar of that in his generation”. For years, within the Tory party, Hannan was also notorious for helping to write William Hague’s so-called “foreign land” speech in 2001. The speech’s attacks on Europe and tough line on asylum seekers were perceived as racist, and it is still regarded as a nadir in the party’s recent political messaging. But when we talked about the speech this summer, Hannan said: “There is sort of a hobbit-like element to a lot of British people. They don’t want to be told something until they have worked it out for themselves.” Still, there were times when the road seemed so long, and so hard, that Hannan despaired. In 2005, the EU seemed to defy referendums in both France and the Netherlands, where voters rejected a new constitution for the bloc, by repackaging the proposed reforms and forcing them through under a new name: the Lisbon treaty. Hannan wondered whether the whole project was in fact unstoppable. “They’ll do it all by stealth,” he thought, “and they will get to where they want to go.” Cameron’s new-look party was determined “to stop banging on about Europe” and Hannan came close to joining Ukip. In 2007 and 2008, he met Farage several times to discuss his defection, but in the end, the Tories broke with the EPP, and he stayed with the Tories. In November 2009, though, the Conservatives abandoned their own manifesto promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Hannan called Cameron’s office to resign from his duties in Brussels – he was the party’s legal affairs spokesman in Europe. A senior aide picked up the phone. “I said … I just think you’ve made the most terrible mistake,” Hannan recalled. But he promised to step down without publicity. The adviser thanked him, and asked Hannan what he planned to do next. “I’m going to devote myself full time to securing and then winning a referendum on leaving the EU,” Hannan replied. The aide laughed down the line. “Good luck with that.”\\n* * * Hannan put the phone down. He was in his office in Brussels. The Macauley poem, Horatius at the Bridge, entered his mind: “Who will stand on either hand / And keep the bridge with me?” He thought of Carswell and Reckless, his closest friends in politics, whom he spoke to almost every day. (Reckless became a Conservative MP a few months later.) Then Hannan ran through his old, Eurosceptic allies. He ended up in touch with the Democracy Movement, a descendant of James Goldsmith’s Referendum party, which had entered candidates in the 1997 election. At the time, the Democracy Movement had its own plan to bring about an in-out referendum in the UK, which was called the People’s Pledge. Like other successful Eurosceptic campaigns, the People’s Pledge was scrupulously cross-party – it had mainly Labour staffers – and didn’t make the mistake of asking for too much. The premise was simple: it identified Labour and Conservative MPs under pressure from Ukip in their constituencies, and asked them to publicly support a referendum on the EU. The People’s Pledge launched in March 2011. By October, there was a petition signed by 100,000 people, a debate in parliament and 81 MPs signed up, more and less against their will. Hannan spoke at rallies and impressed donors. Europe was the last thing that the Conservative-led coalition government wanted to address. There was so much else to attend to. The economy. Public service reform. The big society. “Oh God, so annoying,” is how a former Cameron adviser described the pressure from the Eurosceptics. “Constantly demanding to see the prime minister.” Gove, then education secretary, felt particularly torn whenever the subject came up. The tactics of the People’s Pledge, and Hannan’s role in it, made many of his colleagues uneasy. On the substance of the argument, however, Gove sided with the young speechwriter he had met in the 1990s. “More and more of what Dan said, I would find myself agreeing with,” he said. “At the same time, I tried not to think about it whenever possible.” With the eurozone in crisis, and signs of support for a referendum from Labour, the pressure grew. In March 2012, Boris Johnson signed the People’s Pledge. Six months later, a rebellion masterminded by Reckless defeated the government over its contribution to the EU budget. Cameron was cornered, and announced the planned referendum at Bloomberg’s London headquarters the following January. Like George Osborne, Gove argued against it. “I didn’t think offering the referendum was a good idea,” he told me. “I thought, This is being offered as a stopgap, not as a carefully considered recalibration of Britain’s relationship with Europe. It is more about dealing with an immediate political dilemma.”\\nBy then, the skeleton of the leave campaign was already in place. In August 2012, Elliott and Hannan had been invited to spend the weekend at the country house of Lord Leach – the former chair of Business for Sterling, who died 11 days before the referendum – on the Norfolk coast. Over the years, Leach had become more or less neutral on the EU question, and he had arranged a house party to discuss possible options for a referendum. Of the group, Hannan and Elliott were the most doubtful of Cameron’s ability to reform the EU. “Dan was basically, ‘He is not going to do it. Don’t believe him,” Elliott recalled. In the garden, Hannan urged Elliott to start thinking about what a Brexit campaign might look like. A year earlier, Elliott had run the winning “no” side of the referendum on the alternative vote with a message that had impressed Hannan with its bloodymindedness. Rather than engaging with the principles at stake, Elliott had focused on the cost of changing the voting system – an impressive-sounding £250m – and sent dustbin trucks apparently heaped with money through the streets of Westminster. “I thought it was the most rubbish argument ever,” Hannan said. But it worked. Behind in the polls at the start, “No to A/V” won with 67% of the vote. Elliott had also proved adept at bringing rightwing donors and thinkers to what was a dry, democratic exercise. Leach had chaired the campaign. While Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who later contributed more than £650,000 to pro-leave groups, chipped in £20,000. (In the run up to the vote, Odey bought gold and bet against house-building companies. On 24 June, as the pound collapsed, he made around £220m. “Crispin,” as a friend told me, “has the common touch of a Medici.”) The new campaign took its playbook from Business for Sterling. Elliott used the initial vehicle, Business for Britain, to set about winning friends and funding from the City. At the same time, he pondered the looming, awkward alliance with Ukip and more protectionist, anti-immigrant strains of anti-EU thinking. “We needed each other,” he told me. Based on the 2014 European election results, Elliott reckoned that the Ukip vote would be worth around 30% in the referendum. The job of Vote Leave would be to win the centre ground with a reassuring, forward-looking tone.\\nElliott compared the task to the New Labour project of the 1990s. “We needed new characters, like Gove and Boris and Gisela Stuart,” he said, “and a new message. Dan in a sense provided us with that message.” Elliott hired Cummings, as campaign director, who coined the all-important slogan, “Take Back Control”, while the deliberately crude figure of £350m per week, to describe Britain’s EU budget contribution, echoed Elliott’s successful A/V strategy. Hannan worked the political side. In the autumn of 2014, his allies Carswell and Reckless left the Tory backbenches for Ukip – one month apart – in synchronised defections designed to keep up the pressure on Cameron for a referendum, and, in theory anyway, dilute Nigel Farage’s dominance of the party. A year later, as the vote approached, and Cameron began his doomed renegotiation, Hannan reached out to Gove, Johnson, Villiers and others. “I spoke to Boris and made my pitch,” Hannan said. “The only thing I will say is that he was obviously agonising about the issues.” (Johnson did not respond to a request to comment for this article.)\\nBy the time the actual campaign was under way, Hannan’s work was more or less done. “Twenty years of inch-by-inch, person-by-person, converting those in the Conservative party to his vision,” said Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Hannan went to Vote Leave’s weekly strategy meeting, chaired by Gove, but his biggest impact on the national debate was probably subliminal. “Dan would often express views that I had myself,” said Gove, “which he would present in a crisper, more elegant and more coherent way.” At least three of Gove’s more memorable soundbites – about people being fed up with experts, joking about British MEPs losing their jobs, and comparing pro-remain economists to Nazi scientists – were Hannan lines. Villiers borrowed freely from her friend’s speeches. From needling and courting one or two “outers” in the late 1990s, Hannan watched 137 Conservative MPs announce their support for Brexit. He took part in 104 events and debates during the campaign, giving his final speech at Runnymede, where Magna Carta was agreed in 1215. He spent the night of the vote in Vote Leave’s headquarters, next door to Lambeth Palace, with Cummings and the rest of the team. (Elliott was in Birmingham.) There was no party planned. “Dominic is very puritan about these things,” said Hannan. When victory was certain, Hannan stood on a desk in the office and delivered the St Crispin’s Day speech from Henry V – “We few, we happy few, we band of brothers” – substituting the names of people who had worked on the campaign. He didn’t go to bed until midnight the following day. * * * On the Monday after the vote, at around six o’clock in the evening, Matthew Parris, the conservative columnist, found himself standing a few feet away from Hannan on College Green, outside the Houses of Parliament. Hannan was having an argument, on air, with Christiane Amanpour of CNN. When the fall of Cameron consumed other senior figures from Vote Leave, Hannan became uneasy about the way that Brexit was being reported, particularly abroad. “The story taking shape was that Britain had just voted, as it were, for Donald Trump,” he told me. Hannan took on as many interviews as he could, to put across a more positive interpretation of events, but he often found himself under hostile questioning. With Amanpour, he lost his temper. “You guys have been shouting ‘racist’ for so long,” he told CNN, “that you weren’t listening to what we were actually saying.”\\nEven by the standards of those numbing, chaotic days, Parris was taken aback by the ferocity of the encounter. “He was very uncomfortable and very angry,” Parris told me. He has known Hannan since the mid-1990s, and later accused him in the Spectator of being willing to exploit xenophobia in order to pursue his own, more abstract goals. “He has ridden a tiger, and knows the tiger he rides,” Parris wrote. “I find him a bit scary,” he said, when we spoke. “I don’t think he sees himself in politics to give effect to what the public thinks, but to what the public ought to think, which is quite different.” Hannan, naturally, cannot bear this kind of talk. When we first met, in Strasbourg, in early July, I asked him whether he really believed that the nation had voted for his free-market, internationalist version of Brexit. “Can you see how patronising that is?” he replied. “I mean, remainers are saying basically, ‘These thicko, working-class bigots weren’t listening to you. And let me now tell you – having ignored them – let me tell you what they really think.’” Instead, Hannan spoke of polls that showed that sovereignty was the primary concern of leave voters, rather than immigration, and of the economic shock that had not come. He admitted that because of the closeness of the vote, we were unlikely to become the “offshore, low-tax, global free-trading entrepôt” that he longs us to be. Hannan’s chosen Brexit would be rather soft, by current standards: something along Swiss lines, with opt-ins for various sectors to the regulations of the single market. He believes that compromise on free movement is possible, and that the Swiss government was making progress on the subject until talks were shut down before the British referendum. There is precedent, he pointed out, in his Hannanite way: EU immigration to Liechtenstein is capped at 71 people per year.\\nIt all sounded so reasonable when he talked which, of course, is Hannan’s gift. “Even if you fundamentally disagree with him, you find yourself nodding along,” said Nicky Morgan. Like other senior politicians who campaigned for remain, she disagrees with Hannan’s analysis of what drove the result, and is anxious about the future. “I think we are in the calm before the storm,” she said. Morgan has been called a traitor twice in her constituency of Loughborough, and has heard calls for the removal of a Polish community that has been there since the second world war. She didn’t hear much about free trade and parliamentary supremacy in May and June. “Talking to people who voted leave … ‘back’ was a very important word. One of the most depressing things was this, ‘I want to take our country back.’ Back to what?” Nigel Farage has his own reasons for disagreeing with Hannan. The two have not spoken since 2014. (Farage says the two fell out over his approach to immigration; Hannan says that Farage underwent “a personality change”.) We met recently, in Westminster. The celebratory moustache was gone. He was just back from the US, where he had addressed a Trump rally in Mississippi, and was smoking on the patio. He had been thinking about the similarities between the core Brexit vote, and Trump’s supporters. “It’s not the have-nothings … They have got something, but they are concerned about the change in society,” he said. “The basic feeling is that something has gone wrong; that we are not in control; that our political class aren’t the same as us, are detached from us.” Like Hannan, Farage started out making a case for why Britain should leave the European Union – around trade and sovereignty and democracy – in the early 1990s. But he realised that the argument only went so far. “It’s just not what most people are bothered about,” he said. The mystery, for Farage, is that Hannan and his group have never figured this out. “It’s cultural,” he said. “They seemed to approach the referendum as if it was an Oxford Union debate. I don’t think they have met any real people in their entire lives.” Farage said he didn’t hear much about Hannan’s free-market, open ideals on the doorstep either. “It is another disconnect isn’t it?” Is it possible for someone to crave something for so long, and then be deluded about why it happened? To strive and strive, only for the country to fall into a different, meaner, poorer future? I once asked Hannan why he had dedicated his life to getting us out of the European Union. “It was the independence issue,” he replied. “It was the idea of self-government.” I told him that – as a citizen of the same country – I still didn’t really get it. I couldn’t see the freer land that he was seeking, even now that we had cut ourselves adrift. “It’s a big philosophical difference,” said Hannan. “Between the mentality of the powerful bloc run by competent, educated people and the mentality of ‘trust the people’.” He didn’t want to be rude. “We are all conditioned by outlook, experience, genes, whatever. Two people will very often look at the same thing and have very different takes on it.” We were on a train back to London, in late August. Hannan had just spoken at a Conservative club lunch in Worthing, on the south coast, where he was the guest of honour. The lunch had been held in a small hotel. More than a hundred had turned out, a swirl of floral prints and club ties. I sat on Hannan’s table, where he remarked, thought-provokingly, on the scale of British immigration to Spain. “It is the great migration of our time,” said Hannan, pointing out that there were more British people in Spain than people of Pakistani origin in the UK. “How many of them are on benefits?”, one woman, in curls, asked promptly. Hannan ate his roast beef, smiled, and did not reply. After lunch, he rose to speak. The Olympics had just finished, and someone gave Hannan a homemade medal for his work on Brexit. The MEP thanked the room for putting him out of a job. The microphone wasn’t working, but he did not need it. With his voice high and precisely cadenced, Hannan spoke of his hopes for the years to come. “I don’t think it’s going to be difficult,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to be that hard.” And he exhorted the audience to remember great British achievements: the medals table, and two wars against German tyranny, the abolition of slavery. “The idea that we can’t now make a success of living under our own laws, trading with our friends and allies on every continent, while governing ourselves, is not worthy of a country like this one.” Hannan paused. “Cheer up my friends.” The lunchers laughed. Sunshine poured in. The cataclysm could not be felt. “Listen to the drone of the bees in lavender, and ask yourself where in the world would you rather be?” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here • This article was amended on 5 October 2016.

He founded a university society, the the Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain.', 'Britain risks a “catastrophic” Brexit because the government is so dismissive of the concerns of trade experts, according to one of the figures behind the EU-Canada trade deal which took a decade to negotiate.\\nWriting in the Observer, Jason Langrish – one of Canada’s authorities in the field – says the UK’s former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, who resigned last week and quit the civil service, was absolutely right to say that a British deal could also take a decade to strike. Langrish, who was closely involved in the prolonged Canadian talks, argues that Rogers’ analysis of the time-scale “seems realistic”, and says discussions he has had with UK government officials about Brexit suggest that there is little chance of minimising serious potential damage from the UK’s exit from the European Union. Although he has no formal role in advising the UK, Langrish has been sounded out behind the scenes by those involved with handling Brexit in Whitehall. The impression he has been left with is that unless the British government shows more flexibility it will probably have to revert to World Trade Organisation rules and common tariffs, which could lop 4% off UK GDP. Referring to his talks with UK officials, he writes: “While they have always been pleasant (and notably friendly towards Canada), my view is that they remain in campaign mode.\\n“Were they willing to realistically discuss options for Brexit, as opposed to telling you what they intend to do in a general sense while dismissing the obvious concerns, they may have a chance to minimise the damage from the potentially catastrophic decision to leave. This seems increasingly unlikely. Let’s hope that the courts, parliament and, ultimately, the electorate do it for them.” The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement has been cited by UK politicians and senior figures in other member states as a potential model for the UK to follow. In March, before the Brexit referendum, Boris Johnson, now the foreign secretary, said: “I think we can strike a deal as the Canadians have done, based on trade and getting rid of tariffs. It’s a very, very bright future I see.”\\nRogers was subject to a barrage of criticism from hardline Brexiters when it emerged that he had warned ministers that the view in Brussels was that a trade deal with the EU could be a decade at least in the making, and that even then there was no guarantee of success. Rogers quit his post last week and in a memo to staff talked of “muddled thinking” about strategy at the top of government. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said that Rogers had also resigned from the civil service and would be paid three months’ salary in lieu of his notice period. He will not receive a payoff and did not ask for one. “We are grateful for Sir Ivan’s work in Brussels and across a number of other senior positions in the civil service,” the spokesman said.', 'The number of British people who applied for Irish passports has shot up since the EU referendum. Figures released by Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs show that in June the numbers were up by 9% on 2015. But by November the increase had risen to 106%, and passport offices in London and Edinburgh had received 6,443 applications compared with just over 3,000 the year before. The UK’s decision to leave the European Union also fuelled an 80-fold increase in the number of British Sephardic Jews seeking Portuguese citizenship under a law intended to make amends for their ancestors’ expulsion from the Iberian peninsula more than 500 years ago.\\nHave you applied for a new passport since the referendum vote? Where did you apply to and why? Have you had success in getting it? What about other members of your family? Have you thought about moving too? Share your stories.', 'Politicians who want to celebrate the health of the British economy are always on the lookout for data to bolster their case, yet routinely neglect one consistent metric of success: immigration. People do not abandon the place of their birth and cross continents without expectation of a better life. It is a vote of confidence in the destination country. But it is politically difficult to celebrate this magnetism. A perception that new arrivals are on a mission to milk the benefits system and abuse the hospitality of the indigenous population is widespread yet false. Most come to work. Yet assertion of that fact doesn’t neutralise demand that the numbers come down. While the aggregate effect of immigration on GDP might be positive, the gain is meaningless in places where there is no palpable feeling of prosperity and demographic change feels sudden and uncontrolled. Those conditions did not wholly account for Britain’s vote to leave the EU but their contribution was significant enough that Theresa May has chosen to make an end to free movement of labour a non-negotiable clause of any Brexit deal. Even once ardent supporters of EU membership, such as former business secretary Vince Cable, say the economics of free movement are open to ambivalent interpretation. The PM’s decision solves a short-term problem (how to signal responsiveness to demands of many leave voters) but it brings her no closer to answering the deeper question – how to combine a border regime that is fluid enough to preserve economic dynamism and rigorous enough to inspire public confidence? . The scale of that challenge gets clearer daily. Yesterday, Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, suggested that farmers should be able to hire EU workers post-Brexit. Yet such seasonal influxes of labourers, bringing high densities of transient workers, are precisely the kind of migration that provokes resentment among longer-established populations. It is unlikely she would have suggested such a compromise last year, when drumming up leave votes. It is not just farmers who want to continue importing workers. The NHS and social care services rely on foreign-born staff. The City of London wants to hire in the global marketplace. So do universities, retailers and internationally integrated industries. One way to deal with these dilemmas is a move to more sector-specific and regional arrangements. Industries could sponsor incomers, whose immigration status would be pegged to their local job. Something along those lines is proposed in a report published today by MPs and peers. The all-party parliamentary group on social integration suggests visa devolution in imitation of Canada, where autonomous provinces help to set their own immigration requirements. This has the appeal of matching migration decisions to local conditions but is fraught with practical difficulty – the task of enforcing geographically circumscribed visas\\xa0without offence to civil liberties, for example. Canada’s arrangements are predicated on its relaxedness about overall increases in the number of people in a vast country with low population density. Those conditions do not pertain in Britain. No immigration regime for Britain can satisfy both political pressure for lower numbers and employer demands for flexibility. And there is no prospect of a return\\xa0to the culturally homogenous workplaces and town\\xa0centres of yore. Pretending otherwise, raising false hopes that the past can be restored, is a proven recipe for disappointment and anger. A wiser route would be to shift the emphasis on to conditions that give workers a greater sense of security in a labour market that offers ever fewer prospects of a job for life. That means proper enforcement of the minimum wage; punishment of gangmasters who exploit illegal migration; incentives for employers who develop the skills of their staff; and investment in retraining so that the\\xa0vagaries of the\\xa0market do not turn periods of unemployment into lifelong redundancy. That\\xa0is a long-term project to make British workers more resilient and attractive to employers. Fear of competition from foreigners will never be entirely neutralised, nor should nostalgia for the days before labour was globally mobile be dismissed as luddite or xenophobic. Those are understandable responses in a climate of insecurity. The prime minister is currently indulging the belief that Brexit will provide the necessary relief. It won’t. The demand for a better border-control regime is politically impossible to ignore, but the time is long overdue for Mrs May to show more honesty about the scale and complexity of the task.', 'Some senior civil servants who are disillusioned over preparations for Brexit are considering stepping down from their positions amid growing tensions with Downing Street. In the wake of the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers as Britain’s ambassador in Brussels, sources said some of Whitehall’s top officials are “gravely concerned” by his treatment as well as mounting problems over preparations to leave the EU. It comes after former Conservative ministers questioned the impartiality of Rogers and the wider civil service, as Number 10 and the foreign office declined to comment. The appointment of Sir Tim Barrow as Rogers’s replacement on Wednesday night is unlikely to mask the wider strains between some mandarins and ministers over Britain’s plans to trigger article 50 by the end of March.\\nComplaints from mandarins include the points that May’s office has centralised control, lacks communication skills and has been too quick to adopt a confrontational style with those offering independent advice. Whitehall sources said senior civil servants from several departments are considering stepping down from their positions. However, it is “too soon” to say whether this is part of a one-off exodus of talent or part of a cyclical loss of staff, one source added. Rogers’s sudden resignation on Tuesday, weeks before Brexit negotiations are due to start, prompted a flurry of media appearances by Iain Duncan Smith on Wednesday. The former welfare secretary claimed that Rogers had leaked information embarrassing to ministers, was not trusted and was among a group of civil servants who too unthinkingly accepted the word of other EU nations. “The truth is, I think there’s a little bit of sour grapes going on here because he’s not really included much in the discussion about how they are going to go about this negotiation, partly because … I think ministers don’t fully trust him,” the former Conservative leader said.\\nAnother former minister, Peter Lilley, also accused Rogers of “sour grapes”, while Tory MP Dominic Raab said that the senior diplomat’s “heart hasn’t really been in Brexit” and his resignation would be “quietly, cautiously and respectfully welcomed at the top of government”. The criticisms prompted an unusually strong defence from the head of the top civil servants’ union who accused May of failing to back the independence of its senior mandarins. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, said the prime minister was “sitting back” as Rogers and the role of the civil service as a whole was criticised. “It doesn’t surprise me that some politicians are calling for pro-Brexit civil servants to be appointed. What surprises me is the deafening silence from ministers who should be taking to the airwaves to defend the integrity and capability of the impartial civil service,” he said. “The prime minister herself has publicly criticised civil servants, trivialised those who suggest [the civil service is] being under-resourced and now sits back as key officials are pilloried by a succession of former ministers. “If the civil service is to deliver a successful Brexit negotiation the recipe for that success is unlikely to be [to] starve it of resources, lack clarity of objective, and surround yourself with yes men and women who won’t speak truth unto power.” Penman also took exception to claims that Rogers had leaked information to the press in December when it emerged that the diplomat had written that it could take 10 years to negotiate an EU trade deal.\\nPenman said: “Undermining civil servants and saying they are responsible for leaks when every journalist knows that leaks are more likely to come from politicians and special advisers only further toxifies the role the civil service will have to play in these negotiations. “This undermines the civil service’s ability to deliver a successful Brexit. Duncan Smith’s comments are the latest example of this.” Rogers was also defended by Peter Ricketts, who was the head civil servant at the Foreign Office, and national security adviser under David Cameron. “There’s absolutely no evidence for that, and I’m afraid it’s a bit of a smear against Ivan Rogers,” Lord Ricketts said of the leak accusation. The information was, he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One, more likely to have been “leaked from the centre with a political motive”. Ricketts argued against the idea of Rogers’s successor needing to be a Brexit supporter: “A civil servant has got to be there to give ministers fearless, unvarnished advice, the reality as they see it. “This idea that you’ve got to have somebody who is pro-Brexit politicises the civil service in a way that we’ve never done in this country.” In a 1,400-word farewell email to his staff, Rogers said civil servants still do not know the government’s Brexit priorities and “serious multilateral negotiating experience is in short supply in Whitehall”. It is understood that Rogers, known for his strong opinions, maintained a close relationship with May when they worked together at the Home Office.\\nHowever, he fell out with her aides in December when it emerged that the diplomat had written a memo saying that it could take 10 years to negotiate an EU trade deal. Rogers’s allies denied claims he had leaked the paper and said he had instead been undermined by May’s top advisers, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, after Downing Street failed to back him. Labour has called for David Davis, the Brexit secretary, to make a statement to the House of Commons about Rogers’s resignation when MPs return from their Christmas break on Monday. Rogers may have a chance to explain his version of events. He has been invited to give evidence to the European scrutiny committee early this year and has been told the invitation still stands.', 'Compared with their American counterparts, British civil servants have, in theory, somewhat less to fear from recent political upheaval. While more than 4,000 new political appointees will parachute in to run federal departments, agencies and embassies after Donald Trump is sworn in, most of those required to navigate Britain’s equally momentous departure from the EU remain career officials, answering to whichever politicians are in power. But the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers, Britain’s permanent representative to the EU, has reopened debates dating back centuries over whether such an independent structure is fit for purpose in today’s highly politicised Whitehall environment.\\nEurosceptics rejoiced at his departure, claiming his warnings about the difficulties of Brexit were symbolic of bureaucratic resistance to the will of the British people. Civil service representatives have hit back at the failure of ministers to defend the principle that their mandarins need to provide impartial advice, regardless of whether it is what political masters want to hear. Unhappiness about Brexit among civil servants is no surprise. Many have built careers around becoming experts in the complex interplay between Brussels and Whitehall. Such was the level of private misgiving after June’s referendum result that one government lawyer has said there was an informal self-help group to provide counselling sessions to officials struggling to cope with implementing something they felt was a terrible mistake.\\nBut those who know him dispute suggestions that our man in Brussels had simply gone native. “The irony is that Ivan Rogers was part of a Treasury takeover of European relations because they were seen as less easily captured by foreigners,” says Mark Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “If now even this expertise is being swept away too, you are seeing a double undermining of the professional classes.” Following similar Downing Street anger at an independent report that warned an additional 30,000 civil servants were needed to implement Brexit, there is a growing fear in Whitehall that politicians no longer want to hear bad news, even when presented neutrally. “This is probably the most difficult clash between politicians and the civil service that the country has seen for a generation,” says Leonard. “The message that it sends out to the rest of the civil service is that if you put a political foot wrong you could be out on your ear. It will send shockwaves through the system.” “The only thing I can think with parallels is the run-up to the Iraq war, where there were similar deep misgivings in Whitehall about the political direction,” he adds. The Foreign Office still has a long way to go before it reaches Washington levels of politicisation. Most US ambassadors to plum postings in wealthier countries are not just political appointees, but have been rewarded as the president’s richest donors. Theresa May was said to have resisted parachuting in an overtly political replacement for Rogers, such as Brexit champions Michael Gove and Nigel Farage. Ironically, the critical interview given by the prime minister that first raised fears among civil servants also included instructions to them to give her unvarnished advice. There was a “a tendency in the system to try to interpret what they think you want, and to deliver that”, she told the Spectator last month. “Don’t try to tell me what you think I want to hear. I want your advice, I want the options,” she said. Yet waves of cuts in Whitehall in recent years have left the austerity-ravaged machinery of government feeling unloved and under-resourced at the best of times. The consequences of a disorderly Brexit, where UK civil servants have to suddenly step in and perform the countless “competences” now devolved to the EU, could put intolerable strain on an already creaking system. In this context, the fear is not that the government will suddenly decide to make hundreds of US-style political appointments, but that much-needed talent will be sidelined if it is seen as out of step with the prevailing mood. “It will mean politicisation more like other European countries, such as France where you have a hybrid civil service,” says Leonard. In such systems there are few direct political appointees, but many top officials whose political persuasions are well known; who thrive under a certain type of government and linger in more junior roles when it is out of power. It would be an ironic twist for British mandarins if the escape from European bureaucracy left them looking more like their continental cousins.', 'The number of people who applied for Irish passports from Britain in 2016 was 42% higher than the year before the Brexit vote, figures from the Irish government have shown. The figures, released by Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs, show that in June the numbers were up by 9% on 2015. But by November the increase had risen to 106%, and passport offices in London and Edinburgh received 6,443 applications compared to just over 3,000 the year before.\\nJust under 65,000 people applied for an Irish passport in 2016. Ireland’s minister for foreign affairs and trade, Charles Flanagan, described 2016 as “an exceptionally busy year for the passport service” and said he expected the trend to continue in the coming years. The country’s London embassy was forced to take on extra staff last year to deal with the increase. Irish citizenship rules are among the most accommodating in Europe. Anyone who has a parent who was an Irish citizen at the time of their birth is entitled to an Irish passport. Citizenship can also be claimed if one grandparent is, or was, an Irish citizen born in Ireland even if the applicant has no parent born in the country. Applications from Northern Ireland, where residents in all communities are entitled to both an Irish and a British passport, rose by 27% to almost 70,000. Anyone born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is entitled to an Irish passport. Following the EU referendum, Ian Paisley Jr, a Democratic Unionist party politician, urged constituents to get an Irish passport if they wanted one. “My advice is, if you are entitled to second passport then take one … take as many as you can especially if you travel to different world trouble zones,” he tweeted.', 'Who could fail to enjoy the developing stories of the Brexit movie? If you missed this one in the New Year haze, it concerns “very serious Hollywood people” being interested in making a movie of The Bad Boys of Brexit, a book of the campaign penned by Leave.EU financier Arron Banks. As far as casting is concerned, Banks declares that he sees Matt Damon playing him, while Farage laments the fact that Ollie Reed’s death rules him out of the running to give us his Nigel. According to Banks’s comms chap, Andy Wigmore: “We have three interested parties in the rights to the book, and we will be meeting representatives from three studios, including a Netflix representative, on Jan 19 in Washington, DC. We have invited all of them to our pre-inaugural drinks party … We have also invited many of Trump’s team to the event.” The one thing any major Hollywood studio executive needs to know about said bad boys is that they are absolutely not out-of-towners. “Effectively, that book is like a screenplay,” judges Wigmore, “so half the work’s been done for them.” I like how Andy’s putting the academy on notice there: don’t you dare shunt this into Best Adapted – it’s Best Original and we will pull our participation at the Kodak theatre if you dick us around. Lost in Showbiz will be checking in with the status of the project at every possible stage of its journey to development hell, and as soon as I know more, so will you.', 'Slashing regulations for farmers will be the government’s key priority for the agriculture sector as Britain leaves the European Union, the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has promised. Speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference, Leadsom announced one specific plan would be to end the “three-crop rule”, a measure designed to promote biodiversity on larger farms. This prompted criticism from the Green party, who called the idea “environmental irresponsibility”. Leadsom, who has made few public pronouncements since taking the job in July, said too much time and money had been wasted on keeping up and complying with EU red tape. She said: “Over the past six years we’ve done everything we can to reduce this burden, but I’m quite sure everyone here can still think of at least one piece of EU regulation you won’t miss. “Now, as we prepare to leave the EU, I will be looking at scrapping the rules that hold us back and focusing instead on what works best for the UK.” The three-crop rule, which was agreed by EU agriculture ministers in 2013, decrees that some larger farms must grow a variety of crops. The measure is designed to mitigate the impact modern mass farming can have on the environment and local biodiversity and is unpopular with many British farmers. However, the Greens condemned the plan. Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP who sits on the European parliament’s agricultural committee, said the government seemed “determined to dive headlong into encouraging damaging monocultures”. Leadsom’s announcement came on the day that a committee of MPs warned that departure from the EU could spell big problems for wildlife and habitats.\\nThe Commons environmental audit committee said there could still be issues even if EU regulations were incorporated into UK law, and warned farmers could face a cut in income after Brexit. The government has guaranteed farmers will receive the same level of financial support until at least 2020. Leadsom said her department’s rural development programme would provide an additional £120m to support rural growth. However, the bulk of her address focused on what Leadsom argued was a “big potential win for farmers” through a promised bonfire of EU regulations on agriculture. “No more 6ft EU billboards littering the landscape,” she said. “No more existential debates to determine what counts as a bush, a hedge, or a tree. And no more ridiculous, bureaucratic three-crop rule. “By cutting the red tape that comes out of Brussels, we will free our farmers to grow more, sell more and export more great British food whilst upholding our high standards for plant and animal health and welfare.” The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) welcomed her speech. Ross Murray, the CLA’s president, said: “Brexit presents the best possible prospect to design new rules to govern the way we farm and manage land. We can achieve increased productivity and improved environmental outcomes though a new world-leading food, farming and environmental policy and we are committed to working with ministers to deliver on this once-in-a-generation opportunity.”', 'Brexit could harm the UK’s wildlife and farming, according to a cross-party committee of MPs, with key protections left as ineffective “zombie legislation” and farmers facing a “triple jeopardy” of lost subsidies, export tariffs and increased competition. A new report from the environmental audit select committee warns that many of the rules governing food production and the environment in the UK come from EU law and that weakening of these rules would damage the countryside and reduce the viability of farms, food security and safety. The MPs said that for the government to meet its manifesto commitment to “be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it found it”, ministers must commit to passing a new Environmental Protection Act before it triggers article 50 and starts the formal process of leaving the EU. The MPs said it was concerning that the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, gave no reassurance that farmers would receive subsidies after 2020. But the report also recommended that if a new subsidy regime was put in place, it should focus less on direct income support to farmers and more on delivering public goods, such as preventing flooding, tackling climate change and boosting wildlife.\\n“Changes from Brexit could put our countryside, farming and wildlife at risk,” said Mary Creagh, chair of the environmental audit committee (EAC). “Protections for Britain’s wildlife and special places currently guaranteed under European law could end up as ‘zombie legislation’, even with the great repeal bill.” Creagh said food, animal welfare and environmental standards had to be maintained as the UK seeks new trade deals with other countries. “The government must not trade away these key protections [and] it should also give clarity over any future farm subsidies.” There are about 800 pieces of EU environmental legislation, covering wildlife and habitats, water quality, farming, food and fisheries. The government’s great repeal bill intends to transpose all those rules into UK law, but Leadsom told the EAC that about a third would be difficult to transpose. The EAC said that, without pre-emptive action, these rules would end up as “zombie legislation”, with no body to enforce them, no updates and easily eroded by ministers via parliamentary statutory instruments, which receive minimal scrutiny from MPs. The EU’s common agricultural policy provides £3.5bn a year in subsidies to UK farmers, making up more than half of their income, and the MPs said Brexit posed a “triple jeopardy” for farmers. Firstly the loss of subsidies would threaten the viability of some farms. Secondly, new export tariffs would cut farm incomes and, thirdly, new trading relationships could lead to competition with nations with lower animal welfare, food safety and environmental standards. If the UK chooses not to be part of the EU single market, Tim Breitmeyer of the Country, Land and Business Association told the EAC that lamb exports to Europe would face tariffs of 30% and that beef export tariffs could be above 50%.\\nEven if the UK remained in the single market, the MPs said crucial EU directives such as those protecting habitats, birds and beaches, would have to be replaced as they are excluded from that agreement. “The government should safeguard protections for Britain’s wildlife and special places in a new Environmental Protection Act,” said Creagh. A government spokeswoman said: “The UK has a long history of wildlife and environmental protection and we are committed to safeguarding and improving these, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.” Vicki Hird, from Sustain, an alliance for better food and farming, said: “MPs have correctly identified a huge risk to the UK farming system and environment from Brexit and new trade agreements. Without environmental safeguards in place, [this] would mean major damage to the natural environment – the soils, pollinators and water – on which farming and everyone depends.” Sam Hall, at the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said: “Brexit is an opportunity to improve the UK’s environment. The MPs rightly suggest new legislation could be needed to guarantee existing protections post-Brexit. But a new bill could go further and increase the level of ambition for the natural environment”, for example with tougher pollution controls. Sam Lowe, at Friends of the Earth, said any changes to environmental protection must be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and not made via statutory instruments: “No one voted to ‘take back control’ for the UK parliament, only to hand it straight over to a minister, brandishing a red pen, with the power to delete vital nature protections on a whim.”', 'Theresa May will make a major speech on Brexit in an attempt to quell criticism that the government is not yet clear on its negotiating objectives for exiting the EU, as former diplomats hit out at the intense levels of criticism that ministers and civil servants have had to operate under.\\nThe foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the Brexit secretary, David Davis, are contributing to the speech, expected later in January. It is expected to address Britain’s access to the European single market and a new immigration system for EU citizens. May will restate that control of borders will be a red line for the government, inevitably making economic access a lower priority. That means the government must be prepared for Britain to stop being a full member of the single market, although the prime minister has said she has an objective to secure maximum access for companies to trade with the EU. Sir Ivan Rogers, who quit as the UK’s ambassador to the EU on Tuesday, sent a resignation letter in which he urged his staff and successor to challenge “ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking” – interpreted as an attack on Downing Street. “We do not yet know what the government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK’s relationship with the EU after exit,” he wrote.\\nHis successor, the former ambassador to Moscow Sir Tim Barrow, was appointed within 36 hours of Rogers’ departure, and was described by Downing Street as “a seasoned and tough negotiator, with extensive experience of securing UK objectives in Brussels”. Tom Fletcher, the former ambassador to Lebanon, said there was frustration among civil servants in Whitehall not only with ministers, but with criticism from outside that the Brexit project was in a state of chaos and insistences they should be more transparent. “I think people feel the scale of the challenge is enormous but we’ve got a lot of our best people on it,” he said. “I think people get a bit fed up of ‘why aren’t we being more open with the plans?’ Muhammad Ali didn’t brief everyone in advance on Rumble in the Jungle. “Most of all, I think people are sick of the constant criticism. West Ham players perform much better when they’re not being booed by their own side the whole time. We need to let our people get on with it now.” Fletcher said Barrow had showed he was a tough negotiator during his time in Moscow, as well as his previous experience in Brussels. “I’ve seen him in Brussels, he knows the corridors, he knows the characters,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “But more importantly, I’ve seen him in Moscow dealing with Putin there at a very testing time for our relationship and Tim had a reputation for being bulletproof out there. People often say diplomats have an iron fist in a velvet glove, I’ve seen his iron glove as well.”\\nSir Robert Cooper, a former UK diplomat who is now a European commission official, said he expected that diplomats such as Barrow would “spend as least as much time negotiating with your own side as with the other side”. Decisions had to be made in cooperation, Cooper said. “It’s no good people in Whitehall negotiating with themselves. It’s very important Tim should be involved in all the discussions going on in London,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today. Diplomats and politicians should brush off criticism from outside, he said. “What really matters in the end is the 27 [EU countries], you have to understand what they are thinking.” Lord Marland, chairman of the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council and a former trade envoy under David Cameron, expressed concerns about the government’s ability to conduct tough negotiations. He said that politicians needed to lead the negotiations because civil servants were not well-equipped to do so. He said: “My fear is that Whitehall as a whole has really not got the skill set to deliver a really hard-nosed negotiation and I think we have really got to upskill in that area to do it. If you’re too hard on negotiation you don’t win. Any negotiation has got to have something that’s in it for both parties.”']\n",

According to the Nielson Group, 30% of web users have lower literacy, which is reading around an 8th grade level. Based on word frequencies, we can see if changing word frequencies could allow for a different range of audience.\n",

    "Another item we want to analyze is frequency of words and relate them to certain tags. For example, The Guardian API has a tag for \"star-rating\" which would allow us to see what words appear in popular and unpopular items.  This could help us determine if based on certain words if an article will be popular. We can also find relationships between word frequency and article contributors, production-office, and section. We could determine based on word frequencies if an article will contain a certain tag.\n"
